We explore how materiality and familiarity of design tools impact participation, by investigating an off-the-shelf, familiar material—the Rubik’s cube, for application possibilities as an unconventional design material. We report on a series of workshops with design practitioners and educators, that find disassociating design methods with tradition materials, opens new possibilities for methodological innovations while revealing promising avenues to improve participation. We categorise lessons into three themes: material properties, staging considerations and emergent practices. This is supplemented by two Illustrative examples of emergent applications of using Rubik’s cubes to augment (1) de Bono’s random input method; and (2) creating dynamic persona states. The emergent applications present new material possibilities enabling design methods to innovate and evolve.",

      "abstract": "In a human-AI co-creation, AI not only categorizes, evaluates and interprets data but also generates new content and interacts with humans. As co-creative AI is a form of intelligent technology that directly involves humans, it is critical to anticipate and address ethical issues during all design stages. The open-ended nature of human-AI interactions in co-creation poses many challenges for designing ethical co-creative AI systems. Researchers have been exploring ethical issues associated with autonomous AI in recent years, but ethics in human-AI co-creativity is a relatively new research area. In order to design human-centered ethical AI, it is important to understand the perspectives, expectations, and ethical concerns of potential users. In this paper, we present a study with 18 participants to explore ethical dilemmas and challenges in human-AI co-creation from the perspective of potential users using design fiction (DF). DF is a speculative research method that depicts a new concept or technology through stories as an intangible prototype. We present the findings from the study as potential users' concerns, stances and expectations around ethical challenges in human-AI co-creativity to devise guidelines for designing human-centered ethical AI partners for human-AI co-creation.",

We display the visualization in a Hololens headset and provide features that allow to manipulate it in order to understand and learn Duncan's qualities and choreographic style.\r\nThrough a workshop with dancers, we run a structured observation where we compared qualitatively how the dancers were able to perceive Duncan’s qualities and embody them using the system set according to two different conditions: 1) displaying all the future keyframes or 2) displaying a limited number of keyframes. We discuss the results of our workshop and more generally the use of augmented reality in the studio for pedagogical purposes.",

      "abstract": "Image generation entered the mainstream with the spread of large machine learning (ML) models capable of generating artistic images from text. AI art enthusiasts generated millions of images online within a few months, revealing the future social, economic, and legal consequences of text-to-image (TTI) generation.  This work explores the multifaceted sociology and practices behind this yet understudied phenomenon. \r\nWe aim to understand text-to-image practitioners, their motivations, practice, and the usability challenges they face in order to envision creative and meaningful interactions with this technology. We analyzed two sets of data, an online questionnaire answered by 64 practitioners gathered on social media groups and DiffusionDB, a large dataset of user text prompts sent to the Stable Diffusion generative model. The questionnaire results suggest that TTI generation is a recreational activity from narrow socio-professional groups whose users employ auxiliary techniques across platforms and beyond request-response interactions. Inherent model limitations and finding suitable prompt formulation are their main problems. The analysis of the DiffusionDB dataset informed the creation of a taxonomy for prompt specifiers and a corresponding model capable of recognizing the semantic content of unseen prompts, which further informed how practitioners structure TTI prompt. We finally discuss the design and socio-technical implications of our research for creativity support.",

      "abstract": "In this pictorial, we followed a Research through Design (RtD) inquiry where we explored the concept of loops as a design material. Using an Ethnographic design methodology, we aimed to create artifacts that represent the ways in which content can be repeated, distorted and modified in loops. Our process consisted firstly of the practice of noticing loops in everyday life. This led us to curate a portfolio of loops’ occurrences in objects and living organisms from our surroundings. Secondly, we organized the loops that we noticed in a typology and created a score that instantiates such a variety of loops. Finally, we followed the score to produce 1. knitting work, 2. woodwork, 3. lino printing, and 4. dance performances as art-based physicalizations of different instances of loops. Our study of loops uncovers a designerly way to reflect on a daily phenomenon (loops) through making physical artifacts and dancing.",

Over an intensive five-week period, students explored model making, slow drawing, and digital media through a multifaceted workflow process. Multiple tools and techniques were investigated at varying scales. Ideas were conceptualized through prototyping, graphite pattern explorations, and computer graphic representations. Artifacts produced revealed unique forms threaded through each medium utilized. Final models, drawings, and representations express the concept of abstractions across mediums to generate space and form. ",

In collaboration with data visualisation expert David Hunter from University of Colorado at Boulder, and visual artist Zach Duer from Virginia Tech, dAnCing LiNes explores how dance can generate a choreographic view of drawing through mediated representation. In this respect the artwork produced for dAnCing LiNes is not intended as a means of documentation of the live events but as a tool for new artistic production. The intention is to rethink performative drawing beyond the gestural trace of the body in movement through the use of data visualisations. Capturing chorographic scores and task-based instructions through digital technologies, the data visualisations explore how the agency of dance moves from the performative to the visual via technological means by using combinations of established computer vision techniques from OpenCV [1] like Optical Flow, Blob Detection. The visualisations not only reveal the rules of the underlying choreography in each location but also computationally play with and exemplify those rules on a per location basis (five in total).  ",

Abstracting the creative notions of choreography, graphics and comfort, the artwork uses an ethnographic survey of living conditions in low-cost flats in Malaysia during the recent Covid-19 pandemic and an architectural representation of a 300-year-old traditional Malay house called Istana Puteri Bongsu. Centering the use on the issue of thermal comfort, a series of thermal images of the human body in various choreographed postures were filmed against the background of a traditional Malay house. The images were then fed into an AI platform to generate a new set of images that were morphed into each other. This creates a surrealist abstraction of what we term as ‘thermal choreography’ that complicates the polemics of organic architecture and cultural wisdom in adapting human thermal comfort to the natural environment.",

COVID-19 restrictions, such as social distancing and remote learning, disrupted social development and identity formation in young adults, exacerbating mental health issues that remain unaddressed in the existing STEAM curriculum. Young adults are vulnerable to psychological distress that adversely affects educational experiences and career path choices. The Code to Cope curriculum was adopted by the creative coding course at [institution] from 2021 to 2022. We conducted selected interviews with 4 students in 2021 and empirical studies with 34 students in 2022 to evaluate the effects of the curriculum in terms of code, coping, and creativity. The results of the study show that the Code to Cope curriculum effectively teaches computational thinking, develops self-care practices, and engages and motivates students.",

In this work, artefacts are only represented by the images of their textures. When the users point their mouse on a texture, the pointer will change into either a fingernail or a coin. They can zoom in and out using the mouse scroll button or the up and down keyboard keys. Whilst zooming, they can hear the sound each texture makes as it is scratched by a fingernail or a coin. The users can guess the materials of the textures on the quiz page. Thus far, people have been able to guess the materials correctly.",

The framework for creative production is collaborative – between people, technologies, and material agency. NEEDLE WORK translates micro-scale craft gestures, into human-scale three dimensional robotic light drawings. The light drawings inform human-robot interaction, exploring a mode of generative choreography as an aesthetics of change, viewing a sequence of gestures as chapters in performance. The conceptual lens focusses on process-oriented qualities and embodies a relational aesthetic view of agency that engages the dynamism between entities. Performing immaterial praxis of intangible cultural heritage crafts explores the creative potential of co-design, engaging human, machine, and material agency, and opens new perspectives to understand and interpret the value of craft.

      "abstract": "Digital transformation is increasingly blurring the line between what is software and what is the world, requiring designers to harmoniously blend digital and physical products, services and spaces if they want to orchestrate meaningful experiences that are specifically aimed at the interweaving relationships between people, places and things. Traditional approaches to product design, interaction design, and user experience design do not often take this new context into account. The pictorial details the results of a twelve-day workshop focusing on real-world audience and performer problems during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe: it illustrates how two distinct tools, the Blended Experiences Tool and the Evaluation Tool, focusing on the creation of a blended experience and respectively meant to provide a structured way to approach the generative and reflective stages of the design process, can be used to address this gap. This pictorial illustrates the theoretical framing supporting the Blended Experiences Tool; describes how the workshop produced Laugh Traders, a speculative experience centering on attending and reviewing comedy shows; provides a page-by-page pictorial storyboard of the Laugh Trader experience; introduces the Evaluation Tool and applies it to Laugh Trader to measure the relevance, complexity, and attractiveness of the resulting blended experience. Preliminary reflections conclude the pictorial.",

      "abstract": "Practitioners and students have increasingly adopted online whiteboards to facilitate collaborative design work. While such whiteboards provide endless space for ideating and curating, this can be challenging for non-experts who are less familiar with the design process. In these cases, templates provide novices with a more structured process and procedural guidance to fill gaps in expertise. However, few studies explore the effects of templates on creativity in free-form environments. Does the structure hinder free expression? How is creativity enabled within and around those scaffolds? Through a mixed-methods study with 114 introductory design students (34 teams), we found that templates give novices quick access to expert processes and enable teams to conceptually align with each other and with prior work sessions. The study also shows how novices worked creatively within and around the scaffolding. We observed visual patterns of free-form curation where concepts were spatially organized, clustered, color-coded, and connected using arrows and lines. We offer design implications for creating free-form templates and discuss the value of this approach for design settings with diversely skilled audiences.\r\n",

      "abstract": "This pictorial paper explores domestic sounds’ capacity to evoke imagery of everyday inhabited spaces. In recent decades, accelerated digitalization has been transforming our everyday sonic environment, and new interactive possibilities, such as multimodal and embodied interaction, draw attention to sound as a communicative medium. In that context, how can artificial product sounds integrate into the present ecology heard at home?\r\nThis pictorial includes visual impressions of domestic sounds as documented in Japan through a sound diary experiment, and those drawn by their listeners during a participatory exhibition in Tel-Aviv. The drawings offer insight into the creative sense-making strategies that listeners employ to situate acousmatic sounds within the interrelated composition of their everyday auditory experience. Furthermore, they demonstrate drawing as a unique research tool for constructing and sharing meaning during the product sound design process. By contemplating drawing as a creative output and a reflective cognition process, this initial multimodal exploration highlights the participatory nature of domestic sound interactions, and the opportunities posed by drawing for designing future home soundscapes.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we describe a qualitative study investigating how artists work with a scalable and distributed audio-visual installation system that utilises IoT technology. With no prior experience of the system invited artists incorporated the new technology according to a creative brief for a public performance. We examined how they (i) built an understanding of the technology's affordances, (ii) refined their creative goals, and (iii) deployed collaborative strategies to achieve creative outcomes. We examine how the artists worked from the examples we provided to integrate our audio-visual system and develop their creative work. We identify three distinct creative strategies and use these to suggest ways that the design of examples, presets and readymade configurations can be successfully integrated into interfaces for new creative technologies.",

      "abstract": "Establishing, maintaining, and making use of collections of ideas and sources of inspiration is a common and important practice for music artists. Yet, it is underexplored in research. We therefore examine the research question of how do music artists capture and manage their ideas? In order to get an overview of the general patterns in the workflows of music artists, as well as in-depth understandings of these practices and the perceptions of music artists, our method combines qualitative surveys (n=51) with in-depth qualitative interviews (n=15). We find that a set of values are foundational to idea management routines that originate in music artists' perceptions of what makes an idea “good”. We also identify the different forms that musical ideas can take in idea collections, what drives their retrieval, characteristic development approaches, and different styles for collaborating on ideas. Finally, we discuss recommendations for the design of tools for supporting idea management in music.",

Since 2008 the building has been closed, and is slowly falling into disrepair. In 2021, a collective of filmmakers, architects, curators and students came together to create a virtual version of the building, using the original architectural drawings. The Mozilla Hubs space, which we call AFAAB (Ant Farm Antioch Art Building) in VR is simultaneously a virtual gathering space, an archival exhibition space, and a workshop for re-envisioning the building itself. We envision this space as a location for collapsing the real and the virtual, the past and the present. Students can see how the building was constructed and peer through layers of time via an archive of different eras of creative activity in the space.",

What technologies of today can we use to understand our own concerns of a climate future analogous to the way pre-historic humans drew their conceptions onto the cave? HUMAN ENOUGH uses machine learning-generated visions of climate futures (Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, etc) and climate adaptions / potential solutions (ChatGPT) in a creative space (Gather) to reconstruct a modern analog of the age-old cave painting. It then constructs the machine visions into physical installed objects using recycled, organic, found materials from site-specific builds for physical exhibition. The outcome is a collective imagining of our climate future and our adaptions to it from a technological and material perspective.",

The project is an extract of our body and generates virtual lives (birds, trees, and snakes). The new creatures build new societies based on computer algorithms and mimic human society and behaviors. The audience creates new organisms by putting their hands or objects into the white box in the physical installation space. Their input becomes a flock of birds, a group of trees, or snakes in the projected virtual environment. Participants can get immersed in the virtual environment through a projection or a VR headset. In the virtual environment with a VR headset, they can navigate the world that is full of the dynamism of the trees, birds, and snakes by walking or teleporting using the Oculus controllers. The organisms go through a life cycle (birth, growth, interact, death and re-birth) and provide various interactions to the participants. Currently the artist team is working on integrating participants’ narratives with generative organisms in the environment. In the VR environment, participants can experience the space through multiple sensory channels. \r\n\r\n",

      "abstract": "The ability to visually discern shape, form, and value is fundamental to observational drawing. However, developing this skill requires a drawer to perceive a “raw” version of the scene being drawn, often referred to as regaining the innocence of the eye. This work investigates how interactive projected light cues can be used to alter the perception of drawing objects and understand how users might control their own perception. We introduce an augmented reality system capable of dynamically projecting interactive light cues onto objects within a live drawing studio. We present the design of three cues that address challenging percepts for novice drawers: gauging proportion, discerning shape, and shifting visual attention. In a formal user study with novice and intermediate drawers, we evaluate the effectiveness of these cues in supporting observational drawing. We demonstrate how cues can be designed to correct subconscious errors and visually guide users in learning to draw. We also discuss the role of augmented reality in supporting cognition in physical skill development.",

      "abstract": "Ten Thousand Thoughts is an artwork by multimedia artist Esther Rolinson. It is an extendable immersive programmed light installation. It is built from a sculptural material made by the artist that can be altered to sit within each environment. As a result it is unique on each showing. It was initiated originally through a proposal for a public artwork and has since gone on to be created as an installation work suitable for showing in public spaces and gallery settings. It is derived from a series of drawings created to understand and evolve the material. In this work the rules of construction present in the 2 dimensional images are directly translated into the 3 dimensions and computer software.

      "abstract": " This paper examines the art practices, artwork, and motivations of prolific users of the latest generation of text-to-image (TTI) models. Through interviews, observations, and a survey, we provide a sampling of TTI artwork and find that: 1) the text prompt and the resulting image combine into a single art piece (prompts as art), and 2) prompt templates (prompts with ``slots'' for others to fill in with their own words) are developed to create generative art pieces. We discover that the desire for unique outputs leads artists to seek specialized vocabulary to produce distinctive art pieces (e.g., by adopting words from architecture). We also find that some artists look for ``glitches'' in the model that can be turned into artistic styles of their own right. From these findings, we outline specific implications for this emergent group of prompt artists.",

      "abstract": "During listening to music, the brain expects specific acoustic events based on learned musical rules. During music performance expectancy is additionally created based on motor action by linking keypresses to their sounds. We investigated EEG (Electroencephalography) signals to auditory expectancy violations in piano performance and perception. In our study, pianists experienced manipulations of different acoustic features, such as pitch and loudness, during playing and listening to piano sequences. We found that manipulations during performance elicited deflections with stronger amplitudes compared to manipulations during perception indicating that the action of producing sounds strengthens auditory expectancy. Loudness manipulations, violating musical regularity, elicited deflections with smaller latencies compared to pitch manipulations, which violate harmonic expectancy, suggesting that the brain processes expectancy violations of distinct acoustic features in a different way. These EEG signatures may prove useful for applications in intelligent music interfaces by providing information about sensory-motor accuracy.",

As both an action and a thing, the picture can mean more than it is generally designed for. As disconnected from traditional owner and authorship, found photographs, in particular, aid reflection on the processes that birth images, their meanings, and their value. As an artistic installation, \"Finding Found Photobooks\" utilizes iterative events for re-contextualizing photographs to induce an organic, processual-reflective reading of their content. Using a research through design approach to photobook design and art installation, this work foregrounds reoccurring compositional techniques, image content, and imaging technology as aesthetic concerns available to the viewing public. Therefore, viewers may recognize their personal biases for meaning-making while observing the act of observation presented in the books. Doing so affords the experience of \"Finding Found Photobooks.\"",

The artists will explore intuitive, spontaneous animation processes that rely on poetic responses from a selected artist-collaborator. The collaborator’s responses will then translate into new animation iterations, using the process of making as described above. The intention is to create a thought-provoking artwork, where the evolving abstract animations are projected onto multiple screens and accompanied by the collaborators’ spoken word responses. When the audience enters the installation, they will experience a changeable, meaningful, and mediative space.",

      "abstract": "HCI researchers are continually exploring new ways of engaging the public in participatory design and bringing creative making research activities to new audiences. In this paper, we interviewed individuals who independently began public and DIY installations for sharing miniature art among their neighbours. During the COVID-19 pandemic, participatory miniature art exchanges, commonly known as Free Little Art Galleries (FLAGs), organically spread in response to lockdowns and institutional constraints. These art exchanges were boxes, often posted at the edge of an individual's lawn, where communities could drop off and take miniature art pieces. In this qualitative study, we interviewed 20 FLAG `curators' to understand the implications involved in setting up and maintaining these long-term deployments. From the analysis of these interviews, we provide 6 practical recommendations on supporting these types of deployments, and discuss how HCI researchers can expand upon these DIY participatory practices to bring creative ideation activities on the future of technology to broader audiences.

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a new method for quantifying open-ended collaborative embodied improvisation: Observable Creative Sense-Making (OCSM). This technique builds on previous work on Creative Sense-Making (CSM), examines its shortcomings, and addresses it by reformalizing and grounding CSM in current literature from embodied social cognition and an intersubjective perspective of creativity. We apply this method to empirical studies of human collaboration in dance improvisation with 16 advanced college dancers and establish the method's validity. The OCSM method described in this paper includes a qualitative coding technique, a web-based tool for coding the interaction, and the cognitive theory behind its application.",

      "abstract": "Travel is an integral part of our lives, whether for work or leisure. Since the advent of photography, we have documented our journeys, often sharing the images with friends and family to reflect upon the experience, tell stories, or invite commentary. We often lose ourselves in digital media – film, documentary and games – particularly during times when physical travel is unavailable. In this pictorial, we explore the travels of a single player through hundreds of games, presenting annotated game screenshots as photo-documentary through gamescapes, and as a form of the New Games Journalism. We present a New Games Travelogue traversing and formulating the psychogeography of games as imaginary places, and through this process, we unveil transdisciplinary tensions in negotiating and perceiving the importance of visual knowledge in games research, encouraging other researchers to join us in this practice.",

      "abstract": "Cross-domain analogical reasoning is a core creative ability that can be challenging for humans. Recent work has shown some proofs-of-concept of Large language Models’ (LLMs) ability to generate cross-domain analogies. However, the reliability and potential usefulness of this capacity for augmenting human creative work has received little systematic exploration. In this paper, we systematically explore LLMs capacity to augment cross-domain analogical reasoning.  Across three studies, we found: 1) LLM-generated cross-domain analogies were frequently judged as helpful in the context of a problem reformulation task (median 4 out of 5 helpfulness rating), and frequently (~80\\% of cases) led to observable changes in problem formulations, and 2) there was an upper bound of ~25\\% of outputs bring rated as potentially harmful, with a majority due to potentially upsetting content, rather than biased or toxic content. These results demonstrate the potential utility --- and risks --- of LLMs for augmenting cross-domain analogical creativity.",

This workshop will be a temporally extended opportunity to experience the full cycle of giving and receiving gifts, whether you use our outputs or prototypes or your own ideas, artworks, or design fictions. Let's take this opportunity to use our research to celebrate and care for each other, and perhaps envision new ways of celebrating and caring for others. ",

      "abstract": "This first workshop on explainable AI for the Arts (XAIxArts) brings together a community of researchers and creative practitioners in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Interaction Design, AI, explainable AI (XAI), and Digital Arts to explore the role of XAI for the Arts. XAI is a core concern of Human-Centred AI and relies heavily on HCI techniques to explore how complex and difficult to understand AI models such as deep learning techniques can be made more understandable to people. However, XAI research has primarily focused on work-oriented and task-oriented explanations of AI and there has been little research on XAI for creative domains such as the Arts. This workshop will: i) build an XAIxArts research community; ii) map out the current and future possible landscapes of XAIxArts; iii) critically reflect on the potential of XAI for the Arts, forming the basis for an edited book on XAIxArts and an international network of researchers.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Reflection is a critical metacognitive skill that’s essential to creative discovery. As we design interactive technologies for reflection, how might we measure the impact of our designs? In this paper, we develop a coding scheme to explore reflective moments in the speech and language of young children during child-computer interaction. Using cross-disciplinary theories — from the learning sciences to cognitive neuroscience —  we define and describe 13 reflective processes occurring within Baumer’s 3 conceptual dimensions of reflection. We then use this framework to measure the impact of a child-robot storytelling interaction with twelve children ages 4–5, and offer developmentally-appropriate transcript examples for each reflective process. This coding scheme provides a practical tool for exploring the impact of our designs on early childhood reflection, and can be used to guide design iteration.",

This work explores how biophilic design (based on the theory that humans have an evolutionary desire to connect with nature) can be applied to interactive systems. We describe a generative design tool that produces a bio-inspired digital prototype of a soft robotic surface. In our workflow, participants walked outdoors to photograph natural features in their environment. The photographs are used to generate a set of corresponding designs. As early validation, we conducted a small user study to test the robustness of our tool with different photographic inputs. We also collected feedback on how the workflow influenced participants’ perceptions of the design outcomes. The results guided the fabrication of a new physical prototype and demonstrated the utility of our approach, which aims to inform the design of future biophilic cyber-physical systems. \r\n",

By highlighting a few key moments, as well as a few of my empirical, methodological, and theoretical articles, I will try to offer insights into the aspirations and exertions, the planning and serendipity, the joys and sorrows that can run through a sustained effort to explore one domain of psychological science. The research includes studies of children, college students, writers, R&D scientists, and other working adults, focusing primarily on the social psychology of creativity: the ways in which the social-psychological environment can influence creative behavior by influencing motivation, affect, and other psychological states. The talk will end with a discussion of the unexplored territory, including AI, awaiting exploration by the next generation of creativity researchers.  ",

Our team recognized a need for\r\nthoughtful urban farming systems that stimulate communal interconnectedness. Following the ACM Conference on\r\nCreativity and Cognition’s theme of “Organic Creative Spaces”, this proposal’s design is contrived from the temporal\r\nenvironment utilizing procedural design software such as Grasshopper and Rhino 3D. Our team prioritized the aesthetic\r\nquality of the planter system to portray the possibilities of small-scale urban farming models. Additionally, the design\r\nexplores various sustainable material applications. The reused and regenerative material selection allows for the creation of\r\nlow cost and an affordable method of farming, which extends this exploration to communities without access to fresh\r\nproduce. Overall, this proposal investigates the possibilities of parametric design to produce accessible modes of urban\r\nfarming.",

Our study is a qualitative interview study, currently conducted with students close to graduation or for those who are recently employed out of school. The technical interview process is an often stressful one for many interviewees. We seek to understand the concerns and thoughts behind the technical interview from the interviewee perspective to see the potential in how to improve the technical interview process.",

      "abstract": "Narrative story generation has gained emerging interest in the field of large language models. The present paper aims to compare stories generated by an LLM only (non-interleaved) with those generated by interleaving human-generated and LLM-generated text (interleaved). The study's hypothesis is that interleaved stories would perform better than non-interleaved stories. To verify this hypothesis, we conducted two tests with roughly 500 participants each. Participants were asked to rate stories of each type, including an overall score or preference and four facets---logical soundness, plausibility, understandability, and novelty. Our findings indicate that interleaved stories were in fact less preferred than non-interleaved stories. The result has implications for the design and implementation of our story generators. This study contributes new insights into the potential uses and restrictions of interleaved and non-interleaved systems regarding generating narrative stories, which may help to improve the performance of such story generators.

In this paper, we present gAIrden and Onion AI: two in-progress speculative concepts of future generative AI tools, their use cases, and the systems in which they exist. We analyze the designs through lenses of Environment, Data Privacy, Embodiment, and Play. This trip into the future is driven by the research question: how might generative AI tools change how we produce creativity and culture? When we return to the present, we ask ourselves, how might generative AI support positive outcomes for individuals and communities? Can we predict (and potentially mitigate) negative consequences of generative AI tools? The speculative designs purposefully engage viewers in futures thinking to reclaim conversation around the future of technology.",

However, co-design for these outcomes is challenging due to participants' limited experience with VR and unfamiliarity with self-expression and relaxation techniques. In this paper, we proposed VRelax, a virtual environment that will be designed to support stress relief through self-expression. We are using OpenBrush as a technology proof to provide participants with a self-expression VR experience before co-design sessions. Smartwatches and inertial sensors are used to collect heart rate and accelerometer data to evaluate participants' stress levels during VR experience. We hypothesize self-expressive VR experience will foster participants’ creativity in designing relaxation environments, and the multimodal data collected could identify which parts of the VR experience are more relaxing or stressful. Our findings will have implications to improve the co-design sessions by using VR as a technology proof and improve the design of VR experiences for relaxation.",

The proposed VR system includes animated visual prompts to allow users to create their own gestures for 13 different object interactions. A pilot study with two participants demonstrated that the visual prompts helped users understand expected interactions and enhanced their creativity in gesture design while maintaining an enjoyable user experience. Hand motion data and user feedback were collected and will be analyzed to provide quantitative insights into gesture efficiency and economy. This paper contributes to developing an intuitive and interactive gesture-based interface for VR and sets the foundation for future studies with more participants to gather additional gesture design ideas.",

While there are tangible benefits to online classrooms, there are significant drawbacks including a lack of opportunities for engagements and interactions between students and teachers, discrepancies between students' behaviors and teachers' expectations, and teachers' inability to identify whether students are grasping the materials. In this work, we explore existing systems for virtual classrooms that attempt to address these issues. Furthermore, inspired by the reasoning behind the success of physical classrooms, we provide suggestions for future virtual classrooms for increasing engagement and interactivity in online classrooms.

      "abstract": "Packaging design has witnessed an impressive transformation with the rise of computer-aided design (CAD) and computer numerical control (CNC) machines. Like many CNC-reliant practices there is an inherent cost to working through the CAD-CAM workflow especially when fit and measurement are involved. Although quick to generate prototypes, the workflow is also quick to consume materials leading to unsustainable design practices. Here, we present a more sustainable packaging design process through Proto-Pack, a CAD toolkit for procedurally generating modular, reusable, and re-configurable packaging building blocks that increase a prototype’s lifespan and utility. We show how Proto-Pack can be used to enable a sustainable workflow that reduces design footprints, supports creativity by thinking through doing and encourages reuse of materials.",

Yet, designers often get fixated on specific problems, solutions, or trivial surface details without considering the bigger system and the intricate relationships within. Previous works demonstrated how suggesting relevant design examples can help designers break out of fixation. However, current systems recommend design ideas that are decontextualized from other relevant design information. As a result, designers need to manually maintain key relationships and context during the design process. DesignNet is a system to explicitly model the inter-relationships between design information with a knowledge graph. Future work will investigate whether and how a knowledge graph representation and associated graph algorithms can support computational creativity and guide design exploration.",

We conducted an ethnography in a home studio, gathering three hours of video recordings over four consecutive days of a pro-amateur performer-producer duo during the writing of their debut album. Focusing on how performers and producers structure their interaction around the audio playback of the DAW whilst composing, this paper analyses how their relationship to the software might change their interactions, towards establishing common ground in conversation. Field notes are analysed, and a design brief is suggested where control of the playhead is given to the performer, potentially allowing them to use the audio playback within their utterances to help reference specific audio sections, even when they are not near to the DAW.

      "abstract": "Data visualization literacy (DVL) is increasingly important in navigating today's world. Young students are now required to be familiar and comfortable with data visualization skills (e.g., identifying patterns, collecting, organizing, and analyzing data). Past work focuses on cultivating children’s DVL through playful and gamified approaches. However, these past solutions require hardware (e.g., smartphones) that is not readily replicable within standard classrooms. In addition, the extent of embodied interactions found in past solutions is fairly limited to large-scale interfaces. To address these challenges, we explore how to cultivate children’s DVL through embodied learning in a classroom environment. Using a standard Google Chromebook, we designed an interface that utilizes the tracking of a CV Marker on a wooden arrow to allow a student to author their own bar graphs. We conducted Wizard of Oz testings to gather feedback on the functionality of our design. This project aims to display the benefits of giving students a mode to develop their own visualizations and broaden how they can interact with data.",

It investigates the process of generating large volumes of parts and proposes selection criteria for the script outputs through the process of mapping the form of space to its use. This process allows the resulting forms to be further modified to respond to the desired function as well as be combined with other forms. The selected objects were evaluated through the kit-of-parts approach and incorporated the assemblage principles to create a sample arrangement at a building scale. As the final output, this project focuses on reimagining an offshore oil\r\nplatform in the context of industrial heritage and its relationship with the natural environment upon decommission. Through nature, technology, and community engagement with public spaces, the industrial site will be transformed into a space of encounter and productive coexistence.",

      "abstract": "Cro-Create is a crochet gesture recognition sonifier for individual and collaborative use. In single user mode, Cro-Create directly scales and maps numerical palm orientation values detected by a motion sensor to sound. In dual user mode, the system affords users with additional auditory feedback by detecting when two users' gestures are synchronized by segmenting the gestural procedure of making a stitch in crochet into three stages and utilizing a dynamic time warping algorithm to classify and recognize these stages; when the system determines that both users have produced the same gesture, the sonification is complemented by a distinguishable chord. Through this demonstration we introduce our tool to share procedural state for the physical craftmaking process, crochet, through sound.",

      "abstract": "We introduce an interactive tool called \"Browsing the Latent Space\" (BLS), which explores the potential of latent space visualization and interpolation in 3D generative systems for design space exploration. By visualizing and interpreting the abstract space in which the outputs produced by generative systems operate (the latent space), users gain a better understanding of how the model generates its outputs, and can explore underlying patterns and structures in the data. Using the GET3D generative model, this demonstration showcases how latent space manipulation can enhance the creative process and provides an intuitive and interactive way to explore, remix, and create new chair designs. Allowing interaction with and manipulation of the generative system’s outputs in real-time, this tool supports increased awareness of the latent space as a resource for a designer’s understanding of generative systems and creative exploration.",

Selecting the right analogical leads is crucial, as it determines the quality and effectiveness of the generated ideas. However, identifying relevant analogical leads can be challenging and may be missed due to premature rejection or design fixation. To address this problem, our system, \"AnalogiLead\", draws on the cognitive mechanisms of chunking and recombination as a medium of interaction for selecting beneficial analogies. Users interact with meaningful chunks or segments from a design problem and analogy, represented as interactive tiles called \"magnets\", and evaluate the analogies by recombining the \"magnets\" into brainstorming questions. These mechanisms are designed to foster playful and divergent exploration of analogical leads (vs. restrictive, relevance-based screening), to reduce premature rejection of analogical leads and foster more analogical innovations.",

However, it is often challenging, even for professional designers, to exhaustively consider the many pitfalls that might result from design activity. We present CausalMapper, a mixed-initiative system, that leverages a large language model (LLM) and a causal map representation to teach design students how to reason about the relationships between problems and solutions. Where creativity support tools often focus on ideating creative solutions, our mixed-initiative approach focuses on ideating ecosystems of solutions that holistically address a set of related problems. By leveraging the generative creativity of LLMs, designers are inspired to consider  solutions and potential consequences that emerge when solutions are adopted. At the same time, leveraging the designers' domain knowledge to account for and correct the biases inherent in LLMs. Through a case study, we demonstrate the functionality of this mixed-initiative system. The goal of this demo is to present a creativity support tool that is intended to teach design students to think more systematically by generating ideas that challenge their thinking rather just augmenting their creative potential.",

This cognitive trait is not limited to the arts but also extends to the development of auditory interfaces for everyday products. However, uncertainties still exist regarding the current theoretical framework to move beyond abstract concepts and towards practical design methodologies. To address this issue, my doctoral research focuses on exploring a method for sound production that employs tonal music theories, creating an accessible and explainable system for auditory interface design. This approach will result in a systematic methodology covering sound progression that can respond to user scenarios, allowing designers and researchers to better describe their design and analysis. Ultimately, this research aims to enhance the end-user experience by making sound design more accessible to a broader people, opening the door to diverse and logical sound creation.",

To this day the Russian arctic urban realm lacks sensitive adaptation and responsive mechanisms, which would naturally occur under long period of gradual adaptation. In our concept the notion of organic architecture unfolds in the process of the urban environment’s adaptation to the Arctic city’s space. The main idea is that this adaptation concerns all levels of the space — natural conditions as well as social, cultural and psychological. Such a complex analysis makes it possible to achieve a true organic and sensitive fusion of artificial space together with the natural, social and individual ones. The Warm City concept is a PhD research project aimed to elaborate a theoretical model of architectural spatial formation of the built environment of the Russian Arctic city.",

      "abstract": "Creativity Support Tools (CSTs) have grown exponentially in the HCI field. However, this growth has always leaned towards divergent thinking, thus neglecting convergent thinking. We confirm this information based on a preliminary review between 2012 and 2022 in the ACM Digital Library. Our findings confirm that researchers and practitioners have been primarily interested in developing tools to support idea generation, minimizing studies on evaluating and selecting ideas. We focused our research on four major points: i) the domain of the tool, ii) the type of system and interface developed in the tools, iii) the methodology used, and iv) the creative context of the tools. Based on this information, we contribute six guidelines to support the improvement of existing CSTs and the development of new CSTs.",

      "abstract": "Neither Here, Nor There is an installation exploring human perception of the natural world from the perspective of four plants. Probing the act of communication as well as the indeterminate gap between what is deemed human and non-human, the installation highlights the complex role that technology plays in our current understanding of the human. Standing in large pots around a meeting table, plants engage in a free roaming discussion about what they think it means to be human and about planetary politics. Key questions and terms are fed into GPT-3 (AI-based natural language text generator) and played as plant sounds. As the plants converse in this manner, no aspect of their conversation is intuitively legible to the viewer. Viewers are invited to use a decoding app on their cell phone that translates these plant sounds. In avoiding an obvious mode of human-centric representation, the installation places the viewer in unknown territory, asking them to consider what intelligence, communication, and cognition mean beyond the human perspective.",

      "abstract": "AI is rapidly becoming enmeshed in our professional and private lives. The ubiquity of such technologies raises a host of ethical questions, value clashes, and unforeseen consequences that must be confronted. Developments such as Ai-Da and DALL-E 2 are exciting in that they present robust new capabilities in AI and creativity. However, the futures such technologies unlock are also unpredictable. Given the speed with which such technologies are emerging and becoming adopted, the need to engage target audiences to weigh in on possible AI futures is critical. Our pilot project, Artistic Process Futures and AI, seeks to explore the role and potential implications of AI technologies with artists. In this paper, we show how participatory speculative design processes might be channeled into a public statement, or manifesto, regarding possible and preferable AI futures for supporting the artistic process, and how our workshop exposed uncertainty at the core of such deliberation.",

      "abstract": "This study explores the potential of GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, in generating human-like future scenarios to investigate each model’s ability to perceive time. The methodology combines a coding-based experiment and an expert survey. The investigation involves fine- and prompt-tuning GPT-3, prompt-tuning GPT-3.5, and few-shot prompting GPT-4 with human-made future scenarios. The models and output are quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed for differences. The expert survey invites practitioners from fields of foresight and futurology, AI, and NLP to assess whether differences in the plausibility of output can be identified. This study’s findings suggest that GPT-3 and GPT-4 generated scenarios are difficult to distinguish from human-made ones, while GPT-3.5 performed poorly. Yet none of the models can differentiate time horizons and their respective effects on the future from each other. While no one knows the shape of things to come, this lack of understanding of a core concept of life invites future investigations.",

However, research indicates that video-conferencing can hinder creative tasks that require social presence, immediacy, and equal contribution. To address these concerns, this paper advocates the use of analytical and feedback tools to minimize the negative effects of video-conferencing. Additionally, the paper examines how computer-based creative thinking training can improve divergent thinking abilities in teams. An exploratory study was conducted using a real-time visual support system that encouraged equal participation by visualizing contribution levels. The results demonstrated that the visual support system had a positive impact on creativity performance in teams during video-conferencing meetings. These findings add to the literature on digital technology's ability to support team creativity.",

We examine this within the context of the ongoing crea.visions research project, which employs AI technologies to visualize citizens' visions of the future. Our findings underscore various factors contributing to the effectiveness of assisted visualization in this setting, such as 1) the tool's dual role as both a visual and ideational aid, 2) the introduction of innovative collaborative elements like prompt engineering, 3) the enhancement of visual expression without requiring artistic skills, and 4) the facilitation of idea communication. We also recognize limitations related to the tool and the problem context such as abstract concepts. This study serves as a foundation for future research on AI-assisted image generation as a resource in creative problem-solving, laying the groundwork for the creation of increasingly effective and user-friendly tools.",

      "abstract": "Far domain analogies --- relational comparisons between topics that seem very different on the surface, such as the solar system and an atom ---  can be a powerful source of new ideas. However, people struggle to benefit from them. We explore how bridging analogies, analogies that bridge between a knowledge anchor that is familiar to the problem solver, and a target analogy, can help innovators to benefit from far domain analogies. Utilizing a breadth first search for shortest paths between concepts on Wikipedia, we identified potential bridging analogies that connect a participant's knowledge anchor to a far domain analogy. In a think aloud study, participants brainstormed on three design challenges, with only far analogies, or far analogies and bridging analogies tailored to their knowledge anchors. We observed that bridging analogies aided participants in producing more abstract solutions vs. more direct translation of the analogies in their solution.",

Teaching about theoretical underpinnings of creativity has therefore become relevant in numerous fields, from computer science to business management.  If we consider creativity as a literacy, like writing or programming, it is important that people from different backgrounds can learn about the basic creativity concepts and how these might be manifested in practice. This article presents the design rationale of The Creativity Game, a simple online game intended to teach the player about some of the very basic properties or concepts in creativity theory: exploration, value, novelty, constraints, and transformation. The Creativity Game is a prototype presented here to spark conversation about how we teach creativity theory in a tangible way.",

      "abstract": "“Roar Your Creativity” is a one-day workshop designed to teach attendees the fundamentals of VR-sketching, as well as to explore the potential of this embodied design approach in creative collaboration. Hosted by Martijn van de Wiel, an independent Dutch designer and teacher with a background in industrial and spatial design, the workshop provides attendees with a unique opportunity to explore innovative ways of designing user experiences. The workshop is intended for designers, educators, researchers and anyone interested in crafting and investigating user experiences. Attendees are guided through the process of designing interactive elements for a Natural History Museum using Gravity Sketch, which is a virtual reality tool that enables users to create 3D sketches and scenes using intuitive hand gestures and movements. Hands-on activities and collaborative sessions will provide attendees with opportunities to practice various VR visualisation techniques and put their newly acquired skills directly to use in a creative challenge. Attendees work in teams to design, prototype and test interactive experiences for visitors of a dinosaur exhibition, using Gravity Sketch as a collaborative tool and a virtual workspace. By participating in this workshop, attendees will learn how to use VR-sketching for UX design as well as contribute to ongoing experiments intended to explore novel ways to fuel creativity and identify potential new use-cases. We will be testing the hypothesis that sketching with quick, lo-fi spatial methods triggers positive cognitive effects thus encouraging a more improvisational mindset. Attendees will leave the workshop with new skills and a fresh perspective on sketching in creative collaboration. Whether you are new to VR-sketching or an experienced professional, “Roar Your Creativity” promises to be an exciting, educational and inspirational experience.",

      "abstract": "Martijn van de Wiel is an independent Dutch creative entrepreneur and design teacher with a background in Industrial and Spatial Design. Operating from his studio in The Hague, he teaches courses and runs workshops in the field of Design Sketching.\r\n\r\nThe institutions he is affiliated with include: Technical University Delft, Technical University Eindhoven, and The Hague University of Applied Science. His sketching workshops, packaged under the Design Sketching label, include design schools, corporate teams and life long learners.\r\n\r\nMartijn is on a mission to help aspiring and professional designers unlock their creative potential. He believes all humans are creative by nature, yet our risk-averse tendencies often block the ability to tap into our creativity. He is convinced that training exploratory sketching muscles is an effective way to build confidence and allow creativity to flow.\r\n\r\nThis belief has been driving him for more than two decades to share his insights with a worldwide audience. Through hands-on classes, keynote talks, and a firm online presence, Martijn keeps beating the drum for sketching as a vehicle to support thinking and stimulate the imagination.\r\n\r\nLearn by doing is not only his didactical approach in class, it’s also his own modus operandi. In close collaboration with like-minded creatives he is constantly experimenting with new interactive formats and tools for remote and on-site skill training.\r\n\r\nIn search of a solution to share content with his students, he co-founded Sketchdrive in 2014 – an online platform for sharing visual work in online classes. It is now successfully being used worldwide in online courses with image based content and hands-on assignments.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the challenges brought on by the 2020 pandemic and inspired by a new generation of online creators, Martijn started experimenting with live streaming video from his studio. Tired of serving his students on platforms incompatible with his needs, he responded with a multi-camera setup, video lights and high quality sound. This new studio setup enabled him to host his remote classes like a tv-show, professionally directing his visual content on-the-fly.\r\n\r\nThis new tv-format proved to be better at engaging participants in live sketching activities compared to the pre-pandemic method, leading him to implement his remote setup in a new post-pandemic format. Martijn is currently exploring new ways to scale up his reach and amplify his impact.",
