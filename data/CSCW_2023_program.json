      "abstract": "Social media has become a primary mode of journalism and political discourse as evidenced by recent online political movements. Platforms like YouTube, by monetizing content through advertising revenue, have fostered a new group of online political professionals, including journalists and commentators. Recently, to limit the spread of misinformation and hateful content, these platforms have begun revising their content monetization, recommendation, and removal policies. To explore the impact on creators, we present an interview based study of journalists and political commentators on YouTube. Our participants report that these policies' implementations are inadequate technically and impacting their ability to survive financially. In their view, these policies may result in the suppression of legitimate reporting and discourse that dissents from mainstream consensus. We identify potential systemic effects of these polices and develop implications for the future design of online media.",

      "abstract": "While mentorship offers many benefits, student access to mentorship is often limited. In this paper, we introduce Compass, a chat platform where industry professionals mentor large cohorts of 30+ students with the support of novel features that enable full engagement without the typical chaos of group chat. Specifically, we conceptualize conversations as composed of not only individual messages, but also multi-person conversational units that collapse large numbers of small but related conversational exchanges into single conceptual units in the main dialogue. Doing so makes it possible to preserve a coherent linear flow of conversation while also supporting non-linear conversational exchanges that can be concisely summarized computationally and built on in the main conversation. We report on design lessons learned over a year of small real-world studies culminating in a final deployment in which 2 industry professionals successfully mentored 30+ students over a 10-week period. We find that both mentors and mentees find the chat UI effective and sometimes preferable, and discuss broader implications for the design of chat UI for large group conversations.",

However, charting this gap is challenging. In the context of XAI, we argue that charting the gap improves our problem understanding, which can reflexively provide actionable insights to improve explainability. Utilizing two case studies in distinct domains, we empirically derive a framework that facilitates systematic charting of the sociotechnical gap by connecting AI guidelines in the context of XAI and elucidating how to use them to address the gap. We apply the framework to a third case in a new domain, showcasing its affordances. Finally, we discuss conceptual implications of the framework, share practical considerations in its operationalization, and offer guidance on transferring it to new contexts. By making conceptual and practical contributions to understanding the sociotechnical gap in XAI, the framework expands the XAI design space. ",

Users are not only exposed to news shared by others, but also actively share information with a diverse set of motivations. In this work, we propose five news sharing motivations based on the intrinsic and extrinsic factors found in prior literature. Through an online experiment, we further examine how a host of factors, including motivations, influence participants’ decision to share news online. We then prompt participants to switch their original decision for extra compensation, observing how different news types, motivational and demographic factors may affect the switch. Our analysis suggests that sharing decisions can be reversed when a strong external stimulus (higher bonus) is presented. Further, there are motivational factors that independently influence participants’ reversal decisions. Finally, using our work as an empirical basis, we propose designs for future new sharing systems.",

Our research extends this body of work to identify caregivers as key decision-makers and boundary actors in mobilizing and managing care. We draw on qualitative data collected via 20 semi-structured interviews to examine caregiving responsibilities in physical and remote care interactions within households in urban India. Our findings demonstrate the crucial intermediating roles family caregivers take on while situated along the boundaries separating healthcare professionals, patients and other household members, and online/offline communities. We propose design recommendations for supporting caregivers in intermediating patient-centered care, such as through training content and expert feedback mechanisms for remote care, collaborative tracking mechanisms integrating patient- and caregiver-generated health data, and caregiving-centered online health communities. We conclude by arguing for recognizing caregivers as critical stakeholders in patient-centered care who might constitute technologically assisted pathways to care.",

      "abstract": "Volunteer moderators have the power to shape society through their influence on online discourse. However, the growing scale of online interactions increasingly provides significant hurdles for meaningful moderation. Further, limited tools exist to assist volunteers with their work. With our work, we aim to meaningfully explore the potential of AI-driven, automated moderation tools for social media to assist volunteer moderators. One key aspect is to investigate to which degree tools must become personalizable and context-sensitive to not just delete unsavory content and ban trolls, but to adapt to the millions of online communities on social media mega-platforms that rely on volunteer moderation. In this paper, we conduct semi-structured interviews with 26 Facebook Group moderators in order to better understand moderation tasks and their associated challenges. Through qualitative analysis of the interview data, we identify and address the most pressing themes in the challenges they face daily. Using interview insights, we conceptualize three tools with automated features that assist in their most challenging tasks and problems. We then evaluate the tools for usability and acceptance using an adapted TAM survey with 22 of the same moderators. Qualitative and descriptive analyses of the survey data show that context-sensitive, agency-maintaining tools in addition to trial experience are key to mass-adoption by volunteer moderators in order to build trust in the validity of the moderation technology.",

      "abstract": "Mobile payment systems have become an infrastructural component in citizens' socio-economic life in China. The rapid shift to a cashless society demands vendors of all ages to quickly adapt themselves to the ubiquitous mobile payment era. However, how this trend may impact senior vendors, a group that typically uses less technology, remains unknown despite its significance in inclusive mobile payment design. This work aims to address this gap by investigating the challenges and strategies of senior vendors in mobile payment adoption. Particularly, we focus on a traditional low-resource setting with a large volume of senior vendors: street vending. We conduct a qualitative study incorporating field observations on 33 senior street vendors and semi-structured interviews with 15 of them (aged 53-78), and take Moneywork as an analytical lens to unpack their challenges in physical and social interactions. We find that senior street vendors are a group passively adopting mobile payments due to business requirements instead of recognizing their advantages. Vendors with relatively low digital literacy have to take an alternative method - using family members' QR codes - to run the business as family-dependent money receivers. With limited considerations for senior vendors' situational vulnerabilities, unexpected difficulties of payment confirmation emerge during transactions, such as reduced confirmation efficacy under noisy surroundings and degraded hearing. Transaction security issues also appear when mobile payment-based frauds target both confirmation interfaces (e.g., fake sounds of successful payment) and trust systems (e.g., showing half-done proof to flee without paying) in street vending. Finally, we raise a less visible yet critical concern of family-dependent vendors on the lost money freedom when their income flows into their families' wallets. We propose design implications for mobile payment systems to support more secure, efficient and accessible money collection services to underrepresented groups.\r\n",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the popularity of AI-enabled conversational agents or chatbots has risen as an alternative to traditional online surveys to elicit information from people. However, there is a gap in using single-agent chatbots to converse and gather multi-faceted information across a wide variety of topics. Prior works suggest that single-agent chatbots struggle to understand user intentions and interpret human language during a multi-faceted conversation. In this work, we investigated how multi-agent chatbot systems can be utilized to conduct a multi-faceted conversation across multiple domains. To that end, we conducted a Wizard of Oz study to investigate the design of a multi-agent chatbot for gathering public input across multiple high-level domains and their associated topics. Next, we designed, developed, and evaluated CommunityBots --- a multi-agent chatbot platform where each chatbot handles a different domain individually. To manage conversation across multiple topics and chatbots, we proposed a novel Conversation and Topic Management (CTM) mechanism that handles topic-switching and chatbot-switching based on user responses and intentions. We conducted a between-subject study comparing CommunityBots to a single-agent chatbot baseline with 96 crowd workers. The results from our evaluation demonstrate that CommunityBots participants were significantly more engaged, provided higher quality responses, and experienced fewer conversation interruptions while conversing with multiple different chatbots in the same session. We also found that the visual cues integrated with the interface helped the participants better understand the functionalities of the CTM mechanism, which enabled them to perceive changes in textual conversation, leading to better user satisfaction. Based on the empirical insights from our study, we discuss future research avenues for multi-agent chatbot design and its application for rich information elicitation.",

      "abstract": "Disruption to routines is an increasingly common part of everyday life. With the roots of some disruptions in the interconnectedness of the world and environmental and socio-political instability, there is good reason to believe that conditions that cause widespread disruption will persist. Individuals, communities, and systems are thus challenged to engage in resilience practices to deal with both acute and chronic disruption. Our interest is in chronic, everyday resilience, and the role of both technology and non-technical adaptation practices engaged by individuals and communities, with a specific focus on practices centered in nature. Foregrounding nature’s role allows close examination of environmental adversity and nature as part of adaptivity. We add to the CSCW and HCI literature on resilience by examining long-distance hikers, for whom both the sources of adversity and the mitigating resilience processes cut across the social, the technical, and the environmental. In interviews with 12 long-distance hikers we find resilience practices that draw upon technology, writ large, and nature in novel assemblages, and leverage fluid configurations of the individual and the community. We place our findings in the context of a definition for resilience that emphasizes a systems view at multiple scales of social organization. We make three primary contributions: (1) we contribute an empirical account of resilience in a contextual setting that complements prior CSCW resilience studies, (2) we add nuance to existing models for resilience to reflect the role of technology as both a resilience tool and a source of adversity, and (3) we identify the need for new designs that integrate nature into systems as a way to foster collaborative resilience. This nuanced understanding of the role of technology in individual and community resilience in and with nature provides direction for technology design that may be useful for everyday disrupted life",

      "abstract": "Understanding and comparing the evolution of public opinions on a social media event is important. However, such a task requires summarizing rich semantic information and an in-depth comparison of semantics and dynamics at the same time, which is difficult for the analysis. To tackle these challenges, we propose ContextWing, an interactive visual analytics system to support pair-wise comparison for evolving sequential patterns of contexts between two data streams. The computational model of ContextWing generates dynamic topics and sequential patterns, and characterizes public attention and pair-wise correlations. A novel multi- layer bilateral wing metaphor is designed to intuitively visualizes sequential patterns merged by different contexts to reveal the similarities and differences in both temporal and semantic aspects between two streams. Interactive tools support the selection of a central keyword and its contexts to iteratively generate patterns for a focused exploration. The system supports analysis on both static and streaming settings that enables a wider range of application scenarios. We verify the effectiveness and usability of ContextWing from multiple facets, including three case studies, two expert interviews, and a user study.\r\n\r\n",

      "abstract": "The question of how to develop and maintain appropriate, socially informed and sophisticated infrastructural systems is an ongoing concern for CSCW. Information infrastructure development efforts are usually large endeavors that involve many stakeholders, including several organizations that need to interoperate with legacy systems. Projects typically take several years to develop. The duration, variety, and sites of engagement in the development of information infrastructures can be challenging to approach with typical CSCW approaches. In this paper, we compare and analyze our varied experiences in order to generate lessons learned based on being embedded for three or more years as action researchers and ethnographers in infrastructure development projects in the domains of traffic engineering, vocational education, and ocean science. Drawing upon these experiences, as well as literature in infrastructure studies, design methodologies, and organizational studies, we extract guidance for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand and engage in long-term organizationally complex system development projects. Among these lessons, we encourage revisiting previously gathered data as scope and scale change, observing changes in the discursive \"reference public\" who will benefit from the system, and planning for different intellectual points of entry and exit. This paper lays groundwork for future developments in theory and method of collaborative design and development in and with complex systems.",

      "abstract": "This paper examines the rapid introduction of AI and automation technologies within essential industries amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on participant observation and interviews within two sites of waste labor in the United States, we consider the substantial effort performed by frontline workers who smooth the relationship between robotics and their social and material environment. Over the course of the research, we found workers engaged in continuous acts of calibration, troubleshooting, and repair required to support AI technologies over time. In interrogating these sites, we develop the concept of \"patchwork\": human labor that occurs in the space between what AI purports to do and what it actually accomplishes. We argue that it is necessary to consider the often-undervalued frontline work that makes up for AI's shortcomings during implementation, particularly as CSCW increasingly turns to discussions of Human-AI collaboration.",

      "abstract": "Since the move away from integrated value chains in production in the 1980s, the outsourcing and offshoring of various aspects of manufacturing has become commonplace. This has led to global production and marketing relationships between enterprises in numerous different countries, a prominent axis being between Europe and Asia. This paper reports on a study of one such offshoring relationship between a German SME (Small and Medium Enterprise) and their Chinese subsidiary, the trials and tribulations of the collaboration between them, and the implications of this for our understanding of how articulation work might be best supported in the context of global production. We also look at how a separate entity, which we term an ‘articulation hub’, was established to support articulation between the sites. While a number of studies have looked at articulation work in Global Software Development (GSD), there are very few ethnographic studies of offshored manufacturing, despite the unique challenges it presents. We find here that issues arise not only because of differences in technology environments, infrastructures, and cultural expectations, but also because of differing development strategies and business philosophies. The core problem confronting articulation work in offshored production is the difficulty of arriving at a mutually-grounded intersubjectivity, where shared assumptions about working practices and their relative importance and value can be trusted to apply, leading to what we term ‘intersubjectivity disjunctures’. These disjunctures have a number of important implications for accomplishing articulation work. This paper offers a number of contributions to CSCW. First, it adds to a very thin corpus of CSCW-relevant ethnographic studies of global manufacturing. Second, it finds that articulation work in offshored production is less closely-coupled than it is in other distributed settings, making conventionally promoted solutions, such as knowledge sharing and relationship building, less relevant. Third, it reveals how differences in moral reasoning can result in different sites assigning very different priorities to articulation work. Finally, while articulation work is typically seen to be invisible work in CSCW, we argue that, in this context, there are a number of ways in which using a separate hub to actively render articulation work visible may be the best solution.",

      "abstract": "Social media platforms are being utilized by individuals with mental illness for engaging in self-disclosure, finding support, or navigating treatment journeys. Individuals also increasingly bring their social media data to psychotherapy consultations. This emerging practice during psychotherapy can help us to better understand how patients appropriate social media technologies to develop and iterate patient narratives – the stories of patients’ own experiences that are vital in mental health treatment. In this paper, we seek to understand patients’ perspectives regarding why and how they bring up their social media activities during psychotherapy consultations as well as related concerns. Through interviews with 18 mood disorder patients, we found that social media helps augment narratives around interpersonal conflicts, digital detox, and self-expression. We also found that discussion of social media activities shines a light on the power imbalance and privacy concerns regarding use of patient-generated health information. Based on the findings, we discuss that social media data are different from other types of patient-generated health data in terms of supporting patient narratives because of the social interactions and curation social media inherently engenders. We also discuss privacy concerns and trust between a patient and a therapist when patient narratives are supported by patients’ social media data. Finally, we suggest design implications for social computing technologies that can foster patient narratives rooted in social media activities.",

      "abstract": "Benefits of learning by teaching (LbT) have been highlighted by previous studies from a pedagogical lens, as well as through computer-supported systems. However, the challenges that university students face in technology-mediated LbT---whether it be teaching oneself, teaching a peer, or teaching an agent---is not well understood. Furthermore, there is a gap in knowledge on the challenges that students encounter throughout the process of teaching (content selection, preparation, teaching, receiving and giving feedback, and reflection) despite its importance to the design of LbT platforms. Thus, we conducted a study with 24 university students where they taught content they had not fully grasped, without guidance, and participated in a semi-structured interview. Results demonstrate that participants encountered the following challenges: psychological barriers relating to self and others, and lack of know-how. Furthermore, we illuminate design implications required to overcome these challenges and benefit from LbT without requiring prior training in pedagogy.",

      "abstract": "Discussions about polarizing topics are essential to have, yet they can easily become hostile, aggressive, or distressing on current social media platforms. Content moderation interventions aim to mitigate this issue, though such approaches are reactionary, removing harmful content only after it has been posted. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment with 40 participants to investigate how a design friction that manipulates the temporal flow during a contentious conversation can foster interpersonal mindfulness, a trait critical for productive communication. Dyads were randomly assigned into the Control Group which received no intervention, and the Experiment Group where participants were limited to sending one message per two-minute interval. Triangulating quantitative and qualitative data from conversation logs, questionnaires, interviews, and computational text analysis, our findings revealed a two-fold effect: Experiment Group participants felt simultaneously frustrated by the intervention as it disrupted the pacing of their conversation and interfered with rapport-building, and appreciative of the intervention as it nudged them towards writing more thoughtful and task-focused messages. We discuss implications of these findings for future investigation into the design of temporal interventions to influence interpersonal mindfulness during contentious online discussions.",

We describe how volunteers transitioned the UK’s long-established Oxjam grassroots music festival online in response to the COVID pandemic, delivering a local pilot before scaling up nationwide. We adopt an infrastructural perspective to reveal how two teams of volunteers defined a flexible festival format, knitted together diverse technologies into a technical platform, and operated this to deliver the festival. We highlight the need for teams of volunteers to orchestrate both audience and performer trajectories through festivals. We argue for deliberately designing in volunteer labour rather than automating it out by translating traditional roles online while defining new digital ones. We propose to make these roles rewarding through a more social volunteer experience, including privileged backstage access. We highlight the challenges of using social media for such events, including complying with algorithmic policing of rights.",

      "abstract": "Visualizations play a considerable role in explaining trends or providing evidence when consuming data online. Whether those visualizations are shared on news outlets or social networks, platforms usually allow readers to discuss their stories in comments sections. For the scope of this work, we studied the online community r/dataisbeautiful on Reddit. We found that chart creators used various authoring tools to share their content. Readers of these posts, commenters, used text mainly to discuss and critique the visual content. We noticed a need for a richer mode of communication that would show instead of telling authors what to do. Based on our findings, we introduced Vizdat, a lightweight tool, and extension to allow users to visualize and reproduce charts in the comments sections of data stories. We used Vizdat as a technology probe with 11 Reddit users to create data visualization and discuss charts on r/dataisbeautiful. During the four-week field deployment period, we observed how Vizdat was used and interviewed the participants. We found that commenters saw value in accessing the visualization specifications through Vizdat and used those charts to structure their replies with richer modalities. As a result, visualization authors appreciated the feedback and less toxic discussion through comments embedded with modified versions of their charts. In our paper, we share these findings and other insights to understand the dynamics of forum discussion around charts.",

      "abstract": "Vulnerability intimately shapes the lived human experience and continues to gain attention in computer-supported cooperative work and human-computer interaction scholarship broadly, and in social media studies specifically. Social media comprise sociotechnical affordances that may uniquely shape lived experiences with vulnerability, rendering existing frameworks inadequate for comprehensive examinations of vulnerability as mediated on social media. Through interviews with social media users in the United States (N = 20) and drawing on feminist conceptualizations of vulnerability and social media disclosure and privacy scholarship, we propose a feminist taxonomy of social media vulnerability (FSMV). The FSMV taxonomy reflects vulnerability sources, states, and valences, within which we introduce the state of networked vulnerability and ambivalent, desired, and undesired valences. We describe how social media enable forms of vulnerability different from in-person settings, challenge framings that synonymize vulnerability with risk/harm, and facilitate interdisciplinary theory-building. Additionally, we discuss how networked, ambivalent, and un/desired vulnerability extend and diverge from prior work to create a theoretically rich taxonomy that is useful for future work on social media and vulnerability. Finally, we discuss implications for design related to granular control over profile, content, and privacy settings, as well as implications for platform accountability, as they pertain to social media vulnerability.",

      "abstract": "Phishing attacks, in which deceptive messages purporting to be from a legitimate contact are used to trick recipients and acquire sensitive information for the purposes of committing fraud, are a substantial and growing problem for organizations. IT departments and professionals may put in place a variety of institutional responses to thwart such attacks, but an organization’s susceptibility to phishing also depends on the decisions and actions of individual employees. These employees may have little phishing expertise but still need to react to such attempts on a daily basis. Based on 24 semi-structured interviews with mid-career office workers (70.8% women, averaging 44 years old, with a bachelor’s degree or more) at two universities in the midwestern United States, we find that employees self-describe a wide range of levels of awareness of, and confidence, competency and investment in, the organization’s proscribed anti-phishing policies and practices.  These employees also describe variation in the ways they would prefer to increase their perceived performance levels in all of these areas. In this paper, we argue that in order to empower employees to be better collaborators in an organization’s anti-phishing efforts, organizations should embrace a range of efforts akin to the range of expertise among the users themselves. We make four such empowering recommendations for organizations to consider incorporating into their existing anti-phishing policies and practices, including suggestions to 1) embrace educating non-expert users more fully on organizational processes and consequences, 2) provide employees with a standing one-to-one communication channel between them and an IT phishing point-of-contact, 3) keep employees in the loop once phishing reports are made, and 4) avoid testing employees with \"gotcha\" assessments.",

      "abstract": "Much emphasis has been placed on how the affordances and layouts of office settings can influence coworker interactions and perceived team outcomes. Little is known, however, whether perceptions of teamwork and team conflict are affected when the location of work changes from the office to the home. To address this gap, we present findings from a ten-week, \\textit{in situ} study of 91 information workers from 27 US-based teams. We compare three distinct work locations---private and shared workspaces at home as well at the office---and explore how each setting may impact individual perceptions of teamwork. While there was no significant association of work location with perceptions of teamwork, results revealed associations with team conflict: participants who worked in a private room at home reported significantly lower team conflict compared to those working in the office. No difference was found for the office and the shared workspace. We further found that the influence of work location on team conflict interacted with job decision latitude and the level of task interdependence among coworkers. We discuss practical implications for full-time work from home (WFH) on teams. Our study adds an important environmental dimension to the literature on remote teaming, which in turn may help organizations as they consider, prepare, or implement more permanent WFH and/or hybrid work policies in the future.",

We present the results of a survey of voice assistant users (n=1314) measuring trust, security, and privacy perceptions of voice assistants with varying levels of online functionality explained in different ways. We then asked participants to re-explain how these voice assistants worked, showing that while privacy explanations relieved privacy concerns, trust concerns were exacerbated by trust explanations. Participants' trust, privacy, and security perceptions also distinguished between first party online functionality from the voice assistant vendor and third party online functionality from other developers, and trust in vendors appeared to operate independently from device explanations. Our findings point to the use of analogies to guide users, targeting trust and privacy concerns, key improvements required from manufacturers, and implications for competition in the sector.",

      "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have developed contact-tracing technologies to curb the spread of the disease by locating and isolating people who have been in contact with coronavirus carriers. Subsequently, understanding why people install and use contact tracing applications is becoming central to their effectiveness and impact. This paper analyzes how involuntary systems can crowd out voluntary participation in data collection systems. To do so, we analyze the simultaneous deployment of two contact-tracing technologies in Israel: centralized mass surveillance technologies and a voluntary contact-tracing mobile app. Based on a representative survey of Israelis (n=519), our findings show that positive attitudes toward mass surveillance were related to a reduced likelihood of installing contact tracing apps and an increased likelihood of uninstalling them. These results also hold when controlling for privacy concerns, attitudes toward the app, trust in authorities, and demographic properties. We discuss the impact of these findings on the overall effectiveness of COVID-19 contact tracing and suggest a framework for thinking about crowding out effects in systems that combine involuntary surveillance and voluntary participation.\r\n",

      "abstract": "The acquisition of information and its use in decision making and coping by people with health concerns have garnered much attention in CSCW. This study investigated patients’ information behavior during a critical treatment, in vitro fertilization (IVF). Based on in-depth interviews with 29 IVF patients, this study uncovered several underlying drivers and mechanisms accounting for patients’ information behavior. Their behavior is shown to be driven by coping concerns – specifically, dealing with the unpredictability of the treatment outcome, overcoming feelings of powerlessness and the sense of being out of control, and managing difficult emotionality. These factors shape patients’ information needs and drive their behaviors in seemingly irrational but ultimately logical and adaptive ways. In contrast to the conventional wisdom that patients typically seek information that can help them fill knowledge gaps to resolve treatment uncertainty and foster their positive emotions, we discovered that in response to the desire to control their perceptions of irresolvable uncertainty and the difficult emotional needs of the moment, IVF patients frequently used “calibrated uncertainty” – a psychological mechanism or state driven by the simultaneous seeking of varying levels and contradictory valences of certainty – to actively conduct targeted searches and actively use the information sought. This behavior has not always been understood by the IVF clinicians, who have assumed that information was primarily for knowledge transfer. This study shows that coping, emotion regulation, and information-seeking are inextricably bound together in the patient experience, and that this intertwining must be considered in the clinical setting for physician-patient communication and for patient-facing information. The findings have several valuable design implications for improved health informatics technology and service delivery systems. ",

      "abstract": "Computer vision is a \"data hungry\" field. Researchers and practitioners who work on human-centric computer vision, like facial recognition, emphasize the necessity of vast amounts of data for more robust and accurate models. Humans are seen as a data resource which can be converted into datasets. The necessity of data has led to a proliferation of gathering data from easily available sources, including \"public\" data from the web. Yet the use of public data has significant ethical implications for the human subjects in datasets. We bridge academic conversations on the ethics of using publicly obtained data with concerns about privacy and agency associated with computer vision applications. Specifically, we examine how practices of dataset construction from public data—not only from websites, but also from public settings and public records—make it extremely difficult for human subjects to trace their images as they are collected, converted into datasets, distributed for use, and, in some cases, retracted. We discuss two interconnected barriers current data practices present to providing an ethics of traceability for human subjects: awareness and control. We conclude with key intervention points for enabling traceability for data subjects. We also offer suggestions for an improved ethics of traceability to enable both awareness and control for individual subjects in dataset curation practices.\r\n",

      "abstract": "The emerging uptake of AI chatbots for social support entails systematic comparisons between human and non-human entities as sources of support. In a between-subject experimental study, a human and two types of ostensible chatbots (using a wizard of oz design) had supportive conversations with college students who were experiencing stressful situations during the pandemic. We found that when compared with a less ideal chatbot (i.e., low-contingent chatbot), (1) the human support provider was perceived with more warmth, which directly reduced emotional distress among participants; (2) the ideal chatbot (i.e., high-contingent chatbot) was perceived to be more competent, which activated participants’ cognitive reappraisal of their stressful situations and subsequently reduced emotional distress. The human provider and the ideal chatbot did not differ in users’ perceived competence or warmth, although the human provider was more effective at activating participants’ cognitive reappraisal. This study integrates human communication theories into human-computer interaction work and contributes by positioning and theorizing user perceptions of chatbots in a larger process from support sources with varying communication competence to users’ cognitive and emotional responses, and ultimately to the distress outcome. Theoretical and design implications are discussed. ",

      "abstract": "Navigation assistance systems (NASs) aim to help visually impaired people (VIPs) navigate unfamiliar environments. Most of today’s NASs support VIPs via turn-by-turn navigation, but a growing body of work highlights the importance of exploration as well. It is unclear, however, how NASs should be designed to help VIPs explore unfamiliar environments. In this paper, we perform a qualitative study to understand VIPs' information needs and challenges with respect to exploring unfamiliar environments, with the aim of informing the design of NASs that support exploration. Our findings reveal the types of spatial information that VIPs need as well as factors that affect VIPs' information preferences. We also discover specific challenges that VIPs face that future NASs can address such as orientation and mobility education and collaborating effectively with others. We present design implications for NASs that support exploration, and we identify specific research opportunities and discuss open socio-technical challenges for making such NASs possible. We conclude by reflecting on our study procedure to inform future approaches in research on ethical considerations that may adopted while interacting with the broader VIP community.",

In previous research, cue exposure and biofeedback technologies proved effective in drug psychotherapy sessions; however, the focus has generally been on the awareness of cravings and the identification of cues. There has been relatively little research on methods aimed at facilitating therapist-patient communication, particularly from a user-centered perspective. In this paper, we describe a qualitative technology probe study exploring the means by which patients identify cues and perceive cravings as well as the way that they communicate with therapists. Our analysis considers the difficulties in cue identification and craving perception, the interactions between the two, and the means by which these characteristics could impact the design of VR support systems in the future.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 individuals who play critical roles in the data work of 18 different advocacy organizations. Our analysis reveals five key stakeholders in advocacy data work---beneficiaries, policymakers, funding and partner organizations, gatekeepers, and local publics. It also contributes a framework of four functions of data work in nonprofit organizations---data as amplifier, activator, legitimizer, and incubator. We characterize the challenges in data work that exist, particularly in widespread attempts to reappropriate data work across functions. These challenges in reappropriation are often rooted in participants' effects to enact data feminist principles from the margins of the data economy. Finally, we discuss how nonprofit institutions operate outside of the dominant data work goals known as the three Ss (surveillance, selling, and science) and propose a fourth S, social good, that is working to challenge the norms of the data economy and should be considered in research  regarding the data economy moving forward.

      "abstract": "Collaboration comes in many forms. How \\textit{relevant stakeholders} collaborate at the scale of a system deserves scholarly attention because their practices may differ from traditional teams like dyads or small groups. This study investigates how stakeholders of a local produce supply-and-demand system, namely experts, farmers, sellers, and consumers, in Taiwan collaborate and communicate for information as a case to illustrate how they depend on one another for information collaboration in the system. Using qualitative in-depth interview, we found that stakeholders had diverse collaboration goals within the system and encountered challenges in acquiring information from one another. In addition to establishing a holistic understanding of stakeholders' individual and collective practices in the system of produce supply-and-demand, we propose several design suggestions to address the needs and challenges we identified.

      "abstract": "This study explores the global phenomenon of migration at the local, neighborhood level of a mid-sized city in Germany. Focusing on a long-term interactive storytelling-initiative, it studies the emergence of Arrival Literacy as a bi-directional skill-set. It describes the development of individual, local responses to global migration consequences, among both newcomers who migrated, as well as long-term citizens who never moved. The analytic lens of Arrival Literacy brings forward the complexity and difficulties of the arrival process, where the individual is navigating the consequences of political decisions that were made at a broader level. Digital storytelling as an element is a method to 1) creatively develop a skill of expression for one’s own positionality, and 2) to connect with the positionalities of others, thus supporting the process of dealing with arrival at the local community level and beyond.",

Complex technology platforms that deal with safety-critical areas are particularly challenging, often operating within private domains (e.g. health services within the home) and used by individuals with various understandings of hardware, software, and algorithmic design. Through two studies, the first an interview and the second an observational study, we questioned how experts (e.g. those who designed, built, and installed a technology platform) supported provision of informed consent by participants. We identify a wide range of tools, techniques, and adaptations used by experts to explain the complex SPHERE sensor-based home health platform, provide implications for the design of tools to aid explanations, suggest opportunities for interactive explanations, present the range of information needed, and indicate future research possibilities in communicating technology platforms.",

      "abstract": "Online freelancing platforms, such as Upwork, hold great promise in enabling flexible work opportunities where freelancers can combine their work with other life responsibilities, hereafter work-life. However, prior research suggests that platform features and self-managing demands of freelance work can jeopardise this apparent flexibility. In this paper, we report findings from a qualitative study, combining a 14-diary and semi-structured interview with 15 Upwork freelancers. We explored online freelancers' work practices, challenges, and the impact of platform features on their everyday lives. Our qualitative data suggest that platform features and individual context shape online freelancers' work-life practices. Freelancers develop strategies to mitigate platforms' constraints and balance their individual preferences and responsibilities. Further, our findings illustrate how platform features challenge freelancers' availability expectations, work autonomy, and work detachment. This paper contributes an empirical understanding of the factors influencing online freelancers' work-life practices by drawing upon Wanda J. Orlikowski's Structuration Model of Technology. This theoretical lens renders the interplay of freelancers, platforms, and instituted norms of freelance work. ",

However, the aides’ work is often unrecognized by the caregiving team despite being in demand and crucial to care—an invisibility reinforced by ill-suited technological tools. In order to understand the invisible work aides perform and its relationship to technology design, we interviewed 13 aides employed by home care agencies in New York City. These aides shared examples that demonstrated the intertwined nature of both types of invisible work (i.e., emotions- and systems-based) and expanded the sociological mechanisms of invisibility (i.e., sociocultural, sociolegal, sociospatial) to include the sociotechnical. Through these findings, we investigate the opportunities, tensions, and challenges that could inform the design of tools created for these important, but often overlooked, frontline caregivers.",

      "abstract": "The 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster has led to worldwide disruptive discussions related to crisis. In April 2021, the news that the Japanese Cabinet decided to discharge the stored wastewater into the Pacific Ocean drew global attention once again. Social media platforms like Twitter are ubiquitously used to gain information and exchange opinions during and after a crisis. Analyzing crisis-related tweets can help capture insights for public situational awareness development, crisis global response coordination, and post-disaster policy-making. We examined corresponding Twitter discourse in different languages about the nuclear disaster in 2011 and the follow-up discharge of the stored water until 2021. We utilized NLP techniques including topic modeling and sentiment analysis to identify the dominant topics related to the nuclear disaster, the post-disaster discourses, and the public attitudes towards these topics in different time phases. Our work revealed multilingual disparities of post-disaster discourse dynamics and the regional public attitudes towards the post-disaster management in the long run.",

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition technologies, while critiqued for bias, validity, and privacy invasion, continue to be developed and applied in a range of domains including in high-stakes settings like the workplace. We set out to examine emotion recognition technologies proposed for use in the workplace, describing the input data and training, outputs, and actions that these systems take or prompt. We use these design features to reflect on these technologies’ implications using the ethical speculation lens. We analyzed patent applications that developed emotion recognition technologies to be used in the workplace (N=86). We found that these technologies scope data collection broadly; claim to reveal not only targets’ emotional expressions, but also their internal states; and take or prompt a wide range of actions, many of which impact workers’ employment and livelihoods. Technologies described in patent applications frequently violated existing guidelines for ethical automated emotion recognition technology. We demonstrate the utility of using patent applications for ethical speculation. In doing so, we suggest that 1) increasing the visibility of claimed emotional states has the potential to create additional emotional labor for workers (a burden that is disproportionately distributed to low-power and marginalized workers) and contribute to a larger pattern of blurring boundaries between expectations of the workplace and a worker’s autonomy, and more broadly to the data colonialism regime; 2) Emotion recognition technology’s failures can be invisible, may inappropriately influence high-stakes workplace decisions and can exacerbate inequity. We discuss the implications of making emotions and emotional data visible in the workplace and submit for consideration implications for designers of emotion recognition, employers who use them, and policymakers.

Such service is not similar to the kind of intimacy that fans and idols generate through parasocial relationships, but behaves as the direct dyadic intimacy between service providers (\\emph{virtual lovers}) and buyers (\\emph{customers}). To gain a deep understanding of computer-mediated paid companionship, we study emerging user behaviors in VRS through a mixed-method study, including a survey ($N = 178$) and a follow-up semi-structured interview ($N = 22$) with both virtual lovers and customers to learn about their motivations, perceptions, and how virtual lovers provide online paid companionship to meet customers' emotional needs. We found three behavioral strategies of virtual lovers and the fact that they provide service in surface and deep acting and real feeling. Customers also see VRS as a way to obtain affective benefits with reduced affective costs. We also found that VRS customers paid for the tangible benefits of an idealized romantic partner, rather than long-term commitment and emotional investment, and identified key characteristics that VRS reduces from intimate relationships that fit its pay-per-use feature. We conclude by discussing the nature of virtual lovers and design implications for computer-mediated paid companionship.",

      "abstract": " Americans' trust in news is declining, and authenticity and transparency challenges in digital publishing contexts pose unique challenges to the ability to effectively gratify their information-seeking needs via online media. Cryptographic technologies and web-based provenance indicators have the potential to enhance the trustworthiness and transparency of digital communication, but better understandings of news consumers practices and needs are required to develop practical tools. Through a representative online survey of 400 digital news consumers and 19 follow-up interviews, we investigate how users authenticate and assign trust to news content, and identify specific needs pertaining to news transparency and authentication that could be met by  digital news authentication tools. While many users currently rely on political ideology to assess news trustworthiness, we find that users of all political orientations see value in independent provenance and authentication tools for digital news.",

      "abstract": "Home care workers (HCWs) provide essential care in patients' homes but are often underappreciated and work in stressful and isolated environments with diverse and intersecting support needs.  This paper describes a computer-mediated peer support program that centers around sharing circles: spaces for personal, narrative storytelling to encourage HCWs to collaboratively reflect on their home care experiences and build rapport and shared identity with their peers.  We describe the design of this program and a 12-week deployment that we conducted to evaluate the program with 42 HCWs in New York City.  Our findings show that participants engaged in multiple types of peer support including emotional validation, learning how to navigate the workplace and patient care, defining and enabling good home care praxis, and building understanding around purpose and identity as HCWs.  We discuss how these findings inform the design of technology and use of holistic pedagogies, such as storytelling, to enable this support in computer-mediated peer support programs.  Such programs can help researchers and practitioners interested in addressing diverse needs that occur in intersectional contexts, such as that of HCWs and other marginalized populations.",

We investigate how the decision-making of a team member in a human-AI team impacts the outcome of the collaboration and perceived team-efficacy. In a large scale study on Mechanical Turk (n=125), we find significant differences across different decision making styles and disclosed AI identity disclosure in an AI-driven collaborative game. We find that autocratic decision-making negatively impacts team-efficacy in Human-AI teams, similar to its effects on human-only teams. We find that decision making style and AI-identity disclosure impacts how individuals make decisions in a collaborative context.

We conducted a qualitative analysis of online discourse on Twitter around the redevelopment of an old manufacturing district in Seoul, South Korea, and investigated how the place-based nature of the contested situation complicated the process of public mobilization. We found that the collective meaning-making based on individuals' existing relationships to a contested place led the citizens who were neither the tenants nor property owners in the area to find the struggle relevant to their lives and to establish their agency in an effort to influence redevelopment policy. We argue that the capacity of online discourse that alters the social meaning of place and its ownership opens up an opportunity for technology to better support grassroots efforts to improve social justice in urban development and policy-making processes. Yet, the disputes we found from the online discussions revealed some limitations of online discourse in place-based activism, which led us to suggest research agendas for the CSCW community to address the limitations.",

One notable change is an increased reliance on informal chatting tools in support of both distributed and co-located work. However, while researchers have recognized the growing prominence of these tools in work, little is known about how to best support youth who have grown up with access to interconnected technologies in acquiring and practicing the relevant skills needed to effectively communicate using these tools. In this study, we studied youth’s utilization of Slack, a popular workplace chatting tool, in an after-school 3D print shop. Using in-depth semi-structured interviews, we uncovered the factors that supported or hindered youth employees’ Slack use in a technical work context. This work offers implications for how to design youth workplace communication and coordination protocols that support the needs of this population.",

      "abstract": "Wizard of Oz (WoZ) as a prototyping method has been used to simulate intelligent user interfaces, particularly for speech-based systems. However, as our societies' expectations on artificial intelligence (AI) grows, the question remains whether a single Wizard is sufficient for it to simulate smarter systems and more complex interactions. Optimistic visions of 'what artificial intelligence (AI) can do' places demands on WoZ platforms to simulate smarter systems and more complex interactions. This raises the question of whether the typical approach of employing a single Wizard is sufficient. Moreover, while existing work has employed multiple Wizards in WoZ studies, a Multi-Wizard approach has not been systematically studied in terms of feasibility, effectiveness, and challenges. We offer Wizundry, a real-time, web-based WoZ platform that allows multiple Wizards to collaboratively operate a speech-to-text based system remotely. We outline the design and technical specifications of our open-source platform, which we iterated over two design phases. We report on two studies in which participant-Wizards were tasked with negotiating how to cooperatively simulate an interface that can handle natural speech for dictation and text editing as well as other intelligent text processing tasks. We offer qualitative findings on the Multi-Wizard experience for Dyads and Triads of Wizards. Our findings reveal the promises and challenges of the Multi-Wizard approach and open up new research questions.",

      "abstract": "Accessibility efforts, how we can make the world usable and useful to as many people as possible, have explicitly focused on how we can support and allow for the autonomy and independence of people with disabilities, neurotypes, chronic conditions, and older adults. Despite these efforts, not all technology is designed or implemented to support everyone's needs. One technology that has recently been in the press for how challenging it can be for some creators to use is the short-form video sharing platform, TikTok. Recently, a community-organized push by creators and general users of TikTok urged the platform to add accessibility features, such as closed captioning to user-generated content, allowing more people to use the platform with greater ease. Our work focuses on an understudied population--people with ADHD and those who experience similar challenges--exploring the creative practices people from this community engage in, focusing on the kinds of accessibility they create through their creative work. Through an interview study exploring the experiences of creatives on TikTok, we find that creatives engage in critical infrastructuring--a process of bottom-up (re)design--to make the platform more accessible despite the challenges the platform presents to them as creators. We present these, bottom up, critical infrastructuring practices through the themes of: creating and augmenting video editing infrastructures and creating and augmenting video captioning infrastructures. We then reflect on how the introduction of a top-down infrastructure - the implementation of an auto-captioning feature - shifts the critical infrastructure practices of content creators. Through their infrastructuring, creatives were revising the broader sociotechnical capabilities of TikTok to support their own needs as well as the broader needs of the TikTok community. We discuss how the routine of infrastructuring accessibility is actually best conceptualized as incidental care work. We further highlight how accessibility is an evolving sociotechnical construct, and forward the concept of contextual accessibility.",

      "abstract": "The collection, organization, and retrieval of data about queer individuals and their identities challenge the creators and curators of highly structured database systems. While prior research in archival studies and demographics has examined processes of collecting and storing queer identities, they do not examine the complexities of highly democratized platforms that lack top-down mandates that often structure archival schemas. To examine the representation of queer people on open-platform databases, we performed a trace ethnography and thematic analysis of Wikidata, an open collaboration, highly structured database. We specifically examined the creation of, changes to, discussions around, and impacts of properties that encode queer identities, such as \\textit{sexual orientation} and \\textit{sex or gender}. We found that changes often have unexpected impacts: contributors struggled to determine vocabulary for queer identities which were accurate across the diverse cultural contexts of the Wikidata community; that the recording of queer identities could cause a stigmatizing effect for LGBT individuals, with further concerns of spreading rumors or outing closeted people, and contributors proposing changes which would cause biased representations of queer people. Our analysis demonstrates inherent and unaddressed frictions when translating queer identities to the confines of a structured database. We conclude by discussing ways that the highly bottom-up, collaborative nature of platforms such as Wikidata, often seen as a major strength, can be vulnerable to individuals or small groups derailing and filibustering changes they disagreed with on politically charged topics such as queer identities.

      "abstract": "While COVID-19 text misinformation has already been investigated by various scholars, fewer research efforts have been devoted to characterizing and understanding COVID-19 misinformation that is carried out through visuals like photographs and memes. In this paper, we present a mixed-method analysis of image-based COVID-19 misinformation in 2020 on Twitter. We deploy a computational pipeline to identify COVID-19 related tweets, download the images contained in them, and group together visually similar images. We then develop a codebook to characterize COVID-19 misinformation and manually label images as misinformation or not. Finally, we perform a quantitative analysis of tweets containing COVID-19 misinformation images. We identify five types of COVID-19 misinformation, from a wrong understanding of the threat severity of COVID-19 to the promotion of fake cures and conspiracy theories. We also find that tweets containing COVID-19 misinformation images do not receive more interactions than baseline tweets with random images posted by the same set of users. As for temporal properties, COVID-19 misinformation images are shared for longer periods of time than non-misinformation ones, as well as have longer burst times. When looking at the users sharing COVID-19 misinformation images on Twitter from the perspective of their political leanings, we find that pro-Democrat and pro-Republican users share a similar amount of tweets containing misleading or false COVID-19 images. However, the types of images that they share are different: while pro-Democrat users focus on misleading claims about the Trump administration's response to the pandemic, as well as often sharing manipulated images intended as satire, pro-Republican users often promote hydroxychloroquine, an ineffective medicine against COVID-19,  as well as conspiracy theories about the origin of the virus. Our analysis  sets a basis for better understanding COVID-19 misinformation images on social media, and reveals some characteristics of users who post COVID-19 misinformation images.",

However, a lack of traditional informational gatekeeping online has allowed for the rapid proliferation of misinformation via social media. This has been clearly evidenced within the realm of human trafficking by the spread of conspiracy theories instigated by the QAnon-led campaign #SaveTheChildren. Through in-depth interviews with members of the public and professionals involved in anti-trafficking activism we explore how individuals find trustworthy information about human trafficking in light of the public spread of misinformation. Our findings highlight the centrality of distrust as a driving force behind information-seeking on social media. Further, we highlight the tensions that arise from using social media as a primary resource within anti-trafficking education and the limitations of interventions to slow the spread of trafficking-related misinformation.

This paper aims to complicate and complement this scholarship by investigating the temporal entanglements of digital humanitarian work with refugees and asylum seekers in Turkey during COVID-19. We interviewed 22 humanitarian workers to understand their experiences and concerns as well as strategies they employed to support refugees and immigrants at a distance. The data reveal the complex temporal, informational, and infrastructural dimensions of technologically-mediated refugee support work, challenging the trope of “pivot to remote work”, as popular in western countries. Our findings contribute to the CSCW research on the theory of anticipation work and its relationship with the concept of collaborative rhythms to explicate the relational and situated aspects of the temporal experiences of humanitarian workers in low-resource settings.",

      "abstract": "Social media platforms are celebrated for their capacity to empower those with marginalized and disenfranchised identities and support them to create counterpublics. We focus on one such group, Muslim Americans, and ask how visible Muslim Americans, such as journalists, activists, and aspiring politicians, use social media to craft counter-narratives, reclaim control of their stories, and mitigate the harm directed at them. Through a series of 19 interviews, we found that visible Muslim Americans’ ability to craft and sustain counter narratives is largely hampered by sustained online harm. We found that these public figures were harmed repeatedly over long periods of time and through the weaponization of platform affordances such as replying, tagging, and hashtag takeovers, as well as their gender and identity. Our findings shed light on the serious limitations of social media to provide a safe platform for counterpublics to engage externally with wider publics. Finally, we discuss the limitations of content moderation as the dominant framework for addressing harm online and suggest alternative paths forward based on restorative and transformative justice.",

      "abstract": "Depression is the most common mental health problem in older adults; however, a lack of understanding in the interaction between physical and social causes hinders effective treatment. Unique issues such as age-specific increases in comorbid physical problems and alienation from social contact can make it difficult for health providers to identify instances of depression. These also make it difficult for depressed older adults to communicate with their social resources, such as friends, family, and health providers. Integrating technology-assisted collaboration with members of patients' social network to observe and manage multi-dimensional factors in depressed older adults' states is a potential way to improve the quality of practitioners' treatment-planning around these multi-dimensional factors, as well as provide assistance for family and friends' involvement in managing the depression. We conducted an interview study on stakeholders' perceptions of depression and communication to understand the opportunities and challenges involved in implementing such collaborative design. Interviewees included 16 depressed older adult patients, 10 of their family members, and two psychiatrists. Our findings reveal new insights into 1) patients' and families' social values and understandings of patients' condition, as well as 2) how these values and understandings influenced decision-making on communicating with each other and acting on depression. These insights have implications for the consideration of information and communication systems to aid depressed older adults' recovery and engagement with social network members.",

While the degree of success these programs have had in achieving their objectives remains open to question, one factor that has been identified as important to any success is the role of open data intermediaries, individuals and organizations that help others to make use of open data. In this paper we investigate how people become engaged with open data, what their motivations are, and the barriers and facilitators program participants perceive with regard to using open data effectively. We interview participants from a variety of backgrounds with differing levels of experience and engagement with open data.  Participants include students learning how to train others in open data techniques and tools; people who attend open data events and use open data for commercial or social benefit; and representatives from local government, municipal agencies and a civic tech non-profit. We identify pathways to successfully developing and nurturing a community of open data intermediaries, and make five recommendations for organizations planning and managing open data programs. ",

      "abstract": "Technologies are increasingly enrolled in projects to involve civilians in the work of policy-making, often under the label of `civic technology'. But conventional forms of participation through transactions such as voting provide limited opportunities for engagement. In response, some civic tech groups organize around issues of shared concern to explore new forms of democratic technologies. How does their work affect the relationship between publics and public servants?\r\n\r\nThis paper explores how a Civic Tech Toronto creates a platform for civic engagement through the maintenance of an autonomous community for civic engagement and participation that is casual, social, nonpartisan, experimental, and flexible. Based on two years of action research, including community organizing, interviews, and observations, this paper shows how this grassroots civic tech group creates a civic platform that places a diverse range of participants in contact with the work of public servants, helping to build capacities and relationships that prepare both publics and public servants for the work of participatory democracy.  \r\n\r\nThe case shows that understanding civic tech requires a lens beyond the mere analysis or production of technical artifacts. As a practice for making technologies that is social and participatory, civic tech creates alternative modes of technology development and opportunities for experimentation and learning, and it can reconfigure the roles of democratic participants.

      "abstract": "Legal crowdfunding is an emerging domain where lawyers and individuals raise funds to fight legal actions. To study how prospective donors can verify the credibility of legal campaigns, we analyzed the conversations surrounding these campaigns on Facebook. We discovered three primary themes associated with the perceptions of the contributors of legal campaigns: supporters posting admiring and appreciative comments, supporters posting critical and disapproving comments, and opponents posting critical and disapproving comments. We observed that while supporters criticized campaigns' opponents, biased media, and dishonest authorities, opponents criticized campaign owners, campaigns' objectives and opaque logistics. To understand the impact of these perspectives on donors, we followed up with an online survey study where we presented a legal campaign with its corresponding social media conversations. We found that critical comments impacted donation decisions more than appreciative comments. We concluded with design implications to better support potential donors to make more informed donation decisions.",

However, effectively embedding employee voice systems in organisations requires designers to engage with the social processes, power relations and contextual factors of individual workplaces. We explore this process within a university workplace through a research project responding to a crisis in educational service delivery arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Within a successful three-month staff-led engagement, we examined the intricacies of embedding employee voice, exploring how the interactions between existing actors impacted the effectiveness of the process. We sought to identify specific actions to promote employee voice and overcome barriers to its successful establishment in organisational decision-making. We highlight design considerations for an effective employee voice system that facilitates embedding employee voice, including assurance, bounded accountability and bias reflexivity.",

      "abstract": "Racial capitalism, which describes how people in power extract value from the racial identity of others, has been a constant driver in the creative industries. As social media becomes the widespread avenue for sharing creative works and building professional reputation, the effects of racial capitalism become further amplified online. In fact, many creative professionals of color find that the biases they face offline are only replicated, and sometimes even magnified, online. We seek to understand how creative professionals of color navigate these expectations and perceptions of race on digital platforms. In this study, we interview creative professionals of color who heavily rely on digital platforms to promote their work in order to understand how racial capitalism shapes the experience and performance of race online. Creative professionals describe seeing their work appropriated and shared for little to no recognition, while at the same time, feeling pressured to present themselves in a palatable way in order to meet the expectations of a dominant consumer audience. Creatives also worked within these capitalistic expectations by building communities with similar others in order to exchange advice, serve as role models, and share resources. Our data uncover how expectations on social media, fueled by racial biases, burden creative professionals of color, thus informing alternative futures that could compensate their work more equitably and build more inclusive spaces for creative professional growth.",

      "abstract": "Open Data has become a prominent ideal in humanitarian information work and is increasingly promoted for crisis situations to increase effectiveness and accountability and empower citizens. However, like all socio-technical systems, disaster data platforms make implicit and explicit assumptions about dataset, data users, disasters, and the society. In this paper, we turn to feminist theory to highlight and link the socio-political nature of both disasters and open data platforms. We used the seven principles of Data Feminism introduced by D'Ignazio and Klein to design an evaluative framework to examine three open data projects rolled out in the aftermath of the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. Through this framework, we highlight significant gaps in how these projects made labor (in)visible, engaged with affective aspects of disaster, addressed context, and challenged power. We argue that these gaps are reflective of dominant practices in open data for disasters and serve as opportunities for designers and crisis informatics researchers to reimagine the goals and objective of such projects. We propose four ways of doing so based on feminist principles and values.",

Surging demands for a wide range of support could not be met solely by government-led disaster assistance that experienced breakdowns in the initial phase of the pandemic. The nature of the pandemic as a global, long-haul disaster necessitated sustained, diverse, and extensive civic disaster relief to complement government response. In this paper, we explore how civic disaster relief groups carry out online and offline coordination activities to engage different actors and their positive effects on individuals and local communities, drawing on interviews with civic disaster relief organizers and volunteers in the United States. We interpret our findings with the lens of coproduction, which can increase the sustainability, diversity, and extent of civic relief efforts. We then suggest design implications for coproducing disaster relief and discuss the importance and benefits of involving stakeholders who are less likely to be engaged in producing relief.",

The publicly visible information changes based on the account type and the visibility of tweets also depends solely on the poster's account type which can cause unintended disclosures especially when users interact. We surveyed 336 Twitter users to understand users’ awareness of account information visibility, as well as the tweet visibility when users interact. We find that our participants are aware of the visibility of their profile information and individual tweets. However, the visibility of followed topics, lists, and interactions with protected accounts is confusing. Only 31% of the participants were aware that a reply by a public account to a protected account’s tweet would be publicly visible. Surprisingly, having a protected account does not result in a better understanding of the account information or tweet visibility.",

Despite this fact, no research has explored how software developers approach requesting gender disclosure from users. To understand how developers think about gender in software, we present an interview study with 15 software developers recruited from the freelancing platform Upwork as well as Twitter. We also collected and categorized 917 threads which contained keywords relevant to gender from programming related sub-forums on the social media service Reddit. 16~posts that discussed approaches to gender disclosure were further analyzed. We found that while some developers have an understanding of inclusive gender options, programmers rarely consider when gender data is necessary or the way in which they request gender disclosure from users. Our findings have implications for programmers, software engineering educators, and the broader community concerned with inclusivity.",

While CSCW and HCI have largely celebrated the tremendous promise of ‘data-driven healthcare’ in reforming the healthcare sector, this paper reveals ‘labor-driven reality’ of this promised data-driven future. Drawing from a qualitative study in a real-world data-driven long-term care (LTC) facility in China, we demonstrate how data-driven technologies work in practice, and especially how frontline workers, as the crux of this data-driven configuration, conduct a tremendous amount of “data work” to make data-drivenness work. This data work, we argue, goes beyond the “clerical work” and functions as a labor of maintenance, articulation, and repair, that both guarantees data technologies’ functionalities and acts as an interface between stakeholders. We discuss the properties and impacts of this data work in a boarder socio-cultural context, and highlight how socio-cultural context, perceptions, and existing technologies influence data work practices. Based on these findings, we propose ways to enable more just and ethical data-driven futures.",

Participants interacted with two AI-based chess engines, trustworthy (competent, fair) and untrustworthy (incompetent, unfair), that coached participants by suggesting chess moves in three games against another engine opponent. We varied coaches' transparency about their competence (with the untrustworthy one always exaggerating its competence). We quantified and objectively measured participants' trust based on how often participants relied on coaches' move recommendations. Participants showed inability to assess AI competence by misplacing their trust with the untrustworthy AI, confirming its ability to deceive. Our work calls for design of interactions to help end-users assess AI trustworthiness.",

      "abstract": "Transparency matters a lot to people who experience moderation on online platforms; much CSCW research has viewed offering explanations as one of the primary solutions to enhance moderation transparency. However, relatively little attention has been paid to unpacking what transparency entails in moderation design, especially for content creators. We interviewed 28 YouTubers to understand their moderation experiences and analyze dimensions of moderation transparency. We identified four primary dimensions: participants desired the moderation system to present moderation punishments saliently, explain punishments profoundly, afford communication with them effectively, and offer repairment and learning opportunities. We discuss how these four dimensions are mutually constitutive and conditioned in the context of creator moderation, where the target of governance mechanisms extends beyond the content to include the creator. We then elaborate on how a dynamic, transparency perspective could value content creators’ digital labor, how transparency design could support creators’ learning, as well as implications for transparency design of other creator platforms.

Within these breakout sessions, students are expected to work together to complete an assignment. Through 669 surveys and 19 interviews, our paper outlines the successes and challenges of breakout sessions and teamwork in virtual learning environments faced by professors, graduate teaching assistants, and students. Our findings show the importance of pedagogical research for online environments, the student need for persistent instructions and check-ins to facilitate teamwork in breakout sessions, and strong justification for the use of breakout sessions in online courses. Based on our findings, we propose design recommendations to address the challenges highlighted within the classroom and software used by instructors and students. Our work contributes and extends previous CSCW and HCI research in online distributed teamwork and education.",

We argue that these two tasks — making the software work for themselves and also for their wider scientific community — could not be differentiated from each other at the beginning of the software development process. Rather, this division of labor and software capacities emerged, articulated by the actors themselves as they went about their tasks. The activities of making the novel software “work” at all, and the “extra work” of making that software repurposable or reusable could not be distinguished until near the end of the development process — rather than defined or structured in advance. We discuss implications for the trajectory of software development, and the practical work of making software repurposable.",

      "abstract": "Despite debates about emotion artificial intelligence’s (EAI) validity, legality, and social consequences, EAI is increasingly present in the high stakes context of hiring, with potential to shape the future of work and the workforce. The values laden in technology play a significant role in its societal impact. We conducted qualitative content analysis on the public-facing websites (N =229) of EAI hiring services. We identify the organizational problems that EAI hiring services claim to solve and reveal the values emerging in desired EAI uses as promoted by EAI hiring services to solve organizational problems. Our findings show that EAI hiring services market their technologies as technosolutions to three purported organizational hiring problems: 1) hiring (in)accuracy,\r\n2) hiring (mis)fit, and 3) hiring (in)authenticity. We unpack these problems to expose how these desired uses of EAI are legitimized by the corporate ideals of data-driven decision making, continuous improvement, precision, loyalty, and stability. We identify the unfair and deceptive mechanisms by which EAI hiring services claim to solve the purported organizational hiring problems, suggesting that they unfairly exclude and exploit job candidates through EAI’s creation, extraction, and affective commodification of a candidate’s affective value through pseudoscientific approaches. Lastly, we interrogate EAI hiring service claims to reveal the core values that underpin their stated desired use: techno-omnipresence, techno-omnipotence, and techno-omniscience. We show how EAI hiring services position desired use of their technology as a moral imperative for hiring organizations with supreme capabilities to solve organizational hiring problems, then discuss implications for fairness, ethics, and policy in EAI-enabled hiring within the US policy landscape.",

      "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative force in communication and messaging strategy, with potential to disrupt traditional approaches. Large language models (LLMs), a form of AI, are capable of generating high-quality, humanlike text. We investigate the persuasive quality of AI-generated messages to understand how AI could impact public health messaging. Specifically, through a series of studies designed to characterize and evaluate generative AI in developing public health messages, we analyze COVID-19 pro-vaccination messages generated by GPT-3, a state of the art instantiation of a large language model. Study 1 is a systematic evaluation of GPT-3’s ability to generate pro-vaccination messages. Study 2 then observed peoples’ perceptions of curated GPT-3-generated messages compared to human-authored messages released by the CDC, finding that GPT-3 messages were perceived as more effective, stronger arguments, and evoked more positive attitudes than CDC messages. Finally, Study 3 assessed the role of source labels on perceived quality, finding that while participants preferred AI-generated messages, they expressed dispreference for messages that were labeled as AI-generated. The results suggest that with human supervision AI can be used to create effective public health messages, but that individuals prefer their public health messages to come from human institutions rather than AI sources. We propose best practices for assessing generative outputs of large language models in future social science research and the ways health professionals can use AI systems to augment public health messaging.",

      "abstract": "Peer code review is a widely practiced software engineering process in which software developers collaboratively evaluate and improve source code quality. Whether developers can perform good reviews depends on whether they have sufficient competence and experience. The lack of competencies can stand in the way of efficient code reviews. However, the knowledge of what competencies developers need to execute code review is currently limited, thus hindering, for example, the creation of effective support tools and training strategies.\r\n\r\nTo address this gap, we firstly identified 27 competencies relevant to performing code review through expert validation. Later, we conducted an online survey with 105 reviewers to rank these competencies along four dimensions: frequency of usage, importance, proficiency, and desire of reviewers to improve in that competency.  \r\n\r\nThe survey shows that technical competencies are considered essential to performing reviews and that respondents feel generally confident in their technical proficiency. Moreover, reviewers feel less confident in how to communicate clearly and give constructive feedback - competencies they consider like-wise an essential part of reviewing. Therefore, research and education should focus in more detail on how to support and develop reviewers’ potential to communicate effectively during reviews. In the paper, we also discuss further implications for training, code review performance assessment, and reviewers of different experience level.",

In this paper, we explore the role of photography to bring about social change in Bahrain, an island nation in the Arabian Peninsula. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, we describe how professional photographers capturing a controversial religious ritual of the Muslim-minority Shia employed a quiet form of activism we call ``comfort activism,'' small and embodied acts with technology that address areas of comfort/discomfort for themselves and groups with whom they have social ties with and themselves. We discuss how comfort activism points design toward advocacy goals such as equality that provide an alternative perspective to cultures---one that prioritizes individuals’ agencies and choices instead of static cultural norms and values.\r\n",

      "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in taste research in the HCI and CSCW communities. However, the focus is more on stimulating the senses, while the socio-cultural aspects have received less attention. However, individual taste perception is mediated through social interaction and collective negotiation and is not only dependent on physical stimulation. Therefore, we study the digital mediation of taste by drawing on ethnographic research of four online wine tastings and one self-organized event. Hence, we investigated the materials, associated meanings, competences, procedures, and engagements that shaped the performative character of tasting practices. We illustrate how the tastings are built around the taste-making process and how online contexts differ in providing a more diverse and distributed environment. We then explore the implications of our findings for the further mediation of taste as a social and democratized phenomenon through online interaction.",

Many communities (such as minority communities) suffered disproportionately more difficulties throughout the pandemic. In this paper, we would like to focus on one such community: COVID-19 long-haulers community. Long-hauler community consists of people affected by Coronavirus, but their symptoms do not cure in a couple of weeks; instead, they experience lingering symptoms for months. The concerns of this community were initially ignored by health care providers primarily because of limited information. In this paper, we have analyzed the social media discussion of a private Facebook group dedicated to the long-hauler community. In addition, we interviewed the community members to investigate their motivations for joining the group and how the group has impacted their lives as long-hauler patients. Our analyses revealed the primary discussion topics of this community. It also showed how a minority community could stand by each other using social media groups during a crisis. We concluded the paper with long-term implications of our findings for health care systems, policies, and existing literature on cooperative AI.",

      "abstract": "Sharing personal pronouns (such as they/them, she/her, or he/him) in the workplace helps colleagues respectfully address each other. Many companies currently seek to design and implement new software tools to facilitate pronoun-sharing among employees. This paper analyzes the social processes of communication about pronouns in the workplace and identifies best practices for creating and using workplace pronoun-sharing software. We conducted 78 semi-structured qualitative interviews with various stakeholders involved in the launch of pronoun-sharing tools in workplace collaboration software, including transgender and queer people, HR and IT professionals, and LGBTQ advocacy organizations. We used an anthropological approach to qualitatively analyze interview materials and notes from interactions with research participants. We find that sharing personal pronouns is an ongoing communication process rather than a single act of information provision. Pronoun sharing tools encapsulate the tension between dynamic social processes of self-expression and technical systems of classification and information retrieval. People communicate their pronouns differently as they navigate identity expression across social contexts. Sharing pronouns is therefore both an individual expression of self-presentation and a complex act of social communication. Developers must create new methods for building pronoun-sharing tools that equip people to control ongoing social processes of self-expression instead of using an information retrieval approach that treats pronouns merely as stable, unchanging data.",

Through semi-structured interviews with 17 U.S.-based social media users sharing weight-related journeys, we investigate the motivations for and impacts of returning to previously posted weight-related social media content. We show how these personal archives foster a contested relationship between one’s past and current self, where returning to past content facilitates dynamic interpretations of the self. We argue these interpretations' impacts cannot be understood without acknowledging and addressing the socio-technical context in which they exist: one filled with weight stigma, fatphobia, and narrow body ideals. We introduce the novel concepts of Transtemporal Support and Transtemporal Harm to describe the support and harms that one experiences in the present from returning to their past social media content. We posit that designs accounting for transtemporal support 1) can facilitate reflective sense-making for users who create repositories of digital artifacts about sensitive, potentially stigmatizing experiences on social media, and 2) should not perpetuate transtemporal harm.",

      "abstract": "Ethnic minorities experience challenges in sustaining their culture in regions dominated by ethnic majorities. With the popularity of video blogging (vlog) in China, many ethnic minority vloggers present and promote their ethnic culture through vlogs online. In this study, we interviewed 16 vloggers on Douyin o understand why and how vlogs can be used to sustain ethnic culture. Both ethnic cultural experts and non-experts were involved in ethnic vlog making and sharing activities in \\textit{Douyin}, and cultural experts took more initiations in preserving and promoting ethnic culture while non-experts were more driven by getting more traffic and income. Vloggers' imagined audience includes both intra-ethnic and mainstream viewers, impacting their vlog-making strategies, the utilized platform features, and created vlog content. For example, vloggers taught ethnic language and built an identity for intra-ethnic viewers, and they catered to mainstream viewers' needs for ``fresh'' by creating more acceptable meanwhile ``tagged'' and ``homogeneous'' content. Both ethnic minority vloggers and viewers protect their culture spontaneously from mainstream viewers' misinterpretation. Our findings demonstrate the potential of using video blogging to address the challenges of cultural sustainability and provide design implications for future information and communications\r\ntechnologies to support ethnic minorities' culture sustainability.

      "abstract": "As AI-mediated communication (AI-MC) becomes more prevalent in everyday interactions, it becomes increasingly important to develop a rigorous understanding of its effects on interpersonal relationships and on society at large. Controlled experimental studies offer a key means of developing such an understanding, but various complexities make it difficult for experimental AI-MC research to simultaneously achieve the criteria of experimental realism, experimental control, and scalability. After outlining these methodological challenges, this paper offers the concept of methodological middle spaces as a means to address these challenges. This concept suggests that the key to simultaneously achieving all three of these criteria is to abandon the perfect attainment of any single criterion. \r\nThis concept's utility is demonstrated via its use to guide the design of a platform for conducting text-based AI-MC experiments. Through a series of three example studies, the paper illustrates how the concept of methodological middle spaces can inform the design of specific experimental methods. Doing so enabled these studies to examine research questions that would have been either difficult or impossible to investigate using existing approaches. The paper concludes by describing how future research could similarly apply the concept of methodological middle spaces to expand methodological possibilities for AI-MC research in ways that enable contributions not currently possible.",

      "abstract": "Leveraging crowdsourcing in software development has received growing attention in research and practice. Crowd feedback offers a scalable and flexible way to evaluate software design solutions and the potential of crowd-feedback systems has been demonstrated in different contexts by existing research studies. However, previous research lacks a deep understanding of the effects of individual design features of crowd-feedback systems on feedback quality and quantity. Additionally, existing studies primarily focused on understanding the requirements of feedback requesters but have not fully explored the qualitative perspectives of crowd-based feedback providers. In this paper, we address these research gaps with two research studies. In study 1, we conducted a feature analysis (N=10) and concluded that from a user perspective a crowd-feedback system should have five core features (scenario, speech-to-text, markers, categories, and star rating). In the second study, we analyzed the effects of the design features on crowdworkers' perceptions and feedback outcomes (N=210). We learned that offering feedback providers scenarios as the context of use is perceived as most important. Regarding the resulting feedback quality, we discovered that more features are not always better as overwhelming feedback providers might decrease feedback quality. Offering feedback providers categories as inspiration can increase the feedback quantity. With our work, we contribute to research on crowd-feedback systems by aligning crowdworker perspectives and feedback outcomes and thereby making the software evaluation not only more scalable but also more human-centered.",

While much privacy research has focused on how users perceive privacy and interact with companies, we focus on how privacy legislation is discussed among a different set of relationships—those between companies and investors. This paper investigates how companies translate the GDPR and CCPA into business risks in documents created for investors. We conduct a qualitative document analysis of annual regulatory filings (Form 10-K) from nine major technology companies. We outline five ways that technology companies consider GDPR and CCPA as business risks, describing both direct and indirect ways that the legislation may affect their businesses. We highlight how these findings are relevant for the broader CSCW and privacy research communities in research, design, and practice. Creating meaningful privacy changes within existing institutional structures requires some understanding of the dynamics of these companies’ decision-making processes and the role of capital. ",

      "abstract": "Technology use in acute care has so far been studied with a predominant focus on safety and efficiency rather than the experience of acute care staff. In the present paper, we report a qualitative study including 130 hours of participant observation on acute care teams and retrospective interviews with nine anesthesiologists on their experiences with technology. Our approach is theoretically guided by four modern HCI perspectives, namely psychological need satisfaction, activity theory, embodied interaction, and media equation theory. We analyzed the interview and observation data using a reflexive thematic analysis and identified four themes. Technology as necessary (evil) describes the pervasiveness of technology and how acute care teams depend on technology. While technology as second patient covers the additional load for anesthesiologists on a functional and emotional level, technology as problem solver and safety net highlights relieving aspects of technology use. Technology as artificial limb focuses on so-called transparent tools that extend the body and capabilities of users. We then discuss the identified themes concerning the previously presented theories. Based on our findings and theoretical perspectives, we report general insights for research and design in acute care, such as the benefits of mixed methods or the importance of the gut feelings of experts. Finally, we propose possible directions for future work, such as developing a UX questionnaire adapted to the context of safety-critical domains, such as acute care.",

      "abstract": "Good explanations help people understand hateful memes and mitigate sharing. While AI-enabled automatic detection has proliferated, we argue that quality-controlled crowdsourcing can be an effective strategy to offer good explanations for hateful memes. This paper proposes a Generate-Annotate-Revise workflow to crowdsource explanations and presents the results from two user studies. Study 1 evaluated the quality of explanation with an assessment rubric defining the common traits of hate speech: target, clarity, explicitness, and utility, and suggested that the proposed workflow generated higher quality explanations than the ones from a single-stage workflow without quality control. Study 2 used an online experiment to examine how different explanations affect users' perception. The results from 127 participants demonstrated that people without prior cultural knowledge gained significant perceived understanding and awareness of hateful memes when presented with explanations generated by the proposed multi-stage workflow as opposed to single-stage or machine-generated explanations.",

      "abstract": "Prior work has identified a variety of factors that drive the way people identify and respond to misinformation. Such factors include confirmation bias, perceived credibility of the information source, individual media literacy, social norms, and others. This paper reviews the interventions designed to address misinformation and examines how various underlying mechanisms of response to misinformation are operationalized and implemented in the reviewed interventions.  Key findings show that most prior work to address misinformation heavily focuses on individual pieces of misinformation and the actions individuals take in response to those individual pieces. These individualistic approaches, we argue, overlook the other drivers of responses to misinformation, such as individuals' prior beliefs and the social contexts in which misinformation is encountered.  Additionally, the analysis shows that an individualistic focus on misinformation draws attention away from the systemic nature and consequences of misinformation. This paper argues that to overcome the limitation of individualistic approaches to addressing misinformation, future interventions need to expand their scope beyond individualistic approaches. As one way to do so, it discusses leveraging the impacts of community factors that impact the spread and impacts of misinformation. The paper concludes by using social norms as an example to illustrate how a focus on community factors might work in practice.",

To address this gap, we conducted 17 narrative interviews with victims of cyber fraud. We found that while it was seen to be important for victims to act immediately and to take countermeasures against attack, they often did not do so. In this paper, we describe this \"delay\" in victims' responses as entailing a period of doubt and trust in good faith. The delay in victim response is a direct consequence of various SE techniques, such as exploiting prosocial behavior with subsequent negative effects on emotional state and interpersonal relationships. Our findings contribute to shaping digital resistance by helping people identify and overcome delay techniques to combat their inaction and paralysis.",

Driven by social and economic forces affecting service delivery and an impulse to seek out efficiencies, these new technologies have transformed the labor that acts as the backbone to the industry—namely frontline service work performed by housekeepers, front desk staff, line cooks and others. We describe the context for recent technological adoption, with particular emphasis on algorithmic management applications. Through this work, we identify gaps in existing literature and highlight areas in need of further research in the domains of worker-centered technology development. Our analysis highlights how technologies such as algorithmic management shape roles and tasks in the high-touch service sector. We outline how harms produced through automation are often due to a lack of attention to non-management stakeholders. We describe an opportunity space for researchers and practitioners to elicit worker participation at all stages of technology adoption, and offer methods for centering workers, increasing transparency, and accounting for the context of use through holistic implementation and training strategies.",

Building upon recommendations based on prior research about tackling misinformation, we explore the potential to support media literacy through platform design. We develop and design an intervention consisting of a tweet trajectory—to illustrate how information reached a user—and contextual cues—to make credibility judgments about accounts that amplify, manufacture, produce or situate in the vicinity of problematic content (AMPS). Using a research through design approach, we demonstrate how the proposed intervention can help discern credible actors, challenge blind faith amongst online friends, evaluate the cost of associating with online actors, and expose hidden agendas. Such facilitation of credibility assessment can encourage more responsible sharing of content. Through our findings, we argue for using trajectory-based designs to support informed information sharing, advocate for feature updates that nudge users with reflective cues, and promote platform-driven media literacy.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being deployed in high-stakes domains, such as disaster relief and radiology, to aid practitioners during the decision-making process for interpreting images. Explainable AI techniques have been developed and deployed to provide users insights into why the AI made a certain prediction. However, recent research suggests that these techniques may confuse or mislead users. We conducted a series of two studies to uncover strategies human use to explain decisions and then understand how those explanation strategies impact visual decision-making. In our first study, we elicit explanations from humans when assessing and localizing damaged buildings after natural disasters from satellite imagery and identify four core explanation strategies that humans employed. We then follow-up by studying the impact of these explanation strategies by framing explanations from Study 1 as if they were generated by AI and showing them to a different set of decision-makers performing the same task. We provide initial insights on how causal explanation strategies improve humans' accuracy and calibrate humans' reliance on AI when the AI is incorrect. However, we also find that causal explanation strategies may lead to incorrect rationalizations when the AI presents a correct assessment with incorrect localization. We explore the implications of our findings for the design of human-centered explainable AI and address directions for future work.",

      "abstract": " Digital platforms, including online forums and helplines, have emerged as avenues of support for caregivers suffering from postpartum mental health distress. Understanding support seekers' experiences as shared on these platforms could provide crucial insight into caregivers' needs during this vulnerable time. In the current work, we provide a descriptive analysis of the concerns, psychological states, and motivations shared by healthy and distressed postpartum support seekers on two digital platforms, a one-on-one digital helpline and a publicly available online forum. Using a combination of human annotations, dictionary models and unsupervised techniques, we find stark differences between the experiences of distressed and healthy mothers. Distressed mothers described interpersonal problems and a lack of support,  with 8.60% - 14.56% reporting severe symptoms including suicidal ideation. In contrast, the majority of healthy mothers described childcare issues, such as questions about breastfeeding or sleeping, and reported no severe mental health concerns. Across the two digital platforms, we found that distressed mothers shared similar content. However, the patterns of speech and affect shared by distressed mothers differed between the helpline vs. the online forum, suggesting the design of these platforms may shape meaningful measures of their support-seeking experiences. Our results provide new insight into the experiences of caregivers suffering from postpartum mental health distress. We conclude by discussing methodological considerations for understanding content shared by support seekers and design considerations for the next generation of support tools for postpartum parents.",

      "abstract": "Immersive virtual reality (VR) has seen growth in usage over the last few years and that growth is expected to accelerate. Correspondingly, many VR-based online communities have begun to emerge, and several social VR applications such as AltspaceVR have gained significant popularity. However, virtual reality can be isolating. Users can meet and connect with people in VR, but inevitably, when a user removes their headset, their friends are no longer there. In this paper, we look at how communities in AltspaceVR, a popular social VR application, handle this challenge. We conduct fourteen interviews and over 70 hours of participant observation and find that AltspaceVR users and communities have turned to Discord to solve many of their needs, such as facilitating more ubiquitous communication, planning community activities and AltspaceVR Events, and hosting casual social discussion. By using the communicative ecology model for our analysis, we find that AltspaceVR, Discord, and the communities that intersect the two have formed a tightly-coupled communicative ecology, which we call the \"stage\" and \"theater\". Discord acts as the \"theater,\" where actors and crew collaborate and communicate to prepare for the main event, all the while building important social bonds. AltspaceVR acts as the \"stage,\" where those efforts manifest in ephemeral but high-value experiences that bring the community together. Finally, we compare the communities we studied with those found in massively-multiplayer online games (MMOGs) and provide insights regarding the design of social VR applications and online communities.",

      "abstract": "Social support or peer support in mental health has successfully settled down in online spaces by reducing the potential risk of critical mental illness (e.g., suicidal thoughts) of support-seekers. While the prior work has mostly focused on support-seekers, particularly investigating their behavioral characteristics and the effects of online social supports to support-seekers, this paper seeks to understand online social support from supporters' perspectives, who have informational or emotional resources that may affect support-seekers either positively or negatively. To this end, we collect and analyze a large-scale of dataset consisting of the supporting comments and their target posts from 55 mental health communities in Reddit. We also develop a deep-learning-based model that scores informational and emotional support to the supporting comments. Based on the collected and scored dataset, we measure the characteristics of the supporters from the behavioral and content perspectives, which reveals that the supporters tend to give emotional support than informational support and the atmosphere of social support communities tend also to be emotional. We also understand the relations between the supporters and the support-seekers by giving a notion of ``social supporting network'', whose nodes and edges are the sets of the users and the supporting comments. Our analysis on top users by out-degrees and in-degrees in social supporting network demonstrates that heavily-supportive users are more likely to give informational support with diverse content while the users who attract much support exhibit continuous support-seeking behaviors by uploading multiple posts with similar content. Lastly, we identified structural communities in social supporting network to explore whether and how the supporters and the support-seeking users are grouped. By conducting topic analysis on both the support-seeking posts and the supporting comments of individual communities, we revealed that small communities deal with a specific topic such as hair-pulling disorder. We believe that the methodologies, dataset, and findings can not only expose more research questions on online social supports in mental health, but also provide insight on improving social support in online platforms.",

We present a videoconferencing module that visualizes the user's aural environment to enhance awareness between interlocutors.\r\nThe system visualizes environmental sound based on its semantic and acoustic properties.

      "abstract": "Digitally replicating the appearance and behaviour of individuals is becoming feasible with recent advancements in deep-learning technologies such as interactive deepfake applications, voice conversion, and virtual actors. Interactive applications of such agents, termed AI clones, pose risks related to impression management, identity abuse, and unhealthy dependencies. Identifying concerns AI clones will generate is a prerequisite to establishing the basis of discourse around how this technology will impact a source individual's selfhood and interpersonal relationships. We presented 20 participants of diverse ages and backgrounds with 8 speculative scenarios to explore their perception towards the concept of AI clones. We found that (1. doppelganger-phobia) the abusive potential of AI clones to exploit and displace the identity of an individual elicits negative emotional reactions; (2. identity fragmentation) creating replicas of a living individual threatens their cohesive self-perception and unique individuality; and (3. living memories) interacting with a clone of someone with whom the user has an existing relationship poses risks of misrepresenting the individual or developing over-attachment to the clone. These findings provide an avenue to discuss preliminary ethical implications, respect for identity and authenticity, and design recommendations for creating AI clones.",

Based on this data, we leveraged a human-centered machine learning approach to create sexual risk detection classifiers for youth social media conversations. \r\nOur Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Random Forest models outperformed in identifying sexual risks at the conversation-level (AUC=0.88), and CNN outperformed at the message-level (AUC=0.85). We also trained classifiers to detect the severity risk level (i.e., safe, low, medium-high) of a given message with CNN outperforming other models (AUC=0.88).\r\nA feature analysis yielded deeper insights into patterns found within sexually safe versus unsafe conversations. We found that contextual features (e.g., age, gender, and relationship type) and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) contributed the most for accurately detecting sexual conversations that made youth feel uncomfortable or unsafe. \r\nOur analysis provides insights into the important factors and contextual features that enhance automated detection of sexual risks within youths' private conversations. As such, we make valuable contributions to the computational risk detection and adolescent online safety literature through our human-centered approach of collecting and ground truth coding private social media conversations of youth for the purpose of risk classification.",

      "abstract": "People experiencing mental illness are often forced into a system in which their chances of finding relief are largely determined by institutions that evaluate whether their distress deserves treatment. These governing institutions can be offline, such as the American healthcare system, and can also be online, such as online social platforms. As work in HCI and CSCW frames technology-mediated support as one method to fill structural gaps in care, in this study, we ask the question: how do online and offline institutions influence how people in resource-scarce areas come to understand and express their distress online? We situate our work in U.S. Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas (MHPSAs), or areas in which there are too few mental health professionals to meet expected need. We use an analysis of illness narratives to answer this question, conducting a large scale linguistic analysis of social media posts to understand broader trends in expressions of distress online. We then build on these analyses via in-depth interviews with 18 participants with lived experience of mental illness, and analyze the role of online and offline institutions how participants express distress online. Through our findings, we argue that a consideration of institutions is crucial in designing effective technology-mediated support, and discuss the implications of considering institutions in mental health support for platform designers.

      "abstract": "Ubiquitous computing encapsulates the idea for technology to be interwoven into the fabric of everyday life. As computing blends into everyday physical artifacts, powerful opportunities open up for social connection. Prior connected media objects span a broad spectrum of design combinations. Such diversity suggests that people have varying needs and preferences for staying connected to one another. However, since these designs have largely been studied in isolation, we do not have a holistic understanding around how people would configure and behave within a ubiquitous social ecosystem of physically-grounded artifacts. In this paper, we create a technology probe called Social Wormholes, that lets people configure their own home ecosystem of connected artifacts. Through a field study with 24 participants, we report on patterns of behaviors that emerged naturally in the context of their daily lives and shine a light on how ubiquitous computing could be leveraged for social computing.",

      "abstract": "This paper attempts to (re)theorize the nature and role of hope in collaborative and interventionist CSCW and HCI projects.  Drawing on work in anthropology, STS, CSCW and HCI, and extended reflection on the 3Dprintability project (a multinational collaboration dedicated to the 3D printing of prosthetics in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia), it advocates for a more pluralistic and action-oriented practice of hope built around moments of collaborative reopening, repetition and resetting.  It then argues for a more robust HCI method of hope that can change the way interventionist projects are conceived, documented, evaluated, and communicated, both in the HCI literature and more public-facing project accounts.

      "abstract": "The similarity effect refers to the tendency for people to be more easily influenced by others who resemble them in appearance. This phenomenon has been found to have positive impacts, including on the building of trust, that enrich the quality of communication (e.g., fluency or collaboration performance). While research has shown that the similarity effect occurs in screen-based communication platforms, it remains unclear how this phenomenon impacts user perceptions, especially of others' persuasiveness, in immersive environments such as virtual reality (VR). In this study, we adopted a mixed-methods approach to exploring how interaction with avatars of similar appearance to one's own self-representation influences conversations. Such similarity was operationalized as having three levels: identicality, moderate similarity, and dissimilarity. The study found that avatars of moderate similarity have the greatest persuasiveness; however, in both identicality and moderate similarity conditions, participants felt it was easier to communicate with and lower eeriness rating to avatars than in the dissimilarity condition. Multiple linear regression further revealed that users who had relatively low self-esteem and/or were relatively conscientious were more susceptible to the positive effect of appearance similarity on persuasiveness. We conclude that the similarity effect, especially when the similarity in question is moderate, could be leveraged to support persuasiveness in VR-based communication.",

      "abstract": "AI explanations are often mentioned as a way to improve human-AI decision-making, but empirical studies have not found consistent evidence of explanations' effectiveness and, on the contrary, suggest that they can increase overreliance when the AI system is wrong. While many factors may affect reliance on AI support, one important factor is how decision-makers reconcile their own intuition---beliefs or heuristics, based on prior knowledge, experience, or pattern recognition, used to make judgments---with the information provided by the AI system to determine when to override AI predictions. We conduct a think-aloud, mixed-methods study with two explanation types (feature- and example-based) for two prediction tasks to explore how decision-makers' intuition affects their use of AI predictions and explanations, and ultimately their choice of when to rely on AI. Our results identify three types of intuition involved in reasoning about AI predictions and explanations: intuition about the task outcome, features, and AI limitations. Building on these, we summarize three observed pathways for decision-makers to apply their own intuition and override AI predictions. We use these pathways to explain why (1) the feature-based explanations we used did not improve participants' decision outcomes and increased their overreliance on AI, and (2) the example-based explanations we used improved decision-makers' performance over feature-based explanations and helped achieve complementary human-AI performance. Overall, our work identifies directions for further development of AI decision-support systems and explanation methods that help decision-makers effectively apply their intuition to achieve appropriate reliance on AI. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Many in-home systems are designed to monitor the real-time status of seniors at home and provide information to their adult children. However, we observed that the needs and concerns of both sides in the information sharing process are often not aligned. In this research, we examined the design of a system that mitigates the privacy needs of aging adults in light of the information desires of adult children. We apply an iterative process to design and evaluate a visualization of indoor location data and compare its benefits to displaying raw video from cameras. We elaborate on the tradeoffs surrounding privacy and awareness made by older adults and their children, and synthesize design criteria for designing a visualization system to manage these tensions and tradeoffs.",

In this study, we explored the user experience on a testbed for cloud computing research, the Cloud Computing Platform (CCP; a pseudonym). Through 15 semi-structured interviews and observation, we observed the importance of time as a resource to system users. We observed CCP users strategically coordinating their time on the platform with other users, navigating the constraints of publication and other academic deadlines. Surprisingly, we found that this coordination may involve altruistic behaviors where users share time on CCP that had been allocated for personal use. In light of prior CSCW literature on how actors seek to harness time, we propose concrete opportunities for design interventions. Our strategy across all possible interventions is to increase users’ awareness of the rhythms affecting their peers’ platform use, allowing coordination based not just on knowledge of CCP reservations but also users' progress toward deadlines. The implications of this work inform the design of other similar cyberinfrastructure systems in science where users independently coordinate use of resources.",

      "abstract": "Peer production systems have frictions–mechanisms that make contributing more effortful–to prevent vandalism and protect information quality. Page protection on Wikipedia is a mechanism where the platform’s core values conflict, but there is little quantitative work to ground deliberation. In this paper, we empirically explore the consequences of page protection on Internet Culture articles on Wikipedia (6,264 articles, 108 edit-protected). We first qualitatively analyzed 150 requests for page protection, finding that page protection is motivated by an article's (1) activity, (2) topic area, and (3) visibility. These findings informed a matching approach to compare protected pages and similar unprotected articles. We quantitatively evaluate the differences between protected and unprotected pages across two dimensions: editor engagement and contributor concentration. Protected articles show different trends in editor engagement and equity amongst contributors, affecting the overall disparity in the population. We discuss the role of friction in online platforms, new ways to measure it, and future work.",

      "abstract": "We investigate how robotic camera systems can offer new capabilities to computer-supported cooperative work through the design, development, and evaluation of a prototype system called Periscope. With Periscope, a local worker completes manipulation tasks with guidance from a remote helper who observes the workspace through a camera mounted on a semi-autonomous robotic arm that is co-located with the worker. Our key insight is that the helper, the worker, and the robot should all share responsibility of the camera view—an approach we call shared camera control. Using this approach, we present a set of modes that distribute the control of the camera between the human collaborators and the autonomous robot depending on task needs. We demonstrate the system’s utility and the promise of shared camera control through a preliminary study where 12 dyads collaboratively worked on assembly tasks and discuss design and research implications of our work for future robotic camera system that facilitate remote collaboration.",

      "abstract": "Branching is a feature of distributed version control systems that facilitates the \"divide and conquer\" strategy present in complex and collaborative work domains. Branching has revolutionized modern software development and has the potential to similarly transform hardware product development via CAD (computer-aided design). Yet, contrasting with its status in software, branching as a feature of commercial CAD systems is in its infancy, and little research exists to investigate its use in the digital design and development of physical products. To address this knowledge gap, in this paper, we mine and analyze 719 user-generated posts from online CAD forums to qualitatively study designers’ intentions for and preliminary use of branching in CAD. Our work contributes a taxonomy of CAD branching use cases, an identification of deficiencies of existing branching capabilities in CAD, and a discussion of the untapped potential of CAD branching to support a new paradigm of collaborative mechanical design. The insights gained from this study may help CAD tool developers address design shortcomings in CAD branching tools and assist CAD practitioners by raising their awareness of CAD branching to improve design efficiency and collaborative workflows in hardware development teams.",

Robots engage children and provide interaction that is free of the potential judgment of human peers and adults. Research in socially assistive robots for children generally focuses on therapeutic and educational outcomes for those children, informed by a vision of autonomous robots. This perspective ignores therapists and educators, who operate these robots in practice. Through nine interviews with individuals who have used robots to deliver socially assistive services to neurodivergent children, we (1) define a dual-cycle model of therapy that helps capture the domain expert view of therapy, (2) identify six core themes of teleoperator needs and patterns across these themes, (3) provide high-level guidelines and detailed recommendations for designing teleoperated socially assistive robot systems, and (4) outline a vision of robot-assisted therapy informed by these guidelines and recommendations that centers teleoperators of socially assistive robots in practice.",

      "abstract": "This paper zooms in on a particularly precarious and largely invisibilized group of care workers: middle-aged and less-educated female migrant workers from rural China. Drawing from a mixed-methods study, we specifically examine how the extensive use of data-driven technologies impact care workers’ wellbeing in the workplace. Our findings suggest the extensive use of data-driven healthcare technologies are eroding care workers’ workplace wellbeing, especially their sense of identity, agency, and perceived justice. Specifically, under the data-driven workplace, care workers are treated as a servant to data, instead of a human with agency and knowledge. They are no merely care workers who provide various care services for care receivers, but also data workers, whose practices and agency are greatly limited by data. This aggravates preexisting hardship of care workers, and reproduces new social injustice. We suggest CSCW researchers and practitioners take into account how per-existing social structures shape the designs of socio-technological systems, and reconceptualize the paradigm of “data-drivenness” for more just and ethical data-driven healthcare technologies.

      "abstract": "The past decade in the US has been one of the most politically polarizing in recent memory. Ordinary Democrats and Republicans fundamentally dislike and distrust each other, even when they agree on policy issues. This increase in hostility towards opposing party supporters, commonly called affective polarization, has important ramifications that threaten democracy. Political science research suggests that at least part of the polarization stems from Democrats' misperceptions about Republicans' political views and vice-versa. Therefore, in this work, drawing on insights from political science and game studies research, we designed an online casual game that combines the relaxed, playful nonpartisan norms of casual games with corrective information about party supporters' political views that are often misperceived. Through an experiment, we found that playing the game significantly reduces negative feelings toward outparty supporters among Democrats, but not Republicans. It was also effective in improving willingness to talk politics with outparty supporters. Further, we identified psychological reactance as a potential mechanism that affects the effectiveness of depolarization interventions. Finally, our analyses suggest that the game versions with political content were rated to be just as fun to play as a game version without any political content suggesting that, contrary to popular belief, people do like to mix politics and play.",

      "abstract": "Youth regularly use artificial intelligence (AI) technology, but it is increasingly well-known that AI can have bias. In turn, this bias can cause harm on small and large scales, especially for those underrepresented in tech fields. Recently, users have played active roles in surfacing and mitigating harm from algorithmic bias. However, despite being frequent users of AI, youth have been under-explored as potential contributors to the future of ethical technology. We consider three notions that may be at the root of youth facing barriers to playing an active role in fair AI, which are youth (1) cannot understand the technical aspects of AI, (2) cannot understand the ethical issues around AI, and (3) need protection from serious topics related to bias and injustice. In this study, we worked with youth (N = 30) in first through twelfth grade and parents (N = 6) to explore how youth can be part of identifying algorithmic bias and designing future systems to address problematic technology behavior. We found that youth are capable of identifying and articulating algorithmic bias, often in great detail. Participants suggested different ways users could give feedback for AI that reflects their values of diversity and inclusion. Youth who may have less experience with computing or exposure to societal structures can be supported by peers or adults with more of this knowledge, leading to critical conversations about fair AI. This work illustrates youths' insights, suggesting that they should be integrated in building a future of fair and accountable AI.",

      "abstract": "The local explanation provides heatmaps on images to explain how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) derive their output. Due to its visual straightforwardness, the method has been one of the most popular explainable AI (XAI) methods for diagnosing CNNs. Through our formative study (S1), however, we captured ML engineers' ambivalent perspective about the local explanation as a valuable and indispensable envision in building CNNs versus the process that exhausts them due to the heuristic nature of detecting vulnerability. Moreover, steering the CNNs based on the vulnerability learned from the diagnosis seemed highly challenging. To mitigate the gap, we designed DeepFuse, the first interactive design that realizes the direct feedback loop between a user and CNNs in diagnosing and revising CNN's vulnerability using local explanations. DeepFuse helps CNN engineers to systemically search \"unreasonable\" local explanations and annotate the new boundaries for those identified as unreasonable in a labor-efficient manner. Next, it steers the model based on the given annotation such that the model doesn't introduce similar mistakes. We conducted a two-day study (S2) with 12 experienced CNN engineers. Using DeepFuse, participants made a more accurate and \"reasonable\" model than the current state-of-the-art. Also, participants found the way DeepFuse guides case-based reasoning can practically improve their current practice. We provide implications for design that explain how future HCI-driven design can move our practice forward to make XAI-driven insights more actionable.\r\n",

We present an ethnographic study of a large-scale real-world integration of an AI system for resource allocation in a call-based maternal and child health program in India. Our findings uncover complexities around determining who benefits from the intervention, how the human-AI collaboration is managed, when intervention must take place in alignment with various priorities, and why the AI is sought, for what purpose. Our paper offers takeaways for human-centered AI integration in public health, drawing attention to the work done by the AI as actor, the work of configuring the human-AI partnership with multiple diverse stakeholders, and the work of aligning program goals for design and implementation through continual dialogue across stakeholders.",

We introduce a theoretical framework for understanding how random error and measurement bias enter into crowdsourced annotations of subjective constructs. We then propose a pipeline that combines pairwise comparison labelling with Elo scoring, and demonstrate that it outperforms the ubiquitous majority-voting method in reducing both types of measurement error. To assess the performance of the labelling approaches, we constructed an agent-based model of crowdsourced labelling that lets us introduce different types of subjectivity into the tasks. We find that under most conditions with task subjectivity, the comparison approach produced higher f1 scores. Further, the comparison approach is less susceptible to inflating bias, which majority voting tends to do. To facilitate applications, we show with simulated and real-world data that the number of required random comparisons for the same classification accuracy scales log-linearly O(N log N) with the number of labelled items. We also implemented the Elo system as an open-source Python package.",

      "abstract": "While a vast collection of explainable AI (XAI) algorithms have been developed in recent years, they have been criticized for significant gaps with how humans produce and consume explanations. As a result, current XAI techniques are often found to be hard to use and lack effectiveness. In this work, we attempt to close these gaps by making AI explanations selective---a fundamental property of human explanations---by selectively presenting a subset of model reasons based on what aligns with the recipient’s preferences. We propose a general framework for generating selective explanations by leveraging human input on a small sample. This framework opens up a rich design space that accounts for different selectivity goals, types of input, and more. As a showcase, we use a decision-support task to explore selective explanations based on what the decision-maker would consider relevant to the decision task. We conducted two experimental studies to examine three possible paradigms based on our proposed framework: in Study 1, we ask the participants to provide critique-based or open-ended input to generate selective explanations (self-input). In Study 2, we show the participants selective explanations based on input from a panel of similar users (annotators). Our experiments demonstrate the promise of selective explanations in reducing over-reliance on AI and improving decision outcomes and subjective perceptions of the AI, but also paint a nuanced picture that attributes some of these positive effects to the opportunity to provide one’s own input to augment AI explanations. Overall, our work proposes a novel XAI framework inspired by human communication behaviors and demonstrates its potential to encourage future work to make AI explanations more human-compatible.",

      "abstract": "Recent interest in design through the artificial intelligence (AI) lens is rapidly increasing. Designers, as a special user group interacting with AI, have received more attention in the Human-Computer Interaction community. Prior work has discussed emerging challenges that persist in designing for AI. However, few systematic reviews focus on \\textit{AI for design} to understand how designers and AI can augment each other's complementary strengths in design collaboration. In this work, we conducted a landscape analysis of AI for design, via a systematic literature review of 93 papers. The analysis first provides a bird's eye view of overall patterns in this area. The analysis also reveals three themes interpreted from the paper corpus associated with AI for design, including AI assisting designers, designers assisting AI, and characterizing designer-AI collaboration. We discuss the implications of our findings and suggested methodological proposals to guide HCI toward research and practices that center on collaborative creativity.",

      "abstract": "Getting training data for machine learning (ML) prediction of mental illness on social media data is labor intensive. To work around this, ML teams will extrapolate proxy signals, or alternative signs from data to evaluate illness status and create training datasets. However, these signals' validity has not been determined, whether signals align with important contextual factors, and how proxy quality impacts downstream model integrity. We use ML and qualitative methods to evaluate whether a popular proxy signal, diagnostic self-disclosure, produces a conceptually sound ML model of mental illness. Our findings identify major conceptual errors only seen through a qualitative investigation -- training data built from diagnostic disclosures encodes a narrow vision of diagnosis experiences that propagates into paradoxes in the downstream ML model. This gap is obscured by strong performance of the ML classifier (F1 = 0.91). We discuss the implications of conceptual gaps in creating training data for human-centered models, and make suggestions for improving research methods. ",

      "abstract": "One-on-one tutoring is effective for learning computer science since a tutor can sit beside a student and provide tailored feedback on their code. However, translating this type of instruction to a remote setting is challenging. Traditional methods such as screensharing lack necessary functionality and most available tools are designed for collaboration rather than instruction. To identify tools that can support remote tutoring, we conducted an experiment to assess two resources: synchronous editing and awareness tools. In our study, an instructor teaches a learner introductory programming concepts remotely, collaborating through screensharing alone, a shared notebook with real-time collaborative editing, or a shared notebook with additional awareness tools overlaid. To embed the awareness tools, we designed an open-source Chrome extension that enables real-time sharing of gaze and cursor data. Our results show that synchronous editing combined with awareness tools significantly improved learning. The awareness tools also helped tutors better communicate with the student, track their understanding, and establish a sense of presence. As a final contribution, we also assessed the efficacy of gaze-sharing using a webcam eye-tracker. While the accuracy was not as precise as a dedicated sensor, instructors described instances when the gaze was useful for gauging student attention and establishing presence. We discuss implications for remote tutoring in computer science and scaling awareness technology. ",

      "abstract": "It was previously hypothesized that gender differences -- and thus gender discrimination -- would disappear if communication was no longer in person, and instead was transmitted and received in the same format for all. Yet, even online, researchers have identified gendered language styles in written communication that reveal gender cues and can lead to unequal treatment. In this work, we revisit these past findings and ask whether the same gendered patterns can be found on modern communication platforms, which present a new set of engagement features and mixed synchronous capabilities. We quantitatively analyze 335,000 Slack messages sent by 845 individuals as part of 46 teams, collected over six years of a product design capstone course. We found little evidence of traditionally gendered communication styles (characterized as elaborate, uncertain, and supportive) from the minority-gender participants. We did identify relationships between message author gender, communication style, and message engagement --- women and minority genders were more likely to have their messages engaged with, but only when using certain communication styles --- suggesting complex power dynamics exist on these platforms. We contribute the first study of gendered language styles on Enterprise Communication Platforms, adding to the community's understanding of how new settings and emerging technology relate to team collaborative dynamics, and motivating future tool development to support collaboration in diverse teams.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being considered to assist human decision-making in high-stake domains (e.g. health). In particular, AI models aim to bring complementary, data-driven insights to human experts’ knowledge to improve a decision outcome that either an AI model or a human cannot achieve alone. However, researchers have discussed an issue that humans over-rely on imperfect suggestions of the AI model. In this work, we utilized salient features and what-if, counterfactual explanations to make humans review AI suggestions more thoroughly and explore the effect of these explanations on trust and reliance on AI during clinical decision-making. We conducted an experiment with seven therapists and ten novices on the task of assessing post-stroke survivors' quality of motion, in which we analyzed their performance, agreement level on the task without and with two types of AI explanations and their reliance on AI. Our results showed that the human + AI team with both salient features and counterfactual explanations assisted to improve the performance and agreement level on the task when `right' AI outputs are presented. Otherwise, both therapists and novices over-relied on `wrong' AI outputs. \\red{Specifically, novices had higher performance degrades by 18.0 f1-score with salient features and 14.0 f1-score with counterfactuals than therapists with performance degrades of 8.6 and 2.8 f1-scores respectively}. When `wrong' AI outputs are presented, counterfactual explanations assisted both therapists and novices to reduce their over-reliance on `wrong' AI outputs by 21\\% compared to salient feature explanations. Our work discusses the potential of counterfactual explanations to better estimate the accuracy of an AI model and reduce over-reliance on `wrong' AI outputs and implications for improving human-AI collaborative decision-making.",

      "abstract": "As social Virtual Reality (VR) grows in prevalence, new possibilities for embodied and immersive social interaction emerge, including varied forms of interpersonal harm. Yet, challenges remain regarding defining, identifying, and mitigating said harm in social VR. In this paper, we take an alternative approach to understanding and designing solutions for interpersonal harm in social VR through the lens of consent, which circumvents the lack of consensus and social norms on what should be defined as harm in social VR and reflects the embodied, immersive, and offline-world-like nature of harm in social VR. Through interviews with 39 social VR users, we offer one of the first empirical explorations on how social VR users understand consent as \"boundaries,\" (re)purpose existing social VR features for practicing consent as \"boundary setting,\" and envision the design of future consent mechanics in social VR to balance protection and interaction expectations to mitigate interpersonal harm as \"boundary violations\" in social VR. This work makes significant contributions to CSCW and HCI research by (1) uncovering how social VR users craft novel conceptualizations of consent as boundaries and harm as unwanted boundary violations, and (2) providing three foundational principles for designing future consent mechanics in social VR informed by actual social VR users.",

      "abstract": "While video conferencing is prevalent, concurrent participation channels are limited. People experience challenges keeping up with the discussion and misunderstanding frequently occurs. Through a formative study, we probed into the design space of providing real-time transcripts as an extra communication space for video meeting attendees. We then present MeetScript, a system that provides parallel participation channels through real-time interactive transcripts. MeetScript visualizes the discussion through a chat-alike interface and allows meeting attendees to make real-time collaborative annotations. Over time, MeetScript gradually hides extraneous content to retain the most essential information on the transcript, with the goal of reducing the cognitive load required on users to process the information in real time. In an experiment with 80 users in 22 teams, we compared MeetScript with two baseline conditions where participants used Zoom alone (business-as-usual), or Zoom with an adds-on transcription service (Otter.ai). We found that MeetScript significantly enhanced people's non-verbal participation and recollection of their teams' decision-making processes compared to the baselines. Users liked that MeetScript allowed them to easily navigate the transcript, and contextualize feedback and new ideas with existing ones. ",

In this paper, we explore the tensions between the individual and their team, focusing on the choices an individual makes towards their own productivity versus their team's productivity. We developed a technology probe with a team nudge that fosters recurring reflection and prompts individuals to consider how their team helps them to be productive. We examined its impact through a longitudinal field study with 48 participants. We chose to undertake this study with software development teams as they are examples of knowledge workers who collaborate on a shared set of tasks with specific goals. Our exploration took place with hybrid development teams, which have increasingly become the norm. Our analysis of a total of 8338 hourly self-reports and 1389 daily diary entries found that the team nudge increased participants' productivity ratings and team awareness, led to participants spending more time on their own tasks, reshaped their perceptions of themselves and their team, yet, in general, did not increase team cohesion or affect well-being.",

      "abstract": "Robots are increasingly being deployed as security agents helping law enforcement in spaces such as streets, parks, or shopping malls. Unfortunately, the deployment of security robots is not without problems and controversies. For example, the New York Police Department canceled its contract with Boston Dynamics in response to backlash from their use of Digidog, an autonomous robotic dog, which sparked fears in the public. However, it is unclear to what extent affected communities have been involved in the design and deployment process of robots. This is problematic because, without input from community members in the processes of design and deployment, security robots are likely to not satisfy the concerns or safety needs of real communities. To gain deeper insight into people’s perceptions of security robots—including both potential benefits and concerns—we conducted 17 semi-structured interviews addressing the following research questions: RQ1. What characteristics do people ascribe to security robots? RQ2. What expectations do people have about the function and role of security robots? RQ3. What are people’s attitudes toward the use of security robots? Our study offers several contributions to the existing literature on security robots.\r\n",

However, new contexts and systems always bring new ways of harassment and need new moderation mechanisms. This study focuses on \\textit{hate raids}, a form of group attack in real-time in live streaming communities. Through a qualitative analysis of hate raids discussion in the Twitch subreddit (r/Twitch), we found that (1) hate raids as a human-bot coordinated group attack leverages the live stream system to attack marginalized streamers and other potential groups with(out) breaking the rules, (2) marginalized streamers suffer compound harms with insufficient support from the platform, (3) moderation strategies are overwhelmingly technical, but streamers still struggle to balance moderation and participation considering their marginalization status and needs. We use affordances as a lens to explain how hate raids happens in live streaming systems and propose \\textit{moderation-by-design} as a lens when developing new features or systems to mitigate the potential abuse of such designs.

Yet, concerns have been raised about shrimps produced in India not qualifying the global safety standards. In this paper, we took an ethnographic approach to understand the traditional farming practices followed by shrimp farmers in India. We interviewed 29 shrimp farmers from Andhra Pradesh in India for eight months. We learned that most experienced and large-scale shrimp farmers in India prefer to follow traditional practices in their shrimp farms. They prefer to adopt technology-driven solutions in their farming only if absolutely needed. However, we observed that young, small-scale farmers are more open to trying new technologies in their farming. We discussed several areas where initiatives can be taken to encourage more Indian shrimp farmers to adopt new technology-driven solutions in their farming. ",

Using a VPN to access the Tor network, i.e., Tor over VPN, is an interesting example of security folklore because of its inconclusive security benefits and its occurrence in pop-culture media.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Theory of Reasoned Action, we investigated the phenomenon with three studies:\r\n(1) we quantified the behavior on real-world Tor traffic and measured a prevalence of 6.23\\%;\r\n(2) we surveyed users' intentions and beliefs, discovering that they try to protect themselves from the Tor network or increase their general security; and \r\n(3) we analyzed online information sources, suggesting that perceived norms and ease-of-use play a significant role while behavioral beliefs about the purpose and effect are less crucial in spreading security folklore.\r\nWe discuss how to communicate security advice effectively and combat security misinformation and misconceptions.",

      "abstract": "As the shortage of skilled workers continues to be a pressing issue, exacerbated by demographic change, it is becoming a critical challenge for organizations to preserve the knowledge of retiring experts and to pass it on to novices. While this knowledge transfer has traditionally taken place through personal interaction, it lacks scalability and requires significant resources and time. IT-based teaching systems have addressed this scalability issue, but their development is still tedious and time-consuming. In this work, we investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) models to facilitate knowledge transfer in an organizational context, leading to more cost-effective IT-based teaching systems. Through a systematic literature review, we examine key concepts, themes, and dimensions to better understand and design ML-based teaching systems. To do so, we capture and consolidate the capabilities of ML models in IT-based teaching systems, inductively analyze relevant concepts in this context, and determine their interrelationships. We present our findings in the form of a review of the key concepts, themes, and dimensions to understand and inform on ML-based teaching systems. Building on these results, our work contributes to research on computer-supported cooperative work by conceptualizing how ML-based teaching systems can preserve expert knowledge and facilitate its transfer from SMEs to human novices. In this way, we shed light on this emerging subfield of human-computer interaction and serve to build an interdisciplinary research agenda.",

      "abstract": "  The workflows of performing arts communities have been altered by the virtualization of typically in-person experiences, leading to shifts in performance venues and resulting in changes in expressivity and interaction. To investigate how virtualization processes affected the practice and conditions of performers and how they adapted to these changes, we interviewed 25 professional movement-based performers who have engaged in both live and online performances. We found that performers treated online performances akin to time-limited movie recordings without audience interaction. Instead of avoiding distanced venues, performers adapted to new limitations, inventing improvisation strategies in distraction-filled situations and using time and technical limitations as creative constraints. To examine how a distanced paradigm impacts dancers' live-action workflow, we conducted a performance involving a dancer interacting with a robot at a distant location. The case study showed that the performer altered her rehearsal strategies to work with distanced technology and adapted to the live interaction with a distanced audience by imagining unseen interactions. This work provides insights to guide the design of interactive technology for virtual performances to account for the adapting strategies performers are currently taking to overcome limitations in time, location, and lack of presence.",

      "abstract": "The phase ``online harms’’ has emerged in recent years out of a growing political willingness to address the ethical and social issues associated with the use of the internet and digital technology at large. The broad landscape that surrounds online harms gathers a multitude of disciplinary, sectoral and organizational efforts while raising myriad challenges and opportunities for the crossing entrenched boundaries. In this paper we draw lessons from a journey of co-creating a transdisciplinary knowledge infrastructure within a large research initiative animated by the online harms agenda. We begin with a reflection of the implications of mapping, taxonomizing and constructing knowledge infrastructures and a brief review of how online harm and adjacent themes have been theorized and classified in the literature to date. Grounded on our own experience of co-creating a map of online harms, we then argue that the map, and the process of mapping, performs three mutually constitutive functions, acting simultaneously as method, medium and provocation. We draw lessons from how an open-ended approach to mapping, despite not guaranteeing consensus, can foster productive debate and collaboration in ethically and politically fraught areas of research. We end with a call for CSCW research to surface and engage with the multiple temporalities, social lives and political sensibilities of knowledge infrastructures.",

In this paper, we synthesize and articulate these limitations through quantitative and qualitative analysis of 56 older adults interacting with a commercial CA deployed in their home for a 10 week period. We look at the CA as a compensatory technology in an older adult's care network. We argue that the CA limitations are rooted in the rigid cue-and-response style of task-oriented interactions common in CAs. We then propose a redesign for CA conversation flow to favor flexibility and personalization that is nonetheless viable within the limitations of current AI and machine learning technologies. We explore design tradeoffs to better support the usability needs of older adults compared to current design optimizations driven by efficiency and privacy goals.",

      "abstract": "Data portability–the capability to transfer one's data from one platform to another–has been described as an important tool for giving individuals more control over their data. It is defined in significant regulations such as the GDPR, and implemented by major online platforms. Unfortunately, there is a lack of research investigating internet users' perceptions and expectations of this technology in specific contexts, which is vital for building effective designs. One particularly important context for studying user perspectives is social media, since it is deeply embedded into daily life and is particularly complex regarding the value and portability of user data. This paper addresses that gap through a survey and interviews of social media users in the United States. We identify current attitudes and practices toward controlling their social media data, and examine participants' impressions about the extent to which data portability may enhance their control. Participants had generally favorable impressions, but had differing opinions about what forms of control are important and the extent to which those could be served by data portability. Based on the results, we propose future directions for improving users' control in the context of social media, such as fine-tuned filtering of data to be transferred and ways to coordinate transfers alongside social contacts.",

As the creator economy has risen in popularity, so have concerns of racism and discrimination on social media. Black content creators across multiple platforms have identified challenges with racism and discrimination, perpetuated by platform users, companies that collaborate with creators for sponsored content, and the algorithms governing these platforms. In this work, we provide a qualitative study of the experiences of Black content creators on one video-sharing platform, TikTok. We conduct 12 semi-structured interviews with Black TikTok content creators to understand their experiences, identify the challenges they face, and understand their perceptions of the platform. We find that some common challenges include: content moderation, monetization, harassment and bullying from viewers, lack of transparency of recommendation and filtering algorithms, and the perception that content from Black creators is treated unfairly by those algorithms. We then suggest design interventions to mitigate the challenges, bolster positive aspects, and overall cultivate an inclusive algorithmic experience for Black creators on TikTok.",

However, the greater emphasis on technology adoption is putting underserved minority business owners at greater risk of being left behind. We take an assets-based approach to understand the strengths and challenges business owners face in adopting and using digital technologies. We then implement a community-based intervention---Community Tech Workers (CTWs)---to bridge the growing socio-technical gap in the context of small businesses on Detroit’s Eastside. We take a mixed-methods approach, using a combination of a survey, interviews, and observations, to outline how the CTW program 1) helps businesses determine where to start with technology use, 2) offers support grounded in the day-to-day realities of running a business, and 3) builds caring relationships with business owners to foster trust in technology support services. We suggest opportunities for a more collective perspective to assets-based community development and outline considerations for building culturally-conscious ecosystems of support for digital engagement among underserved minority business owners.",

Prior work in the HCI and CSCW communities has focused on how social media can be vital during natural disasters; non-social media technologies have been under-researched. To understand how technology other than social media can support or harm people during crises, we explore hurricane survivors' *use and disuse* of multiple kinds of technologies in online surveys with 138 US participants. We find substantial technology use supporting survivors' comfort and safety *other than social media*. We also observe that designing technologies for high-resource environments--as with many mainstream apps--causes users to decrease use of potentially critical technologies during utility outages, which are common during hurricanes. With themes of both (a) broad technology use and (b) conditions preventing technology use, we make recommendations for technical design, policy, and research to empower communities susceptible to hurricanes.\r\n",

Digital interventions can create spaces that promote social inclusion and cohesion. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of a cultural heritage and digital storytelling application supporting a participatory approach to culture and hosting society. We evaluate our intervention in three marginalized communities with different social-cultural contexts: migrant women in Barcelona, a community living in a priority neighbourhood in Paris and second and third-generation migrants in Lisbon. Through an analysis of their application use, our findings point at their needs and desires, highlighting how the app can support social inclusion as the first step towards cohesion, but that these are heterogeneous concepts susceptible to nuanced appropriations by the different communities. \r\n",

      "abstract": "Sexist content is widespread on social media and can reduce women’s psychological well-being and their willingness to participate in online discourse, making it a societal issue. To counter these effects, social media platforms employ moderators. To date, little is known about the effectiveness of different forms of moderation in creating a safe space and their acceptance, in particular from the perspective of women as members of the targeted group and users in general (rather than perpetrators). In this research, we propose that some common forms of moderation can be systematized along two facets of visibility, namely visibility of sexist content and of counterspeech. In an online experiment (N = 839), we manipulated these two facets and tested how they shaped social norms, feelings of safety, and intent to participate, as well as fairness, trustworthiness, and efficacy evaluations. In line with our predictions, deletion of sexist content – i.e., its invisibility – and (public) counterspeech – i.e., its visibility – against visible sexist content contributed to creating a safe space. Looking at the underlying psychological mechanism, we found that these effects were largely driven by changes in what was perceived normative in the presented context. Interestingly, deletion of sexist content was judged as less fair than counterspeech against visible sexist content. Our research contributes to a growing body of literature that highlights the importance of norms in creating safer online environments and provides practical implications for moderators for selecting actions that can be effective and accepted.",

This paper describes a design exploration, implementation, and evaluation of Perspectives, a novel hybrid meeting system that aimed to create an inclusive and equitable space for hybrid meetings. Perspectives digitally composites everyone into a virtual room so that each person has a unique but spatially consistent viewpoint into the meeting. The user study compared Perspectives with three commercially available UX designs for hybrid meetings: Gallery, Together Mode, and Front Row. Results from this study revealed key benefits of Perspectives, including supporting natural interactions, creating a strong sense of co-presence, and reducing cognitive load. Results from the study also helped iterate on the design principles of Perspectives, which offer important insights on supporting hybrid meetings.",

Starting a new life can be unsettling for refugees and asylum seekers during the resettling process in their host countries, particularly when it comes to gaining financial independence. This paper used an interview-based study to engage with fifteen refugees and asylum seekers to learn how they achieve entrepreneurial success as they navigate refugee specific barriers in a new economy. The insights showed refugee entrepreneur specific barriers that align with resettlement challenges and the technical and social resourcefulness of this under-resourced community. Our contributions to the CSCW research community are an understanding of how low-socioeconomic entrepreneurs such as refugees, function in their ecosystem and design implications for developing technology to further the efforts of refugee entrepreneurs.",

      "abstract": "Short-form video sharing platforms (SVSPs) have recently seen a rapid increase in use rate, with many older adults actively creating and sharing videos on these platforms. This recent trend presents new evidence to counter the negative impression of older adults as passive recipients of online services, as well as opportunities for an in-depth understanding of why older adults become online contributors. To understand older adults' user trajectory on SVSPs, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 older adult content creators on two of the most popular SVSPs in China, DouYin and KuaiShou. We found our participants were initially drawn to SVSPs because of the low barrier to participation and fun, but they stayed mainly because of the attention and support they received there. SVSPs enabled a low-barrier and equitable platform through their near-automatic use and relatively equal opportunities for recommendations. Motivated by their own passion and the audience's support, our participants actively acquired new skills for better performance and became more deeply engaged on the platforms. Based on these findings, we reflect on how SVSPs' technical affordances support older adults' transitioning from lurkers to contributors. We advocate for the value of participation equity and a supportive environment for more inclusive social media platforms.",

      "abstract": "Technological scale and human care work are often seen as incompatible. Yet, seeking to address barriers to in-person care, governments and non-governmental organizations globally have been pushing for scaling remote care technologies such as chat- or phone-based helpdesks or telehealth systems that rely on care workers to engage with users. Despite theoretical tensions between care and scale and the essential role of care workers, workers' perspective on scale and its impact on care provision is rarely centered early on in decisions to scale. In this paper, we examine care and scale from the perspective of medical support executives (MSEs) who support a chat-based health information service for maternal and child health deployed across multiple states in India. We draw on interviews with MSEs, NGO staff who implement the service, and families who use the service, as well as speculative design sessions conducted with MSEs. We find that by centering MSEs' perspectives, we can differentiate between growth of the relationships and heterogeneity that enable social impact, versus scale-thinking that promotes the decontextualization of care. We leverage our findings to discuss implications for the design of remote care technologies, including the importance of place and human connection.",

      "abstract": "Prison and police abolition has become a major political philosophy in North American discourse following the 2020 George Floyd protests. The philosophy remains divisive and North American abolitionists seeking to coalition-build, provide resources for vulnerable populations, and garner public support continue to face challenges. We explore current usage of digital tools among abolitionists and the potential of a digital mapping tool to address these challenges. We conduct an interview study with 15 abolitionist organizations to understand activists’ perspectives on the value of digital tools for organizing and a content analysis of 25 existing digital tools that convey abolitionist ideas to the public. Our findings together reveal (1) opportunities for digital mapping and HCI to support abolitionist activism and grassroots activism more broadly and (2) the challenges of digitally representing a movement that is intentionally grassroots, covert, and often involves organizers working in disparate locations.",

As adolescents and young adults childhood cancer survivors age, they must transition and transfer their health care from their pediatric to an adult care institution. In this study, we provide empirical evidence reporting on the after-cancer treatment experiences of childhood cancer survivors through their transition. We report findings from 24 semi-structured interviews with adolescent and young adult cancer survivors participating in a childhood cancer survivorship program that prepares them for adult care. Our findings reveal three parts of their after-cancer treatment experience: the assumption of responsibility for their complex care needs and medical information and the overall transfer and maintenance of the continuity of their care to an adult clinician. Our findings suggest that survivors may play an essential yet unrecognized role in the patient hand-off. Thus, we introduce patient-mediate handoffs and suggest design opportunities.",

      "abstract": "Algorithm audits are powerful tools for studying black-box systems without direct knowledge of their inner workings. While very effective in examining technical components, the method stops short of a sociotechnical frame, which would also consider users themselves as an integral and dynamic part of the system. Addressing this limitation, we propose the concept of sociotechnical auditing: auditing methods that evaluate algorithmic systems at the sociotechnical level, focusing on the interplay between algorithms and users as each impacts the other. Just as algorithm audits probe an algorithm with varied inputs and observe outputs, a sociotechnical audit (STA) additionally probes users, exposing them to different algorithmic behavior and measuring their resulting attitudes and behaviors. As an example of this method, we develop Intervenr, a platform for conducting browser-based, longitudinal sociotechnical audits with consenting, compensated participants. Intervenr investigates the algorithmic content users encounter online, and also coordinates systematic client-side interventions to understand how users change in response. As a case study, we deploy Intervenr in a two-week sociotechnical audit of online advertising (N=244) to investigate the central premise that personalized ad targeting is more effective on users. In the first week, we observe and collect all browser ads delivered to users, and in the second, we deploy an ablation-style intervention that disrupts normal targeting by randomly pairing participants and swapping all their ads. We collect user-oriented metrics (self-reported ad interest and feeling of representation) and advertiser-oriented metrics (ad views, clicks, and recognition) throughout, along with a total of over 500,000 ads. Our STA finds that targeted ads indeed perform better with users, but also that users begin to acclimate to different ads in only a week, casting doubt on the primacy of personalized ad targeting given the impact of repeated exposures. In comparison with other evaluation methods that only study technical components, or only experiment on users, sociotechnical audits evaluate sociotechnical systems through the interplay of their technical and human components.",

In turn, workers shape the materiality of data through different data-oriented activities. In this paper, we draw on theory of data journeys to develop and present a conceptual framework of four data-intensive activities: Producing, mobilising, processing, and re-purposing. Together, those activities capture entanglements of data transformations and data-intensive practices. We develop the framework through a qualitative study of digitisation in Environmental Assessment (EA) practice. Through ten semi-structured and two interactive interviews, EA practitioners reflect on their experiences working with digital environmental data. The paper offers two main contributions. First, we develop a data journey theoretical framework and show that it is useful as a unit of analysis for uncovering tensions in data-oriented activities. Second, we use these insights to outline a set of tensions for future design activities in the area of data work practices.",

      "abstract": "With the heightened digitization of the workplace, alongside the rise of remote and hybrid work prompted by the pandemic, there is growing corporate interest in using passive sensing technologies for workplace wellbeing. Existing research on these technologies often focus on understanding or improving interactions between an individual user and the technology. Workplace settings can, however, introduce a range of complexities that challenge the potential impact and in-practice desirability of wellbeing sensing technologies. Today, there is an inadequate empirical understanding of how everyday workers---including those who are impacted by, and impact the deployment of workplace technologies--envision its broader socio-ecological impacts. In this study, we conduct storyboard-driven interviews with 33 participants across three stakeholder groups: organizational governors, AI builders, and worker data subjects. Overall, our findings surface how workers envisioned wellbeing sensing technologies may lead to cascading impacts on their broader organizational culture, interpersonal relationships with colleagues, and individual day-to-day lives. Participants anticipated harms arising from ambiguity and misalignment around scaled notions of ``worker wellbeing,'' underlying technical limitations to workplace-situated sensing, and assumptions regarding how social structures and relationships may shape the impacts and use of these technologies. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for designing worker-centered data-driven wellbeing technologies. ",

      "abstract": "With rapid advances in computing, we are beginning to see the expansion of technology into domains far afield from traditional office settings historically at the center of CSCW research. Manufacturing is one industry undergoing a new phase of digital transformation. Shop-floor workers are being equipped with tools to deliver efficiency and support data-driven decision making. To understand how these kinds of technologies are affecting the nature of work, we conducted a 15-month qualitative study of the digitalization of the shipping and receiving department at a small manufacturer located in the Southeastern United States. Our findings provide an in-depth understanding of how the norms and values of factory floor workers shape their perception and adoption of computing services designed to augment their work. We highlight how emerging technologies are creating a new class of hybrid workers and point to the social and human elements that need to be considered to preserve meaningful work for blue-collar professionals.

      "abstract": "How can online communities execute a focused vision for their space? Curation offers one approach, where community leaders manually select content to share with the community. Curation enables leaders to shape a space that matches their taste, norms, and values, but the practice is often intractable at social media scale: curators cannot realistically sift through hundreds or thousands of submissions daily. In this paper, we contribute algorithmic and interface foundations enabling curation at scale, and manifest these foundations in a system called \\textit{Cura}. Our approach draws on the observation that, while curators' attention is limited, other community members' upvotes are plentiful and informative of curators' likely opinions. We thus contribute a transformer-based curation model that predicts whether each curator will upvote a post based on previous community upvotes. Cura applies this curation model to create a feed of content that it predicts the curator would want in the community. Evaluations demonstrate that the curation model accurately estimates opinions of diverse curators, that changing curators for a community results in clearly recognizable shifts in the community's content, and that, consequently, curation can reduce anti-social behavior by half without extra moderation effort. By sampling different types of curators, Cura lowers the threshold to genres of curated social media ranging from editorial groups to stakeholder roundtables to democracies.",

      "abstract": "The file, as a means of sharing structured information across time and place, has spanned centuries of ICTs. Despite much CSCW research on file management practices in organizational desktop computing settings, little research has examined how files are managed and shared using mobile devices. Our research asks, how do mobile phones and mobile applications impact the personal information management (PIM) practices involving files for young adults? In this interview and task observation study, we examined the file management practices of mobile phone users (N=25), both Android and iOS owners who use the superapp WhatsApp. Superapps like WeChat and WhatsApp are increasingly characterized as technology of life for the majority world, particularly among mobile-first users. We find that many grammars of action related to managing digital files in personal computing and email contexts persist, but participants’ sharing practices are influenced by media ideologies of friends, family, colleagues; and that their file management practices are shaped by the affordances of WhatsApp, as well as mobile operating systems and device hardware constraints. These results will be useful to researchers examining collective PIM practices; mobile communication practices between users and businesses via messaging apps; and theories of personal information practices related to the sharing and storage of digital files among mobile-first cohorts who increasingly share and access information via platforms and mobile applications.",

      "abstract": "Community voice is widely used in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) work with under-served communities, however, the term is unresolved denoting disparate activities, methods, and phenomena that are at their most useful when combined. We argue for a rethink by setting out a more nuanced understanding of `community' and `voice'. Building on our own experiences of HCI for Development (HCI4D) work and existing literature, we put forward a framework for the benefits it can bring to those who actively engage communities as part of their work. This framework can be understood in terms of its four constituent benefits for CSCW and HCI4D practitioners: (i) understanding context, (ii) creating empathy, (iii) leveraging local skills and knowledge, and (iv) building trust and buy-in. We reflect on how an improved understanding of these benefits applies to three prior projects with women living in Bangladesh and discuss the issues and need for more work on community voice. Finally, we discuss how this more detailed perspective on community voice helps us understand power dynamics and poly-vocal communities in development contexts. ",

      "abstract": "Moderators are at the core of maintaining healthy online communities. For these moderators, who are often volunteers from the community, filtering through content and responding to misbehavior on time has become increasingly challenging as online communities continue to grow. To address such challenges of scale, recent research has looked into designing better tools for moderators of various platforms (e.g. Reddit, Twitch, Facebook, and Twitter).\r\nIn this paper, we focus on Discord, a platform where communities are typically involved in large, synchronous group chats, creating an environment with a faster pace and a lack of structure compared to previously studied platforms. To tackle the unique challenges presented by Discord, we developed a new human-AI system called ConvEx for exploring online conversations.\r\nConvEx is an AI-augmented version of the standard Discord interface designed to help moderators be proactive in identifying and preventing potential problems. It provides visual embeddings of conversational metrics, such as activity and toxicity levels, and can be extended to visualize other metrics.\r\nThrough a user study with eight active moderators of Discord servers, we found that ConvEx supported several high-level strategies in monitoring a server and analyzing conversations. ConvEx allowed moderators to obtain a holistic view of activity across multiple channels on the server while guiding their attention towards problematic conversations and messages in a channel, helping them identify important contextual information to obtain reliable information from the AI analysis while also being able to pick up on contextual nuances which the AI missed. We conclude with design considerations for integrating AI into future interfaces for moderating synchronous, unstructured online conversations.",

At present, there is a pressing need to synthesize and extract key insights from prior literature in order to formulate a systematic understanding of what constitutes a moderation experience and to explore how such understanding could further moderation-related research and practice. To answer this question, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify and analyze 42 empirical articles published between January 2016 and March 2022. We describe these studies’ characteristics, characterize user experiences with moderation systems, and identify primary perspectives to conceptualize moderation experience. These findings suggest an expansive scope of research interests in understanding moderation experiences and considering moderated users as an important stakeholder group to reflect on current moderation design but also pertain to the dominance of the punitive, solutionist logic in moderation and ample implications for future moderation research, design, and practice.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, industry leaders and researchers have proposed to use technical provenance standards to address visual misinformation spread through digitally altered media. By adding immutable and secure provenance information such as authorship and edit date to media metadata, social media users could potentially better assess the validity of the media they encounter. However, it is unclear how end users would respond to provenance information, or how to best design provenance indicators to be understandable to laypeople. We conducted an online experiment with 595 participants from the US and UK to investigate how provenance information altered users' accuracy perceptions and trust in visual content shared on social media. We found that provenance information often lowered trust and caused users to doubt deceptive media, particularly when it revealed that the media was composited. We additionally tested conditions where the provenance information itself was shown to be incomplete or invalid, and found that these states have a significant impact on participants' accuracy perceptions and trust in media, leading them, in some cases, to disbelieve honest media. Our findings show that provenance, although enlightening, is still not a concept well-understood by users, who confuse media credibility with the orthogonal (albeit related) concept of provenance credibility. We discuss how design choices may contribute to provenance (mis)understanding, and conclude with implications for usable provenance systems, including clearer interfaces and user education.",

      "abstract": "The workplace has experienced extensive digital transformation, in part due to artificial intelligence's commercial availability. Though still an emerging technology, emotional artificial intelligence (EAI) is increasingly incorporated into enterprise systems to augment and automate organizational decisions and to monitor and manage workers. EAI use is often celebrated for its potential to improve workers' wellbeing and performance as well as address organizational problems such as bias and safety. Workers subject to EAI in the workplace are data subjects whose data make EAI possible and who are most impacted by it. However, we lack empirical knowledge about data subjects' perspectives on EAI, including in the workplace. To this end, using a relational ethics lens, we qualitatively analyzed 395 U.S. adults' open-ended survey (partly representative) responses regarding the perceived benefits and risks they associate with being subjected to EAI in the workplace. While participants acknowledged potential benefits of being subject to EAI (e.g., employers using EAI to aid their wellbeing, enhance their work environment, reduce bias), a myriad of potential risks overshadowed perceptions of potential benefits. Participants expressed concerns regarding the potential for EAI use to harm their wellbeing, work environment and employment status, and create and amplify bias and stigma against them, especially the most marginalized (e.g., along dimensions of race, gender, mental health status, disability). Distrustful of EAI and its potential risks, participants anticipated conforming to (e.g., partaking in emotional labor) or refusing (e.g., quitting a job) EAI implementation in practice. We argue that EAI may magnify, rather than alleviate, existing challenges data subjects face in the workplace and suggest that some EAI-inflicted harms would persist even if concerns of EAI's accuracy and bias are addressed.

We created \"Deliberating with AI\", a web tool that enables people to create and evaluate ML models in order to examine strengths and shortcomings of past decision-making and deliberate on how to improve future decisions. We apply this tool to a context of people selection, having stakeholders---decision makers (faculty) and decision subjects (students)---use the tool to improve graduate school admission decisions. Through our case study, we demonstrate how the stakeholders used the web tool to create ML models that they used as boundary objects to deliberate over organization decision-making practices.

Intelligent systems might be designed to support 1-to-many coaching but designing such systems requires a 1-to-many coaching model that details novices’ challenges, coaches’ strategies, and coaches’ goals. To build such a model, we conducted interaction analysis on 24 1-to-many coaching sessions with novices developing new products in a university incubator and conducted retrospective analyses with 3 coaches and 30 novices.  We contribute a model that demonstrates that coaches in a 1-to-many setting not only need to help novices develop metacognitive skills (just as in 1-to-1 coaching), but also need to utilize the presence and expertise of a group of novices to learn from each other, to mitigate their fear of failures, and provide them accountability. Our model informs design implications for future intelligent coaching systems to (1) assist coaches in monitoring, comparing, and accessing many novices’ progress, learning, and expertise; (2) provide novices with checklists, templates, and scaffolds to help them self-evaluate, seek-help, and summarize learning; (3) showcase failures and growth; and (4) publicize planning and progress to support accountability.",

Current peer evaluation tools have also yet to address the unique opportunities that online collaborative technologies provide for addressing these biases. In this work, we explore the potential of one such opportunity for peer evaluations: data traces automatically generated by collaborative tools, which we refer to as “activity traces”. We conducted a between-subjects experiment with 101 students and MTurk workers, investigating the effects of reviewing activity traces on peer evaluations of team members in an online collaborative task. Our findings show that the usage of activity traces led participants to make more and greater revisions to their evaluations compared to a control condition. These revisions also increased the consistency and participants' perceived accuracy of the evaluations that they received. Our findings demonstrate the value of activity traces as an approach for performing more reliable and objective peer evaluations of teamwork. Based on our findings as well as qualitative analysis of free-form responses in our study, we also identify and discuss key considerations and design recommendations for incorporating activity traces into real-world peer evaluation systems.

      "abstract": "Sharing multimedia content, without obtaining consent from the people involved causes multiparty privacy conflicts (MPCs). However, social-media platforms do not proactively protect users from the occurrence of MPCs. Hence, users resort to out-of-band, informal communication channels, attempting to mitigate such conflicts. So far, previous works have focused on hard interventions that do not adequately consider the contextual factors (e.g., social norms, cognitive priming) or are employed too late (i.e., the content has already been seen). In this work, we investigate the potential of conversational agents as a medium for negotiating and mitigating MPCs. We designed MediationBot, a mediator chatbot that encourages consent collection, enables users to explain their points of view, and proposes solutions to finding a middle ground. We evaluated our design using a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with 𝑁 = 32 participants, where we found that MediationBot can effectively help participants to reach an agreement and to prevent MPCs. It produced a structured conversation where participants had well-clarified speaking turns. Overall, our participants found MediationBot to be supportive as it proposes useful middle-ground solutions. Our work informs the future design of mediator agents to support social-media users against MPCs.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted countries around the world to introduce smartphone apps to support disease control efforts. Their purposes range from digital contact tracing to quarantine enforcement to vaccination passports, and their effectiveness often depends on widespread adoption. While previous work has identified factors that promote or hinder adoption, it has typically examined data collected at a single point in time or focused exclusively on digital contact tracing apps. In this work, we conduct the first representative study that examines changes in people’s attitudes towards COVID-19-related smartphone apps for five different purposes over the first 1.5 years of the pandemic. In three survey rounds conducted between Summer 2020 and Summer 2021 in the United States and Germany, with approximately 1,000 participants per round and country, we investigate people’s willingness to use such apps, their perceived utility, and people’s attitudes towards them in different stages of the pandemic. Our results indicate that privacy is a consistent concern for participants, even in a public health crisis, and the collection of identity-related data significantly decreases acceptance of COVID-19 apps. Trust in authorities is essential to increase confidence in government-backed apps and foster citizens’ willingness to contribute to crisis management. There is a need for continuous communication with app users to emphasize the benefits of health crisis apps both for individuals and society, thus counteracting decreasing willingness to use them and perceived usefulness as the pandemic evolves.",

      "abstract": "During interpersonal interactions, conversational moves can help people establish common ground—a shared frame of reference to support communication. Neurodiverse conversation dyads that include autistic and non-autistic members can experience challenges in creating and maintaining such a shared frame of reference due to differing communication and cognitive styles. We conducted a design study to understand conversational patterns among neurodiverse dyads and then used those patterns to co-design concepts for supporting the creation and maintenance of common ground by those conversation pairs. Our study involved two activities with participants: (1) a paired interview with autistic adults and a trusted conversation partner that used a novel swimlane visual elicitation activity, and (2) a remote design study during which the autistic participants designed a game intended to visualize and support neurodiverse conversation dynamics.  We found that communication technology can scaffold neurodiverse dyads in locating common ground by supporting crucial individual and joint decision-making; clarification of language and emotions; and embodied sense-making of identity, relationships, and shared information. This project generated insights related to two distinct aspects of designing assistive Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to support autistic individuals: (1) the ability for visual elicitation activities to help autistic individuals recognize interaction patterns, gain a deeper understanding of other's perspectives, and imagine more desirable alternatives, and (2) the importance of recognizing and supporting multi-dimensional aspects of communication practices (i.e., social, emotional, sensory) in establishing and maintaining shared points of reference for neurodiverse conversation dyads.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on makerspace practices that can hinder or enable access for under-resourced women of colour who are novices to making, predominantly migrants and refugee women. We report on a 21 month long ethnographic fieldwork at nine makerspaces across two metropolitan Australian cities. The findings present barriers and opportunities around access of under-resourced women of colour into makerspaces that encode or decode their exclusion. We present these findings through four themes: first impressions and visual representations; dimensions of the enabling environment; role of community partnerships; and intersectional identities of women. We conclude by discussing three contributions this paper makes to the HCI and CSCW literature, with supporting lessons and recommendations so that makerspaces no longer encode the involvement of only certain types of users (predominantly well-educated white males or white females), to the exclusion of women at the intersectional margins. If makerspaces can facilitate an enabling environment appropriate to be inclusive of women who face intersecting oppressions, the benefits of the maker movement can expand substantially. ",

      "abstract": "Online platforms for freelancing allow teams performing complex work to be assembled in a matter of minutes and dispersed nearly as quickly. With such short time frames, \\rev{ad hoc} and virtual teams have few opportunities to learn strategies and effective team practices to work with their colleagues. \r\n  Without such practices, teams are prone to work sub-optimally and lack direction. One key challenge in virtual teams discovering effective team practices is that because \\fix{the} practices \\fix{ought to} involve situated knowledge, \\fix{it takes} time to coalesce, as team members learn about each other over time. \r\n  \r\n  This work introduces a \\Sys{}, that \\rev{ad hoc} teams can use to reflect collaboratively and reinforce effective \\fix{team} practices. Our interface accelerates \\rev{the discovery of} practices \\rev{in situ} and then guides them in reinforcing and applying these practices to future tasks. We conducted a between-subjects experiment (N=51) to assess our design with crowdworkers from the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. This randomized controlled experiment showed that teams using our system for approximately six minutes of collaborative reflection were able to discover effective practices more successfully and had significantly improved team performance and viability. These results indicate that deliberate support for improving team practices can improve outcomes even through very short interaction. We conclude with design implications and opportunities for future work.",

      "abstract": "Though current conversations around automated content moderation often focus on newer contexts for this technology such as harassment or misinformation, one other important use case is copyright detection systems such as YouTube’s Content ID. This context for content removals online has some unique properties such as its relationship to legal requirements (Section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that governs copyright notice-and-takedown), and provides a longstanding example of the intersection between policy, online platform design, and algorithms. Based on qualitative analysis of survey data, this paper examines the impact of DMCA takedowns and automated copyright-related content removals on a community of content creators who primarily share transformative works, remixed content that makes use of copyrighted material. Our data reveals patterns of chilling effects related to prior experiences and perceptions of policies and process. Based on these findings we make recommendations for platform policy and design, education, and advocacy, and discuss the implications of our findings for current and proposed laws.",

As a result, less is understood about the challenges that people with disabilities face in obtaining technology in the first place and how they work around these challenges. We reduce this gap by examining the technology access challenges of people with visual impairments in India in the context of digital banking. Through a qualitative study consisting of 30 interviews, we find that participants routinely encountered social and technical challenges that made it difficult to access and use digital banking. To address these challenges, people with visual impairments engaged in advocacy work which consisted of five dimensions: 1) creating awareness, 2) demonstrating competence, 3) escalation, 4) gathering support, and 5) seeking sighted help. We expand on the idea of advocacy as a form of access work performed by people with visual impairments to secure and maintain access to digital banking.  ",

      "abstract": "Online fandom communities (OFCs) provide a convenient space for fans to create, collect, and discuss the content of their mutual interest (e.g., music artists). Real-world events could frequently attract outsiders to join OFCs, providing both the opportunity to expand the fan base and challenges to manage the community. However, it is unclear that how influxes of newcomers would influence the development of OFCs and what user behaviors may be correlated with their future engagement. To fill this gap, we took the music OFCs as the focus, and quantitatively analyzed user behaviors and their correlations with users’ future engagement in the community. Results suggested that 1) event-induced newcomers expressed more hate speech and negative sentiment, praised less celebrity-related content (e.g., song, album), and interacted with narrower cohorts than existing members; 2) Although existing members tended to receive more upvotes during the events than before and after the events, newcomers showed an opposite trend; 3) keeping users’ activeness, expressing positive sentiments, and having diverse interactions during periods of influx were helpful when maintaining members’ future levels of engagement. This work deepened the understanding of fan behaviors in the dynamic period, and we discussed how our insights could benefit OFCs.",

      "abstract": "Instagram, one of the most popular social media platforms among youth, has recently come under scrutiny for potentially being harmful to the safety and well-being of our younger generations. Automated approaches for risk detection may be one way to help mitigate some of these risks if such algorithms are both accurate and contextual to the types of online harms youth face on social media platforms. However, the imminent switch by Instagram to end-to-end encryption will limit the type of data that will be available to the platform to detect and mitigate such risks. In this paper, we investigate which indicators are most helpful in automatically detecting risk in Instagram private conversations, with an eye on high-level metadata, which will still be available in the scenario of end-to-end encryption. Toward this end, we collected Instagram data from 172 youth (ages 13-21) and asked them to identify private message conversations that made them feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Our participants risk-flagged 28,725 conversations that contained 4,181,970 direct messages, including textual posts and images. Based on this rich and multimodal dataset, we tested multiple feature sets (metadata, linguistic cues, and image features) and trained classifiers to detect risky conversations. Overall, we found that the metadata features (e.g., conversation length, a proxy for participant engagement) were the best predictors of risky conversations. However, for distinguishing between risk types, the different linguistic and media cues were the best predictors. Based on our findings, we provide design implications for AI risk detection systems in the presence of end-to-end encryption. More broadly, our work contributes to the literature on adolescent online safety by moving toward more robust solutions for risk detection that directly takes into account the lived risk experiences of youth.",

      "abstract": "Social media platforms disseminate extensive volumes of online content, including true and, in particular, false rumors. Previous literature has studied the diffusion of offline rumors, yet more research is needed to understand the diffusion of online rumors. In this paper, we examine the role of lifetime and crowd effects in social media sharing behavior for true vs. false rumors. Based on 126,301 Twitter cascades, we find that the sharing behavior is characterized by lifetime and crowd effects that explain differences in the spread of true as opposed to false rumors. All else equal, we find that a longer lifetime is associated with less sharing activities, yet the reduction in sharing is larger for false than for true rumors. Hence, lifetime is an important determinant explaining why false rumors die out. Furthermore, we find that the spread of false rumors is characterized by herding tendencies (rather than collective intelligence), whereby the spread of false rumors becomes proliferated at a larger cascade depth. These findings explain differences in the diffusion dynamics of true and false rumors and further offer practical implications for social media platforms.",

      "abstract": "Social media platforms curate access to information and opportunities, and so play a critical role in shaping public discourse today. The opaque nature of the algorithms these platforms use to curate content raises societal questions. Prior studies have used black-box methods led by experts or collaborative audits driven by everyday users to show that these algorithms can lead to biased or discriminatory outcomes. However, existing auditing methods face fundamental limitations because they function independent of the platforms. Concerns of potential harmful outcomes have prompted proposal of legislation in both the U.S. and the E.U. to mandate a new form of auditing where vetted external researchers get privileged access to social media platforms. Unfortunately, to date there have been no concrete technical proposals to provide such auditing, because auditing at scale risks disclosure of users' private data and platforms' proprietary algorithms. We propose a new method for platform-supported auditing that can meet the goals of the proposed legislation. The first contribution of our work is to enumerate these challenges and the limitations of existing auditing methods to implement these policies at scale. Second, we suggest that limited, privileged access to relevance estimators is the key to enabling generalizable platform-supported auditing of social media platforms by external researchers. Third, we show platform-supported auditing need not risk user privacy nor disclosure of platforms' business interests by proposing an auditing framework that protects against these risks. For a particular fairness metric, we show that ensuring privacy imposes only a small constant factor increase (6.34x as an upper bound, and 4x for typical parameters) in the number of samples required for accurate auditing. Our technical contributions, combined with ongoing legal and policy efforts, can enable public oversight into how social media platforms affect individuals and society by moving past the privacy-vs-transparency hurdle.",

      "abstract": "Fueled by internet-of-things technologies and spanning a wide range of sensors, speakers, and cameras, smart homes promise to make our lives easier and automate routine tasks. From smart speakers to security cameras, these devices answer our questions, monitor our home environment, and conserve energy. They also collect significant data, ranging from on/off commands to audio and video data, and they do this in some of our most private spaces. In this paper, we explore the privacy risks associated with smart home technology by focusing on privacy-conscious smart home power users—those who spend significant time and money to research, install, and integrate devices throughout their homes and engage in advanced device and network management strategies to mitigate their privacy concerns. Drawing on data from 10 focus groups with 32 privacy-conscious power users, we identify the key privacy risks they perceive from this technology, as well as how they mitigate those risks through increasingly complex strategies. Our findings reveal that navigating the technical landscape that makes up the smart home environment—including what data is collected, what options are available for managing or restricting data flows, and who has access to data collected by smart devices—is complex and often confusing, even for people who spend significant time researching devices and integration options. We use these findings to argue for further development of tools that are transparent, easy to use, and aligned with the privacy needs of a diverse userbase.",

      "abstract": "The spread of misinformation on social media is a pressing societal problem that platforms, policymakers, and researchers continue to grapple with. As a countermeasure, recent works have proposed to employ non-expert fact-checkers in the crowd to fact-check social media content. While experimental studies suggest that crowds might be able to accurately assess the veracity of social media content, an understanding of how crowd fact-checked (mis-)information spreads is missing. In this work, we empirically analyze the spread of misleading vs. not misleading community fact-checked posts on social media. For this purpose, we employ a dataset of community-created fact-checks from Twitter's \"Birdwatch'' pilot and map them to resharing cascades on Twitter. Different from earlier studies analyzing the spread of misinformation listed on third-party fact-checking websites (e.g., snopes.com), we find that community fact-checked misinformation is less viral. Specifically, misleading posts are estimated to receive 36.62% fewer retweets than not misleading posts.\r\nA partial explanation may lie in differences in the fact-checking targets: community fact-checkers tend to fact-check posts from influential user accounts with many followers, while expert fact-checks tend to target posts that are shared by less influential users. We further find that there are significant differences in virality across different sub-types of misinformation (e.g., factual errors, missing context, manipulated media). Moreover, we conduct a user study to assess the perceived reliability of (real-world) community-created fact-checks. Here, we find that users, to a large extent, agree with community-created fact-checks. \r\nAltogether, our findings offer insights into how misleading vs. not misleading posts spread and highlight the crucial role of sample selection when studying misinformation on social media.",

      "abstract": "Claims of election fraud throughout the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election and during the lead up to the January 6, 2021 insurrection attempt have drawn attention to the urgent need to better understand how people interpret and act on disinformation. In this work, we present three primary contributions: (1) a framework for understanding the interaction between participatory disinformation and informal and tactical mobilization; (2) three case studies from the 2020 U.S. election analyzed using detailed temporal, content, and thematic analysis; and (3) a qualitative coding scheme for understanding how digital disinformation functions to mobilize online audiences. We combine resource mobilization theory with previous work examining participatory disinformation campaigns and \"deep stories\" to show how false or misleading information functioned to mobilize online audiences before, during, and after election day. Our analysis highlights how users on Twitter collaboratively construct and amplify alleged evidence of fraud that is used to facilitate action, both online and off. We find that mobilization is dependent on the selective amplification of false or misleading tweets by influencers, the framing around those claims, as well as the perceived credibility of their source. These processes are a self-reinforcing cycle where audiences collaborate in the construction of a misleading version of reality, which in turn leads to offline actions that are used to further reinforce a manufactured reality. Through this work, we hope to better inform future interventions.",

      "abstract": "Live streaming has become a popular activity world-wide that has warranted research attention on its privacy related issues. For instance, bystanders' privacy, or the privacy of third-parties captured by streamers, has been increasingly studied as live streaming has become almost ubiquitous in both public and private spaces in many countries. While prior work has studied bystanders' privacy concerns, a gap exists in understanding how streamers consider bystanders' privacy and the steps they take (or do not take) to preserve it. Understanding streamers' considerations towards bystanders' privacy is vital because streamers are the ones who have direct control over whether and how bystanders' information is disclosed. To address this gap, we conducted an interview study with 25 Chinese streamers to understand their considerations and practices regarding bystanders' privacy in live streaming. We found that streamers cared about bystanders' privacy and evaluated possible privacy violations to bystanders from several perspectives. To protect bystanders from privacy violations, streamers primarily relied on technical, behavioral, and collaborative strategies. Our results also indicated that current streaming platforms lacked features that helped streamers seamlessly manage bystanders' privacy and involved bystanders into their privacy decision-making. Applying the theoretical lens of collective privacy management, we discuss implications for the design of live streaming systems to support streamers in protecting bystanders' privacy.",

We propose the Newcomer Homepage, a central place where newcomers can learn how peer production works and find opportunities to contribute, as a solution for attracting and retaining newcomers. The homepage was built upon existing research and designed in collaboration with partner communities. Through a large-scale controlled experiment spanning 27 non-English Wikipedia wikis, we evaluate the homepage and find modest gains, and that having a positive effect on the newcomer experience depends on the newcomer's context. We discuss how this impacts interventions that aim to improve the newcomer experience in peer production communities.",

      "abstract": "Just as other disciplines, the humanities explore how computational research approaches and tools can meaningfully contribute to scholarly knowledge production. Building on related work from the areas of CSCW and HCI, we approach the design of computational tools through the analytical lens of `human-AI collaboration.' Such work investigates how human competencies and computational capabilities can be effectively and meaningfully combined. However, there is no generalizable concept of what constitutes `meaningful' human-AI collaboration. In terms of genuinely human competencies, we consider criticality and reflection as guiding principles of scholarly knowledge production and as deeply embedded in the methodologies and practices of the humanities. Although (designing for) reflection is a recurring topic in CSCW and HCI discourses, it has not been centered in work on human-AI collaboration. We posit that integrating both concepts is a viable approach to supporting `meaningful' human-AI collaboration in the humanities and other qualitative, interpretivist, and hermeneutic research areas. Our research, thus, is guided by the question of how critical reflection can be enabled in human-AI collaboration. We address this question with a use case that centers on computer vision (CV) tools for art historical image retrieval. Specifically, we conducted a qualitative interview study with art historians to explore a) what potentials and affordances art historians ascribe to human-AI collaboration and CV in particular, and b) in what ways art historians conceptualize critical reflection in the context of human-AI collaboration. We extended the interviews with a think-aloud software exploration. We observed and recorded our participants' interaction with a ready-to-use CV tool in a possible research scenario. We found that critical reflection, indeed, constitutes a core prerequisite for `meaningful' human-AI collaboration in humanities research contexts. However, we observed that critical reflection was not fully realized during interaction with the CV tool. We interpret this divergence as supporting our hypothesis that computational tools need to be intentionally designed in such a way that they actively scaffold and support critical reflection during interaction. Based on our findings, we suggest four empirically grounded design implications for `critical-reflective human-AI collaboration': supporting reflection on the basis of transparency, foregrounding epistemic presumptions, emphasizing the situatedness of data, and strengthening interpretability through contextualized explanations.",

In this paper, we argue that it is time to take stock of digital legacy scholarship, examining what we know, what gaps remain, and what areas are imperative for future work. Through a Grounded Theory Literature Review (GTLR), we identify four foci in digital legacy research to date: how identity is navigated in the passing of digital legacy, how digital legacies are engaged with, how digital legacies are put to rest, and how technology interfaces with offline legacy technologies. Based on our analysis, we present a model depicting how digital legacy research examines a lifecycle of data as it is passed down. This model identifies that digital legacy data moves through three stages: encoding, accessing, and dispossessing. The model illustrates gaps in current research and charts possible inflection points for future social computing research. Specifically, we highlight the importance of multi-user and multi-generational networks of people in end-of-life scenarios. Additionally, the model exhibits emerging theoretical findings and major concepts in the nascent field of digital legacy research. ",

Previous research has suggested that developers face several systemic challenges in designing apps that prioritise children's best interests. To understand how developers can be better supported, we used a Research through Design (RtD) method to explore what the future of privacy-friendly app development could look like. We performed an elicitation study with 20 children's app developers to understand their needs and requirements. We found a number of specific technical requirements from the participants about how they would like to be supported, such as having actionable transnational design guidelines and easy-to-use development libraries. However, participants were reluctant to adopt these design ideas in their development practices due to perceived financial risks associated with increased privacy in apps. To overcome this critical gap, participants formulated socio-technical requirements that extend to other stakeholders in the mobile industry, including parents and marketplaces. Our findings provide important immediate and long-term design opportunities for the HCI community, and indicate that support for changing app developers' practices must be designed in the context of their relationship with other stakeholders.",

      "abstract": "Research on smart home monitoring for older adults has predominantly focused on systems whose data and alerts are directed towards family members, caregivers, or healthcare providers. Older adults have expressed interest in engaging with these systems by seeing and using their data, but they are often limited to a passive role as subjects of monitoring. This paper presents qualitative results of a longitudinal smart home project with older adults living independently in the community. Based on interviews conducted throughout the 2.5-year study with 12 participants, we report on their lived experiences of having the monitoring system in their homes and on how they reflected on the data collected by the system. The results show how participants were able to extract meaningful information from the monitoring data without finding the system invasive or intrusive. Specifically, older adults exhibited interest in data that they found indicative of living an active lifestyle, such as time spent outside the home. Drawing from critical literature on active aging, we discuss implications for incorporating peer comparisons to support reflection on personal health data without reinforcing a deficit narrative of aging.",

Dysfunctional and biased meetings create negative psychological outcomes for employees, permeating the larger organization. Given widespread adoption of video conferencing (VC) software as a site for workplace meetings, we ask \\textit{how do existing VC tools contribute to increasing or reducing workplace bias in meetings?} We conducted a semi-structured interview study with 22 professionals to ask about bias and barriers to participation in their VC-mediated workplace meetings. We found that VC features push meeting leaders to exercise control over various meeting parameters, affecting both whether and how others participate and giving meeting leaders excess responsibility in mitigating or exacerbating bias in meetings. We demonstrate this with regards to four core VC features---user video tiles, raise hand, text-based chat, and meeting recording---and present recommendations for VC technology to democratize meeting control and reduce bias.",

      "abstract": "Unlike most other forms of coordinated, inauthentic behavior occurring online, the goals of state-sponsored information operations, or SSIOs, are often complex and multifaceted. These goals range from flooding conversations with a certain narrative, to increasing the public’s engagement with news sources of questionable quality, to stoking tensions between ideologically opposed groups to weaken public trust. The prevailing theoretical framework for understanding SSIOs is to treat them as a social botnet: a behaviorally homogeneous cluster of coordinated activity. However, the social bot framework is both at odds with some of the behaviors observed in early SSIOs and more broadly with the wide swathe of goals these operations set out to accomplish. To examine the fit of the social bot framework in the SSIO context, we develop a novel bag-of-words based method for clustering and describing user activity traces. Applying this method to a comprehensive repository of SSIOs conducted on Twitter over the last decade, we find that SSIOs violate both the core assumption of the social bot framework, and how it is operationalized in practical work. Instead, we find that SSIOs exhibit a clear division of labor and propose cooperative work with social roles as a more effective theoretical framework for understanding SSIOs. Through applying this framework, we find that the roles that SSIO agents take on have become more stable and simple over time, which holds substantial implications for developing methods for detection of these operations in the wild.",

Understanding how clinicians experience delays can lead to improved alert designs to increase delay awareness and mitigation. In this paper, we present the findings from an iterative user-centered design process involving 48 clinicians to develop a prototype alert system for supporting delay awareness in complex medical teamwork such as trauma resuscitation. We used semi-structured interviews and card-sorting workshops to identify the most common delays and elicit design requirements for the prototype alert system. We then conducted a survey to refine the alert designs, followed by near-live, video-guided simulations to investigate clinicians’ reactions to the alerts. We contribute to CSCW by designing a prototype alert system to support delay awareness in time-critical, complex teamwork and identifying four mechanisms through which teams mitigate delays.",

Fostering meaningful communication among generations is one way to avoid age segregation and dismantle associated biases. This paper presents a case analysis of an age-integrated online community (r/AskOldPeople) with an in-depth analysis of the most popular types of questions as well as the types of discussions within this community. Using content analysis of the top 999 posts, we describe the exchanges between different generations in this community, with people sharing experiences and perspectives, seeking advice, reminiscing about the past, and engaging in community building. Using thematic analysis of the same corpus, we also identified four themes characterizing the types of discussions prompted by the questions. We find that younger and older generations use the community to learn about experiences of the past, co-navigate psychosocial challenges across the lifespan, understand and commiserate about aging, and collectively make sense of crises and changes in the pandemic era. We discuss the meanings behind the themes and how r/AskOldPeople, as an age-integrated online community, supports intergenerational communication.  ",

      "abstract": "Do we live in a \"Golden Age of Conspiracy Theories?\" In the last few decades, conspiracy theories have proliferated on the Internet with some having dangerous real-world consequences. A large contingent of those who participated in the January 6th attack on the US Capitol fervently believed in the QAnon conspiracy theory. In this work, we study the relationships amongst five prominent conspiracy theories (QAnon, COVID, UFO/Aliens, 9/11, and Flat-Earth) and each of their respective relationships to the news media, both authentic news and misinformation. Identifying and publishing a set of 755 different conspiracy theory websites dedicated to our five conspiracy theories, we find that each set often hyperlinks to the same external domains, with COVID and QAnon conspiracy theory websites having the largest amount of shared connections. Examining the role of news media, we further find that not only do outlets known for spreading misinformation hyperlink to our set of conspiracy theory websites more often than authentic news websites but also that this hyperlinking increased dramatically between 2018 and 2021, with the advent of QAnon and the start of COVID-19 pandemic. Using partial Granger-causality, we uncover several positive correlative relationships between the hyperlinks from misinformation websites and the popularity of conspiracy theory websites, suggesting the prominent role that misinformation news outlets play in popularizing many conspiracy theories.",

In this work, we study human decision-making behavior and task performance under time pressure---induced from limited \\textit{initial observation time} (time to observe a task image before providing an initial response without AI input) and \\textit{final decision time} (time to weigh an AI's suggestion before reaching a collective human-AI team answer)---for spatial reasoning and count estimation tasks. Our results show that, while the impact of initial observation time on AI-assisted decision-making was dependent on task nature, participants were more likely to follow AI suggestions when they were provided with longer final decision time; moreover, although participants generally tended to adhere to their initial responses, they had more agency when they were more logically engaged in a task. Our results offer a nuanced understanding of human-AI collaboration under time pressure in different phases of the decision-making process.",

      "abstract": "Past work has explored various ways for online platforms to leverage crowd wisdom for misinformation detection and moderation. Yet, platforms often relegate governance to their communities, and limited research has been done from the perspective of these communities and their moderators. How is misinformation currently moderated in online communities that are heavily self-governed? What role does the crowd play in this process, and how can this process be improved? In this study, we answer these questions through semi-structured interviews with Reddit moderators. We focus on a case study of COVID-19 misinformation. First, our analysis identifies a general moderation workflow model which encompasses various processes adopted by participants for handling COVID-19 misinformation. Further, we show that the moderation workflow revolves around three elements: content facticity, user intent, and perceived harm. Next, our interviews also reveal that Reddit moderators rely on two types of crowd wisdom for misinformation detection. Almost all participants are heavily reliant on reports from crowds of ordinary users to identify potential misinformation. A second crowd--participants' own moderation teams and expert moderators of other communities--provide support when participants encounter difficult, ambiguous cases. Finally, we use design probes to better understand how different types of crowd signals---from ordinary users and moderators---readily available on Reddit can assist moderators with identifying misinformation. We observe that nearly half of all participants preferred these cues over labels from expert fact-checkers because these cues can help them discern user intent. Additionally, a quarter of the participants distrust professional fact-checkers, raising important concerns about misinformation moderation.",

To this end, we introduce the first publicly available dataset containing collaborative conversations on solving a well-established cognitive task, consisting of 500 group dialogues and 14k utterances. In 64% of these conversations, the group members are able to find a better solution than they had identified individually, and in 43.8% of the groups who had a correct answer as their final solution, none of the participants had solved the task correctly by themselves. Furthermore, we propose a novel annotation schema that captures deliberation cues and release all 14k utterances annotated with it.  Finally, we use the proposed dataset to develop and evaluate two methods for generating deliberation utterances. The data collection platform, dataset and annotated corpus will be made publicly available.",

      "abstract": "Prior work has identified a resilient phenomenon that threatens the performance of human-AI decision-making teams: overreliance, when people agree with an AI, even when it is incorrect. Surprisingly, overreliance does not reduce when the AI produces explanations for its predictions, compared to only providing predictions. Some have argued that overreliance results from cognitive biases or uncalibrated trust, attributing overreliance to an inevitability of human cognition. By contrast, our paper argues that people strategically choose whether or not to engage with an AI explanation, demonstrating empirically that there are scenarios where AI explanations reduce overreliance. To achieve this, we formalize this strategic choice in a cost-benefit framework, where the costs and benefits of engaging with the task are weighed against the costs and benefits of relying on the AI. We manipulate the costs and benefits in a maze task, where participants collaborate with a simulated AI to find the exit of a maze. Through 5 studies (𝑁 = 731), we find that costs such as task difficulty (Study 1), explanation difficulty (Study 2, 3), and benefits such as monetary compensation (Study 4) affect overreliance. Finally, Study 5 adapts the Cognitive Effort Discounting paradigm to quantify the utility of different explanations, providing further support for our framework. Our results suggest that some of the null effects found in literature could be due in part to the explanation not sufficiently reducing the costs of verifying the AI’s prediction.",

      "abstract": "In real-world applications when deploying Machine Learning (ML) models, initial model development includes close analysis of the model results and behavior by a data scientist. Once trained, however, models may need to be retrained with new data or updated to adhere to new rules or regulations. This presents two challenges. First, how to communicate how a model is making its decisions before and after retraining, and second how to support model editing to take into account new requirements. To address these needs, we built AIMEE (AI Model Explorer and Editor), a tool created to address these challenges by providing interactive methods to explain, visualize, and modify model decision boundaries using rules. Rules should benefit model builders by providing a layer of abstraction for understanding and manipulating the model and reduces the need to modify individual rows of data directly. To evaluate if this was the case, we conducted a pair of user studies totaling 23 participants to evaluate AIMEE's rules-based approach for model explainability and editing. We found that participants correctly interpreted rules and report on their perspectives of how rules are beneficial (and not), ways that rules could support collaboration, and provide a usability evaluation of the tool.",

      "abstract": "Numerous toolkits have been developed to support ethical AI development. However, toolkits, like all tools, encode assumptions in their design about what work should be done and how. In this paper, we conduct a qualitative analysis of 27 AI ethics toolkits to critically examine how the work of ethics is imagined and how it is supported by these toolkits. Specifically, we examine the discourses toolkits rely on when talking about ethical issues, who they imagine should do the work of ethics, and how they envision the work practices involved in addressing ethics. Among the toolkits, we identify a mismatch between the imagined work of ethics and the support the toolkits provide for doing that work. In particular, we identify a lack of guidance around how to navigate labor, organizational, and institutional power dynamics as they relate to performing ethical work. We use these omissions to chart future work for researchers and designers of AI ethics toolkits.",

      "abstract": "Online communities support the well-being of their members by encouraging their social identity formation. In the context of an online community, online activism in the form of identity struggles can be particularly helpful for marginalized individuals or groups. Since May 2020, students from the 985 universities, an elite educational project in China, have been coming to an online community named “The Inviting Plan for 985 Fives” on Douban, an interest-based Social Network Site (SNS), to discuss their failure and dissatisfaction in life. Students who were once recognized for their academic excellence now identify as “fives” (or “garbage”). The present study examines how the Douban group, as a social network and collaborative system, supports the group members in their identity struggles in the context of increasingly fierce peer competition in China. We employ a qualitative approach, combining ethnographic methods such as participant observation and semi-structured interviews, with in-depth analysis of the top discussion threads. We discover that while peer competition and social stratification in contemporary China cause students at the top universities to feel anxious and lost, the online community they built collectively supports them to create a new social identity, the identity of “five,” which is the basis of their online activism. Through this new identity, they seek unofficial democracy, civic participation, and possibilities of social change.",

      "abstract": "Social media sites like Reddit, Discord, and Clubhouse utilize a community-reliant approach to content moderation. Under this model, volunteer moderators are tasked with setting and enforcing content rules within the platforms' sub-communities. However, few mechanisms exist to ensure that the rules set by moderators reflect the values of their community. Misalignments between users and moderators can be detrimental to community health. Yet little quantitative work has been done to evaluate the prevalence or nature of user-moderator misalignment. Through a survey of 798 users on r/ChangeMyView, we evaluate user-moderator alignment at the level of policy-awareness (does users know what the rules are?), practice-awareness (do users know how the rules are applied?) and policy-/practice-support (do users agree with the rules and how they are applied?. We find that policy-support is high, while practice-support is low -- using a hierarchical Bayesian model we estimate the correlation between community opinion and moderator decisions to range from .14 to .45 across subreddit rules. Surprisingly, these correlations were only slightly higher when users were asked to predict moderator actions, demonstrating low awareness of moderation practices. Our findings demonstrate the need for careful analysis of user-moderator alignment at multiple levels. We argue that future work should focus on building tools to empower communities to conduct these analyses themselves.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Adolescent online safety researchers have emphasized the importance of moving beyond restrictive and privacy invasive approaches to online safety, towards resilience-based approaches for empowering teens to deal with online risks independently. Unfortunately, many of the existing online safety interventions are focused on parental mediation and not contextualized to teens’ personal experiences online; thus, they do not effectively cater to the unique needs of teens. To better understand how we might design online safety interventions that help teens deal with online risks, as well as when and how to intervene, we must include teens as partners in the design process and equip them with the skills needed to contribute equally to the design process. As such, we conducted User Experience (UX) bootcamps with 21 teens (ages 13-17) to first teach them important UX design skills using industry standard tools, so they could create storyboards for unsafe online interactions commonly experienced by teens and high-fidelity, interactive prototypes for dealing with these situations. Based on their storyboards, teens often encountered information breaches and sexual risks with strangers, as well as cyberbullying from acquaintances or friends. While teens often blocked or reported strangers, they struggled with responding to risks from friends or acquaintances, seeking advice from others on the best action to take. Importantly, teens did not find any of the existing ways for responding to these risks to be effective in keeping them safe. When asked to create their own design-based interventions, teens frequently envisioned “nudges” that occurred in real-time. Interestingly, teens more often designed for risk prevention (rather than risk coping) by focusing on nudging the risk perpetrator (rather than the victim) to rethink their actions, block harmful actions from occurring, or penalizing perpetrators for inappropriate behavior to prevent it from happening again in the future. Teens also designed personalized sensitivity filters to provide teens the ability to manage content they wanted to see online. Some teens also designed personalized nudges, so that teens could receive intelligent, guided advice from the platform that would help them know how to handle online risks themselves without intervention from their parents. Our findings highlight how teens want to address online risks “at the root” by putting the onus of risk prevention on those who perpetrate them – rather than on the victim. Our work is the first to leverage co-design with teens to develop novel online safety interventions that advocate for a paradigm shift from youth risk protection to promoting good digital citizenship.

      "abstract": "This paper combines design, machine learning and social computing to explore generative deep learning as both tool and probe for respiratory care. We first present GANspire, a deep learning tool that generates fine-grained breathing waveforms, which we crafted in collaboration with one respiratory physician, attending to joint materialities of human breathing data and deep generative models. We then relate a probe, produced with breathing waveforms generated with GANspire, and led with a group of ten respiratory care experts, responding to its material attributes. Qualitative annotations showed that respiratory care experts interpreted both realistic and ambiguous attributes of breathing waveforms generated with GANspire, according to subjective aspects of physiology, activity and emotion. Semi-structured interviews also revealed experts' broader perceptions, expectations and ethical concerns on AI technology, based on their clinical practice of respiratory care, and reflexive analysis of GANspire. These findings suggest design implications for technological aids in respiratory care, and show how ambiguity of deep generative models can be leveraged as a resource for qualitative inquiry, enabling socio-material research with generative deep learning. Our paper contributes to the CSCW community by broadening how generative deep learning may be approached not only as a tool to design human-computer interactions, but also as a probe to provoke open conversations with communities of practice about their current and speculative uses of AI technology.",

      "abstract": "AI systems are increasingly being used to support human decision making. It is important that AI advice is followed appropriately. However, according to existing literature, users typically under-rely or over-rely on AI systems, and this leads to sub-optimal team performance. In this context, we investigate the role of stated system accuracy by contrasting the lack of system information with the presence of system accuracy in a loan prediction task. We explore how the degree to which humans understand system accuracy influences their reliance on the AI system, by investigating numeracy levels and with the aid of analogies to explain system accuracy in a first of its kind between-subjects study (𝑁 = 281). We found that explaining the stated accuracy of a system using analogies failed to help users rely on the AI system appropriately (i.e., the tendency of users to rely on the system when the system is correct, or on themselves otherwise). To eliminate the impact of subjective attitudes towards analogy domains, we conducted a within-subjects study (𝑁 = 248) where each participant worked on tasks with analogy-based explanations from different domains. Results from this second study confirmed that explaining stated accuracy of the system with analogies was not sufficient to facilitate appropriate reliance on the AI system in the context of loan prediction tasks, irrespective of individual user differences. Based on our findings from the two studies, we reason that the under-reliance on the AI system may be a result of users’ overestimation of their own ability to solve the given task. Thus, although familiar analogies can be effective in improving the intelligibility of stated accuracy of the system, an improved understanding of system accuracy does not necessarily lead to improved system reliance and team performance.",

      "abstract": "Self-regulation of learning in programming has been extensively investigated, emphasising an individual's metacognitive and motivational regulation components. However, learning often happens in socially situated contexts, and little emphasis has been paid to studying social modes of regulation in programming. We designed Thyone, a collaborative Jupyter Notebook extension to support learners' programming regulation in an online classroom context with the overall aim to foster their intrinsic motivation toward programming. Thyone's salient features - Flowchart, Discuss and Share Cell - incorporate affordances for learners to co-regulate their learning and drive their motivation. In an exploratory quasi-experimental study, we investigated learners' engagement with Thyone's features and assessed its influence on their learning motivation in an introductory programming course. We found that Thyone facilitated the co-regulation of programming learning and that the users' engagement with Thyone appeared to positively influence components of their motivation: interest, autonomy, and relatedness. Our results inform the design of technological interventions to support co-regulation in programming learning.",

      "abstract": "Past and current research has shown that Knowledge and Expertise Sharing (KES) is central to the appropriation of enterprise software such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. ERP implementation projects in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are often driven by research and practice. However, they tend to focus on the ‘go live’ moment rather than on the subsequent, much longer post-implementation phase. This, we argue, results in decreased utilisation over time and an increased need for workarounds. In this paper, we draw on an empirical study within four organisations which exposes the limitations of KES in ERP implementation projects in SMEs, especially in regard to the preparation of key-users. Our findings suggest that, despite key-users' essential role in these projects, they are often chosen haphazardly and are ill-prepared. As a result, they cannot fulfil their role of facilitating KES with end-users, who end up appropriating ERP systems mostly through ‘learning by doing’. This stems directly from complex and largely unrecognised processes involving consultants, hotlines, management, key-users and end-users. In this paper, we introduce and discuss specific socio-technical, KES-oriented measures which can potentially lead to sustainable KES throughout the ERP life-cycle for longer-term success.",

      "abstract": "Computer-aided design (CAD) has become indispensable to increasingly-collaborative hardware design processes. Despite the long-standing and growing need for collaboration with CAD models and tools, anecdotal reports and ongoing researcher efforts point to a complex and unresolved set of challenges faced by designers when working with distributed CAD. We aim to close this academic-practitioner knowledge gap through the first systematic study of professional user-driven CAD collaboration challenges. In this work, we conduct semi-structured interviews with 20 CAD professionals of diverse industries, roles and experience levels to understand their collaborative workflows with distributed CAD tools. In total, we identify 14 challenges related to collaborative design, communication, data management, and permissioning that are currently impeding effective collaboration in professional CAD teams. Our systematic classification of CAD collaboration challenges presents a guide for pressing areas of future work, highlighting important implications for CAD researchers, practitioners and tool builders to target new advancement in CAD infrastructure, management choices and modelling best practices. With the insights gained from this work, we hope to ultimately improve collaboration efficiency, quality and innovation for future product design teams.",

      "abstract": "Social media offers an alternative source for entrepreneurs to expand their social networks and obtain relevant resources to support their ambitions. Aspiring entrepreneurs with limited access to resources and social networks might rely more on the opportunities that social media tools offer. However, aspiring entrepreneurs facing financial constraints who must navigate social media to realize their economic dreams often face challenges. Because aspiring entrepreneurs are transitioning to entrepreneurship, they must construct and even adapt to new work-role identities and new requisite skills, behaviors, attitudes, and patterns of interactions. In a re-analysis of a sub-sample of data from two empirical studies, this work examines how aspiring entrepreneurs living in a financially-constrained environment seek informational, social, and emotional support online and navigate their transition to entrepreneurship. These entrepreneurs obtained informational and emotional resources from observing other members' posts in online communities, including the next steps needed to adapt to their desired small business work roles. However, few publicly disclosed their informational or emotional needs online. We extend existing research on financially-constrained entrepreneurs' use of social media, contributing insights into how these resource-seeking practices limit their exploration of alternative entrepreneurial identities and feedback. We also contribute design implications to facilitate their online disclosure practices, including offering suggestions about ways to respond to questions and other disclosures in ways that restore trust and mitigate identity threats.

      "abstract": "Conspiracy theories in online spaces, such as anti-vaccination or QAnon, present a unique amalgamation of misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda disguised in entertaining, attention-grabbing content that may appeal to peoples' cultural, moral, or social identities. Studies aiming to understand how people may engage with conspiracy theory content online, or how they may lose belief in conspiracy theories often approach research from a purely theoretical or empirical point of view. In this work, through in-depth interviews with former believers of more than 12 conspiracy theories, \r\nwith experiences across almost two decades and numerous online platforms,\r\nwe aim to contribute an understanding of how various online and offline factors synergize to shape a user's engagement, tenure, and disengagement in online conspiracy theorizing. We further investigate how some users recover from conspiracy theorizing with the help of online recovery communities. We find how pre-existing biases and predispositions towards conspiracy theorizing often carry over in online spaces where a user's conspiracy theory worldviews further evolve through content recommendations, interactions in online communities, and socially-primed self-reflections. We also find reasons, such as exposure to inconsistencies in theories or toxicity and anti-social attitudes in online spaces, through which users get disillusioned from conspiracy theories. Our work has implications in bringing forward often unobserved impacts of internet-mediated conspiracy theorizing on the believers---the resulting mental health issues such as depression, distrust and anxiety, and social isolation---which is comparable to the indoctrination trauma. Moreover, our interviews reveal an important role played by online communities in helping users recover from conspiracy theory beliefs by finding empathy and solidarity in fellow former believers. We conclude by providing a path forward for how social computing researchers can contribute online community designs that aid existing issues surrounding safety, inclusivity, and lack of resources in existing online conspiracy theory recovery communities.

      "abstract": "Traditional wall-sized displays mostly only support side-by-side co-located collaboration, while transparent displays naturally support face-to-face interaction. Many previous works assume transparent displays support collaboration. Yet it is unknown how exactly its afforded face-to-face interaction can support loose or close collaboration, especially compared to the side-by-side configuration offered by traditional large displays. In this paper, we used an established experimental task that operationalizes different collaboration coupling and layout locality, to compare pairs of participants collaborating side-by-side versus face-to-face in each collaborative situation. We compared quantitative measures and collected interview and observation data to further illustrate and explain our observed user behavior patterns. The results showed that the unique face-to-face collaboration brought by transparent display can result in more efficient task performance, different territorial behavior, and both positive and negative collaborative factors. Our findings provided empirical understanding about the collaborative experience supported by wall-sized transparent displays and shed light on its future design.",

      "abstract": "Economically disadvantaged migrant workers are one of the most vulnerable groups in healthcare. Studies have shown that chatbots can help patients and health professionals in healthcare settings. However, the design of health chatbots for migrant workers has not been thoroughly investigated. Scenario-based interviews with nineteen participants, including ten economically disadvantaged Thai migrant workers and nine relevant stakeholders, were conducted to examine how they seek healthcare, obtain health information, and communicate with health professionals to gain a deeper understanding of the barriers that migrant workers encounter in healthcare. The findings of the interview show that migrant workers face a variety of barriers, such as a lack of familiarity with the healthcare system in the host country, language barriers, cultural barriers to seeking healthcare, and communication barriers with health professionals. Then, the technological design strategies and the benefits of health chatbots from the perspective of migrant workers were discussed, including their potential to help migrant workers navigate the healthcare system step-by-step, obtain reliable health information, improve their health literacy, and facilitate communication with health professionals. Finally, five design implications for chatbots were proposed to guide future development of health chatbots to help migrant workers. Policymakers and health professionals can benefit from the design implications of migrant worker-centered health chatbots when they develop health chatbots that promote the health and well-being of migrant workers.",

      "abstract": "Peer matching can enhance the impact of social health technologies. By matching similar peers, online health communities can optimally facilitate social modeling that supports positive health attitudes and moods. However, little work has examined how to operationalize similarities in digital health tools, thus limiting our ability to perform optimal peer matching. To address this gap, we conducted a factorial experiment to examine how three categories of similarity variables (i.e., Demographic, Ability, Experiential) can be used to perform peer matching that supports the social modeling of physical activity. We focus this study on physical activity because it is a health behavior that reduces the risk of chronic diseases. We also prioritized this study for single-caregiver mothers who often face substantial barriers to being active because of immense employment and household responsibilities, especially Black single-caregiver mothers. We recruited 309 single-caregiver mothers (49% Black, 51% white), then we asked them to listen to peer audio storytelling about family physical activity. We randomly matched/mismatched the storyteller's profile using the three categories of similarity variables. Our analyses demonstrated that matching by Demographic variables led to a significantly higher Physical Activity Intention. Furthermore, our subgroup analyses indicated that Black single-caregiver mothers experienced a significant and immediate effect of peer matching in Physical Activity Intention, Self-efficacy, and mood. In contrast, white single-caregiver mothers did not report any significant immediate effect. Collectively, our data suggest that peer matching in health storytelling is potentially beneficial for racially minoritized groups; and that having diverse representations in health technology is required for promoting health equity.",

While prior research shed light on the broad reasons behind the sharing of mobile phones, there is a dearth of systematic study to understand the user's decision-making process and the underlying preferences and concerns in the context of phone sharing. To address these gaps, we designed a prototype that we leveraged to investigate the interplay between a user's relationship with sharees, preferences of sharing a subset of apps with a certain entity, perceived sensitivity of the apps being shared, and how these factors relate to their authentication behavior. We conducted a multi-session study with 50 participants from three countries (USA, Turkey, and Nepal), where the participants interacted with our prototype and took part in semi-structured interviews. The findings from our study revealed the need for phone sharing at a granular level, where we identified the factors that could influence a user's decision-making process in sharing. Our analysis unpacked the relation between a user's perceived sensitivity of apps being shared, and authentication behavior to protect information from unauthorized access. Overall, our findings advance the CSCW community's understanding of how the user attains a balance between privacy protection and the need for phone sharing.",

      "abstract": "This paper examines craft’s foundational relations to materials, techniques, and collaborative modes of teaching and learning, and these can be called upon to strengthen and extend computational craft as practiced in fields like CSCW and HCI. Drawing from literature in HCI, craft studies and Science and Technology Studies (STS), we explore craft’s modern formation at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution across three formative sites: Scandinavian Slöyd, British Arts and Crafts, and Japanese Mingei. From this review we identify three key (and still evolving) features: craft’s accountabilities to natural materials and local ecologies; craft’s holistic ways of making with ‘head, heart, and hand’; and craft’s distinctly collaborative and embodied styles of teaching and learning. We then show how these lessons can be applied to contemporary practices and pedagogies of computational making. We argue that doing so can help to rebalance computation’s ecological ties and relations, recenter its practice on a sensorially rich and ‘whole-self’ concept of making, and support more collaborative modes of teaching and learning that are inclusive, relational, and heterogeneous.

      "abstract": "Recently, an increasing number of safety organizations in the U.S. have incorporated text-based risk reporting systems to respond to safety incident reports from their community members. To gain a better understanding of the interaction between community members and dispatchers using text-based risk reporting systems, this study conducts a system log analysis of LiveSafe, a community safety reporting system, to provide empirical evidence of the conversational patterns between users and dispatchers using both quantitative and qualitative methods. We created an ontology to capture information (e.g., location, attacker, target, weapon, start-time, and end-time, etc.) that dispatchers often collected from users regarding their incident tips. Applying the proposed ontology, we found that dispatchers often asked users for different information across varied event types (e.g., Attacker for Abuse and Attack events, Target for Harassment events). Additionally, using emotion detection and regression analysis, we found an inconsistency in dispatchers’ emotional support and responsiveness to users’ messages between different organizations and between incident categories. The results also showed that users had a higher response rate and responded quicker when dispatchers provided emotional support. These novel findings brought significant insights to both practitioners and system designers, e.g., AI-based solutions to augment human agents’ skills for improved service quality.",

      "abstract": "Older adults face unique risks in trying to secure their online activities. They are not only the frequent targets of scams and fraud; they are the targets of a barrage of cybersafety communiqués whose impact is unclear. AARP, the United States advocacy group focusing on issues facing older adults over the age of 50, is among those educators whose strategies remain underexplored, yet their reach makes it imperative that we understand what they are saying, to whom, and to what effect. Drawing on an analysis of AARP publications about cybersafety and privacy, we sought to better understand their discourse on the topic. We report on findings that AARP’s language may have the effect of portraying bad actors (“fraudsters”) as individuals, rather than enterprises, which at the target end, personalizes interactions, placing too much onus on individual users to assess and deflect threats. AARP’s positioning of, and guidance about, threats may sometimes prompt a thought process that puts users at the center of the narrative and may encourage engagement.  Instructing older Americans, or anyone, on the forensics of cyber-sleuthing is enormously difficult. We conclude with a discussion of different approaches to cybersafety, one that involves educating older adults about the rudiments of surveillance capitalism. ",

These students turn to social media for college-related social support. However, while students can reap benefits from social media, it is crucial to investigate under what conditions social media interactions facilitate or hinder students’ access to college-related social support. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 20 FGLI students in the United States who applied for college in the 2020-2021 application cycle. Our findings illustrate how FGLI identity disclosures on social media can facilitate access to college-related social support when met with supportive or neutral responses while stigmatizing reactions can disrupt access to these benefits. We draw from the lenses of the “doubly disadvantaged” and “privileged poor” used to describe FGLI students in post-secondary education to argue that engaging in FGLI identity disclosures on social media can help students become academically and psychosocially prepared for collegiate environments. Finally, we discuss the implications of this work for theoretical frameworks centering social media and social support, consider when stigma might lead to support space abandonment and describe the potential implications for social media design.",

Previous research argues that decisions can be modeled based on these users’ Goals, and the Affordances, Features, and Social Norms of those media. To evaluate this model, 19 participants were given different self-presentation scenarios and asked to choose between Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok. Participants also constructed a flowchart to represent their mental model of factors influencing their choices. Data suggest revisions to the model; rather than reflecting Affordances and Features, we found that Social Norms and Goals primarily drove participants' choices. Participants choose media based on a direct match between Goals and existing Social Norms. Only when they failed to detect such a match did participants consider Affordances and Features. We present a revised conceptual model based on these results and discuss social media design and theory implications.",

      "abstract": "When groups of people are tasked with making a judgment, the issue of uncertainty often arises. Existing methods to reduce uncertainty typically focus on iteratively improving specificity in the overall task instruction. However, uncertainty can arise from multiple sources, such as ambiguity of the item being judged due to limited context, or disagreements among the participants due to different perspectives and an under-specified task. A one-size-fits-all intervention may be ineffective if it is not targeted to the right source of uncertainty. In this paper we introduce a new workflow, Judgment Sieve, to reduce uncertainty in tasks involving group judgment in a targeted manner. By utilizing measurements that separate different sources of uncertainty during an initial round of judgment elicitation, we can then select a targeted intervention adding context or  deliberation to most effectively reduce uncertainty on each item being judged. We test our approach on two tasks: rating word pair similarity and toxicity of online comments, showing that targeted interventions reduced uncertainty for the most uncertain cases. In the top 10% of cases, we saw an ambiguity reduction of 21.4% and 25.7%, and a disagreement reduction of 22.2% and 11.2% for the two tasks respectively. We also found through a simulation that our targeted approach reduced the average uncertainty scores for both sources of uncertainty as opposed to uniform approaches where reductions in average uncertainty from one source came with an increase for the other.

One current clinical approach to addressing this issue is to use preventive medicine like pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). As medication adherence of PrEP is challenging that involves users’ individual knowledge, sex practices, relational status, and community support, technological mediation benefits from a human-centered perspective that goes beyond individual-level support to understand MSM’s needs so as to design a holistic technological intervention for them. With an in-depth interview (n = 22) with MSM from two major cities in Taiwan, we drew on the theoretical framework of the social ecological model and identified three levels of influences, including individual, interpersonal, and sociocultural, that shape the enablers, inhibitors, risks and challenges, and support towards MSM’s PrEP use. We proposed correspondent technological design implications to support what we found based on the understanding of our participants.",

      "abstract": "News media is often referred to as the Fourth Estate, a recognition of its political power. New understandings of how media shape political beliefs and influence collective behaviors are urgently needed in an era when public opinion polls do not necessarily reflect election results and users influence each other in real-time under algorithm-mediated content personalization. In this work, we measure not only the average but also the distribution of audience political leanings for different media across different countries. The methodological components of these new measurements include a high-fidelity COVID-19 tweet dataset; high-precision user geolocation extraction; and user political leaning estimated from the within-country retweet networks involving local politicians. We focus on geolocated users from eight countries, profile user leaning distribution for each country, and analyze bridging users who have interactions across multiple countries. Except for France and Turkey, we observe consistent bi-modal user leaning distributions in the other six countries, and find that cross-country retweeting behaviors do not oscillate across the partisan divide. More importantly, this study contributes a new set of media bias estimates by averaging the leaning scores of users who share the URLs from media domains. Through two validations, we find that the new average audience leaning scores strongly correlate with existing media bias scores. Lastly, we profile the COVID-19 news consumption by examining the audience leaning distribution for top media in each country, and for selected media across all countries. Those analyses help answer questions such as: Does center media Reuters have a more balanced audience base than partisan media CNN and Fox News in the US? Does far-right media Breitbart attract any left-leaning readers in any countries? Does CNN reach a more balanced audience base in the US than in UK and Spain? In sum, our data-driven methods allow us to study media that are not often collected in editor-curated media bias reporting, especially in non-English-speaking countries. We hope that such cross-country research would inform media outlets of their effectiveness and audience bases in different countries, inform non-government and research organizations about the country-specific media audience profiles, and inform individuals to reflect on our day-to-day media diet.",

      "abstract": "Families strengthen bonds by collectively constructing social identity through sharing stories, language, and culture. For immigrant families, language and culture barriers disrupt the mechanisms for maintaining intergenerational connection. Immigrant grandparents and grandchildren are particularly at risk of disconnect. In this paper, we investigate existing design guidelines using a tool (StoryTapestry) to explore the storytelling and crafting process of South-Asian immigrant grandparents and grandchildren. In this exploration, pairs used culturally-relevant images to create digital visual artifacts that tell their stories. Grandparent-grandchild pairs from 10 South-Asian immigrant families participated in this exploration of how the digital process fosters positive social connection, culture sharing, and co-construction. A thematic analysis revealed how collaborative digital crafting encourages the crossing of language and culture barriers, knowledge sharing, and creativity. We contribute an understanding of interaction dynamics and socio-technical implications of intergenerational and cross-cultural collaboration by demonstrating (1) that collaborative digital crafting can reverse traditional educator and learner roles to create culture sharing opportunities, (2) that grandparents play a central role in maintaining social interaction, (3) that structure can guide grandparent-grandchild pairs to a shared goal, and (4) that flexibility encourages engagement from children. We synthesize ideas from migration and collaboration research, and we discuss how the culture, language, and generational dynamics in our study extend what is known about each of these spaces. Together, our design implications offer insight into building digital tools that promote engagement, knowledge sharing, and collaboration between immigrant grandparents and grandchildren navigating social disconnect post-migration.

      "abstract": "The management of error has become an increasingly central and contested question in data science work. While much recent scholarship in artificial intelligence and machine learning has focused on limiting and eliminating error, practitioners have also long used error as a site of collaboration and learning vis-à-vis labelers, domain experts and the specific worlds data scientists seek to model and understand. Drawing on work in CSCW, STS, HCML and repair studies, as well as multisited ethnographic fieldwork in a government institution and a non-profit organization, we move beyond the notion of error as edge case or anomaly to make three basic arguments: first, that error discloses or calls to attention existing structures of collaboration unseen or underappreciated under ‘working’ systems; second, that error calls into being new forms and sites of collaboration (including, sometimes, new actors); and third, that error redeploys old sites and actors in new ways, including by restructuring relations of hierarchy and expertise that may alternately recenter and/or devalue the position of different actors. We conclude by discussing how an artful living with error can better support creative strategies of negotiation and adjustment that data scientists and their collaborators engage in when faced with disruption, breakdown, and frictions in AI.

The communities responsible for building this cyberinfrastructure require maintenance and moderation, which is often supported by volunteer efforts. Moderation, as a non-technical form of labor, is a necessary but often overlooked task that maintainers undertake to sustain the community around an OSS project. This study examines the various structures and norms that support community moderation, describes the strategies moderators use to mitigate conflicts, and assesses how bots can play a role in assisting these processes. We interviewed 14 practitioners to uncover existing moderation practices and ways that automation can provide assistance. Our main contributions include a characterization of moderated content in OSS projects, moderation techniques, as well as perceptions of and recommendations for improving the automation of moderation tasks. We hope that these findings will inform the implementation of more effective moderation practices in open source communities.",

A subset of people who were infected with the virus have ongoing chronic health issues that range in type of symptom and severity. In this study, we conducted a qualitative assessment of self-reported post-COVID symptoms from patients’ electronic health records (EHR, n=564) and a randomized collection of Reddit and Twitter posts (n=500 for each). We show the inconsistencies in what types of symptoms are shared between platforms in addition to assessing the severity of the symptoms and how social media characterizations of post-COVID do not tell a complete story of this phenomenon. This research contributes to CSCW health literature by connecting digital traces of post-COVID with EHR data, critiquing the use of social media as a health proxy and points to its potential to add context to the analysis of traditional health data extracted from the EHR.",

      "abstract": "Following Facebook's introduction of the \"Like\" in 2009, CaringBridge (a nonprofit health journaling platform) implemented a \"Heart\" symbol as a single-click reaction affordance in 2012. In 2016, Facebook expanded its Like into a set of emotion-based reactions. In 2021, CaringBridge likewise added three new reactions: \"Prayer\", \"Happy\", and \"Sad.\" Through user surveys (N=808) and interviews (N=13), we evaluated this product launch. Unlike Likes on mainstream social media, CaringBridge's single-click Heart was consistently interpreted as a simple, meaningful expression of acknowledgement and support. Although most users accepted the new reactions, the product launch transformed user perceptions of the feature and ignited major disagreement regarding the meanings and functions of reactions in the high stakes context of health crises. Some users found the new reactions to be useful, convenient, and reducing of caregiver burden; others felt they cause emotional harms by stripping communication of meaningful expression and authentic care. Overall, these results surface tensions for small social media platforms that need to survive amidst giants, as well as highlighting crucial trade-offs between the cognitive effort, meaningfulness, and efficiency of different forms of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC). Our work provides three contributions to support researchers and designers in navigating these tensions: (1) empirical knowledge of how users perceived the reactions launch on CaringBridge; (2) design implications for improving health-focused CMC; and (3) concrete questions to guide future research into reactions and health-focused CMC.",

      "abstract": "Algorithmic risk assessments are being deployed in an increasingly broad spectrum of domains including banking, medicine, and law enforcement. However, there is widespread concern about their fairness and trustworthiness, and people are also known to display algorithm aversion, preferring human assessments even when they are objectively worse. Thus, how does the framing of who made an assessment affect how people perceive it? We investigate whether individual algorithmic assessments are perceived to be more or less accurate, fair, and interpretable than identical human assessments, and explore how these perceptions change when assessments are obviously biased against a subgroup. To this end, we conducted an online experiment that manipulated how biased risk assessments are in a loan repayment task, and reported the assessments as being made either by a statistical model or a human analyst. We find that predictions made by the model are consistently perceived as less fair and less interpretable than those made by the analyst. Furthermore, biased predictive errors were more likely to widen this perception gap, with the algorithm being judged even more harshly for making a biased mistake. Our results illustrate that who makes risk assessments can influence perceptions of how acceptable those assessments are – even if they are identically accurate and identically biased against subgroups. Additional work is needed to determine whether and how decision aids should be presented to stakeholders so that the inherent fairness and interpretability of their recommendations, rather than their framing, determines how they are perceived.",

In collaborative systems understanding differing values could help design solutions to mitigate conflicts and more effectively coordinate collaboration.

We use this synthetic framework to analyze a dataset of 32 interviews with contributors to Wikimedia Commons and editors of Wikipedia who use Commons resources. Our analysis supports the prior values categories while expanding how some dimensions are expressed by participants. We also highlight four additional value dimensions that were not previously identified in CBPP: cultural heritage value, rarity value, aesthetic value, and administrative value.

      "abstract": "COVID-19 has created a dramatic paradigm shift in education methods, which forced schools and universities to abandon the usual in-person education in favor of online education modules. Such a shift has extended the time and use of internet communication technologies (ICTs) by most, making online education platforms primary cyberattack targets. In this context, this study aims to explore parents, educators, and other caregivers concerns about online education and the cybersecurity of their children and students. Thus, we conducted a survey-based study with 983 participants recruited through popular crowdsourcing platforms: MTurk and Prolific. Our results indicate a lack of technical support following digital safety that the students received with the sudden transition to online education. Over 31% of our participants claimed that they never or rarely receive any communication related to cyber safety from the students' educational institutions. Additionally, our analysis shows that the student support structure needs to be trained and informed on the threats faced by children online and on the ways to mitigate these threats. Finally, we find a statistically significant difference between parents, educators, and other caregivers regarding their perceptions of children's online privacy and cyber safety. We conclude this work by providing actionable recommendations to promote privacy-preserving and digitally secure online education.",

However, international students’ mental well-being remains underexplored in HCI. In this study, we conducted remote synchronous remote co-design sessions with 19 participants (14 international students, 5 mental health professionals) to understand concretely what types of designs for interactive technologies suit these students’ mental health needs and challenges. Based on their brainstormed ideas and sketches, we produced a set of design dimensions which span different types of support, interaction, and safety. The dimensions were then used to develop a set of four medium-fidelity mockups that spanned these dimensions, presenting a diverse range of design features. Using these mockups, we elicited feedback in an online survey from the same participants. Findings suggest that the students negotiate a complex understanding of helpfulness, comfort, and trust when they consider what types of designs to consider using. Each mockup highlights different ways to support individual differences and preferences. Our work serves as a foundation for designing technologies that can ease issues with accessibility and be more inclusive of international students' cultural backgrounds.",

Prior studies have reported volunteer moderators' diverse roles in different governance models, highlighting the tensions between moderators and other stakeholders (e.g., administrative teams and users). Building upon prior research, this paper focuses on how volunteer moderators moderate racist content and how a platform's governance influences these practices. To understand how moderators deal with racist content, we conducted in-depth interviews with 13 moderators from city subreddits on Reddit. We found that moderators heavily relied on AutoMod to regulate racist content and racist user accounts. However, content that was crafted through covert racism and ``color-blind'' racial frames was not addressed well. We attributed these challenges in moderating racist content to (1) moderators' concerns of power corruption, (2) arbitrary moderator team structures, and (3) evolving forms of covert racism. Our results demonstrate that decentralized governance on Reddit could not support local efforts to regulate color-blind racism. Finally, we discuss the conceptual and practical ways to disrupt color-blind moderation.",

      "abstract": "Instructors using algorithmic team formation tools must decide which criteria (e.g., skills, demographics, etc.) to use to group students into teams based on their teamwork goals, and have many possible sources from which to draw these configurations (e.g., the literature, other faculty, their students, etc.). However, tools offer considerable flexibility and selecting ineffective configurations can lead to teams that do not collaborate successfully. Due to such tools' relative novelty, there is currently little knowledge of how instructors choose which of these sources to utilize, how they relate different criteria to their goals for the planned teamwork, or how they determine if their configuration or the generated teams are successful. To close this gap, we conducted a survey (N=77) and interview (N=21) study of instructors using CATME Team-Maker and other criteria-based processes to investigate instructors' goals and decisions when using team formation tools. The results showed that instructors prioritized students learning to work with diverse teammates and performed \"sanity checks\" on their formation approach's output to ensure that the generated teams would support this goal, especially focusing on criteria like gender and race. However, they sometimes struggled to relate their educational goals to specific settings in the tool. In general, they also did not solicit any input from students when configuring the tool, despite acknowledging that this information might be useful. By opening the \"black box\" of the algorithm to students, more learner-centered approaches to forming teams could therefore be a promising way to provide more support to instructors configuring algorithmic tools while at the same time supporting student agency and learning about teamwork.",

Through interviews with people who have joined or considered joining social media-based support groups following pregnancy loss (N=18), we provide an intracommunity view into social comparison within online support groups. We identify a set of identity and experience attributes that inform perceptions of similarity and difference in these support spaces. We characterize tensions arising from these attributes and propose the preliminary Social Comparison and Social Support in Online Support Groups model to describe interactions between social support and comparison processes within online support groups. We further discuss findings’ implications for design, including via introducing the tolerance principle of online health support groups. CAUTION: This paper includes quotes about pregnancy loss.",

      "abstract": "Especially in developing regions, parents are rarely given a direct voice in the design of digital maternal and child health (MCH) interventions. Instead, MCH needs and requirements are driven by organizations and health workers. In this research, we engage with both rural and urban parents and community leaders to better understand their challenges and priorities for digital MCH and propose a parent-centered agenda for human-computer interaction research. This paper reports on the community-based, digital MCH priorities identified in our research and describes how we approached community discourse and co-design of digital initiatives for these priorities, through parent-centered workshops with low-resource South African communities. Furthermore, we provide the parent-centred design opportunities and tensions we discovered for digital MCH in South African contexts, such as designing for local contexts and languages, designing for accessibility and connectedness, and highlighting the underdeveloped digital MCH niches to design for. Finally, we highlight the importance of facilitators for co-design workshops, such as using intermediaries and design cards.",

      "abstract": "Continuous blood glucose monitoring (CGM) is a bio-sensing technology designed to help individuals with diabetes understand and manage their blood sugar levels. Better control and management have the promise of extending and improving the quality of life with diabetes. For teenagers with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), CGM has the potential to allow for a more collaborative T1D management and control experience by sharing real-time blood glucose data with caregivers. To understand how well CGM designs are living up to this promise and to identify potential challenges, we used the Asynchronous Remote Communities (ARC) with 16 teenagers with T1D and their informal caregivers over a 6 month period to investigate families’ lived experiences with CGM and its data sharing function. We found three challenges in caregiver-teenager collaboration; lack of visibility into behaviors behind data, difficulties balancing teenage daily life with T1D control, and technical limitations of current CGM systems. We also found three issues that hinder informal caregiving coordination; unclear task assignment, difficulties in maintaining standards of care, and a lack of informal caregiver rotation. We provide a number of design implications based on these findings to better facilitate home care for teenagers’ T1D.",

There are several strategies that can be applied to protect IDP, but little is known regarding how social media users perceive IDP threats or how they prefer to respond to them. We utilized a mixed-method approach with a replication study to examine user beliefs about various government-, platform-, and user-level strategies for managing IDP violations. Participants reported that IDP represented a ‘serious’ online threat, and identified themselves as primarily responsible for responding to violations. IDP strategies that felt more familiar and provided greater perceived control over violations (e.g., flagging, blocking, unfriending) were rated as more effective than platform or government driven interventions. Furthermore, we found users were more willing to share on social media if they perceived their interactions as protected. Findings are discussed in relation to control paradox theory.",

However, public and social sector organizations often have goals that are difficult to measure. To better understand how data can be more sensitively appropriated in difficult-to-measure contexts, we conducted design workshops with 25 individuals with a stake in how homelessness is measured–including funders, staff and people experiencing homelessness. This study provides a detailed account of how diverse stakeholders measure progress towards these often difficult and vague goals. We found that the approaches to data collection fall under either the sociocentric perspective (which seeks to answer questions about community-level impact) or the egocentric perspective (which focuses more on the experience of the individual experiencing homelessness). We argue that in contexts where goals are vague and difficult to observe or measure, collaborative information systems should be approached by combining the sociocentric and egocentric perspectives into an oligopticon, rather than focusing only on the sociocentric perspective (which can be understood as a panopticon). As we outline, oligopticonic information systems have the capacity to deal with more diverse types of data and experiences by embracing the requirements that we have outlined.",

      "abstract": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, video conferencing platforms have given rise to new virtual activities, such as virtual study rooms where users utilize video to share ambient presence for study motivation. In virtual study rooms, it can be challenging for the users to determine what to reveal and what to hide on camera, as the video needs to strongly convey their presence without revealing more than necessary. In this paper, we investigate the conflicting needs of virtual study room users to reveal and hide on camera, as well as the methods they employ to cope with these needs using videos. To this end, we conducted a three-step qualitative study. The first study involved interviews to discover the key user needs that entail the conflict to reveal and hide. The second study utilized virtual study room screen analysis to identify the video features that characterize virtual study room videos. In the last study, we employed interviews to associate the video features with the key user needs. Based on these findings, we discussed the effects of studying together that could be applied to a non-physical and non-interactive co-studying environment and the need for further development of video conferencing tools to effectively share ambient presence.",

      "abstract": "Transition planning is a collaborative process to promote agency in students with disabilities by encouraging them to participate in setting their own goals with team members and learn ways to assess their progress towards the goals. For autistic young adults who experience a lower employment rate, less stability in employment, and lower community connections than those with other disabilities, successful transition planning is an important opportunity to develop agency towards preparing and attaining success in employment and other areas meaningful to them. However, a failure of consistent information sharing among team members and opportunities for agency in students has prevented successful transition planning for autistic students. Therefore, this work brings causal agency theory and the collaborative reflection framework together to uncover ways transition teams can develop students' agency by collaboratively reflecting on students' inputs related to transition goals and progress. By interviewing autistic students, parents of autistic students, and professionals who were involved in transition planning, we uncovered that teams can better support student agency by accommodating their needs and encouraging their input in annual meetings, building relationships through transparent and frequent communication about day-to-day activities, centering goals on student's interests, and supporting student's skill-building in areas related to their transition goals. However, we found that many teams were not enacting these practices, leading to frustration and negative outcomes for young adults. Based on our findings, we propose a role for autistic students in the collaborative reflection framework that encouraged participation and builds causal agency. We also make design recommendations to encourage autistic students' participation in collaborative reflection around long-term and short-term needs in ways that promote their causal agency.",

Trust is especially vital among migrants who move to new countries and need time to develop trust after arrival. To understand migrants' trust development in community commerce and its potential and challenges for supporting their transition to the U.S., we conducted 24 semi-structured interviews with migrants who had lived there for three years or less. We highlight practices embedded in difficulties engaging with technologies in a new place. We identify four forms of migrants' trust and show how their offline experiences with local communities reflect their online trust development in community commerce and vice versa, thereby creating unique challenges in their adaptation to new technologies. We coin the term sociotechnical adaptation to frame migrants' distinctive adjustments to social media technologies in a new country. We conclude with implications for creating community commerce platforms that foster migrants' trust and a reflection on how sociotechnical adaptation may vary among diverse migrant populations.",

      "abstract": "This paper considers food delivery work as a form of piecework that is conducted via a particular workflow system -- the food delivery platform and its delivery app. We offer an ethnographic account of food delivery labor during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Indian city of Pune. Our inquiry is focused on (1) the \\emph{workflow} that structures food delivery work and (2) how \\emph{economic considerations} shape how workers work with and around the workflow. Our findings depict both the workflow that structures the delivery work and the efforts workers make beyond it to deal with contingencies and unexpected requirements they \\colorbox{yellow}{ encounter }on the ground. We recognize the workers' efforts as essential to make the workflow work but also to make the piecework arrangement work for them. We highlight how, in this setting, money is not just the motivation for engaging in gig work; rather, economic considerations infuse every aspect of the work process. Acknowledging the distinct shape gig work takes in a Global South context, our study highlights the value of in-depth, \\textit{in situ} understandings of how gig workers' economic considerations are entangled with their interactions with the technology that structures their work. Our key contribution lies in mapping out \\textit{the workflow of piecework} and \\textit{the work to make piecework work}, specifically in a Global South setting, by drawing upon classic CSCW themes around workflows and piecework to strengthen the contemporary scholarly discussion concerning gig work.",

Our article sheds light on the techno-religious practices and information strategies used to mitigate isolation, share information, and celebrate Ramadan. We examine the sociotechnical configurations of religious rituals and highlight the resilience of these rituals even in the midst of a global pandemic. Our paper contributes to CSCW scholarship on technology appropriation and non-use as they relate to religious practices in the face of exogenous shocks such as the pandemic, and how design can better cater to the religious lives of individuals and communities.",

      "abstract": "Online harassment against women - particularly in gaming and virtual worlds contexts - remains a salient and pervasive issue, and arguably reflects the systems of offline structural oppression to control women's bodies and rights in today's world. Harassment in social Virtual Reality (VR) is also a growing new frontier of research in HCI and CSCW, particularly focusing on marginalized users such as women. Based on interviews with 31 women users of social VR, our findings present women's experiences of harassment risks in social VR as compared to harassment targeting women in pre-existing, on-screen online gaming and virtual worlds, along with strategies women employ to manage harassment in social VR with varying degrees of success. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on harassment in social VR by highlighting how women's marginalization online and offline impact their perceptions of and strategies to mitigate harassment in this unique space. It also provides a critical reflection on women's mitigation strategies and proposes important implications to rethink social VR design to better prevent harassment against women and other marginalized communities in the future metaverse.

      "abstract": "Issue Tracking Systems (ITS) often support commenting on software issues, which create a space for discussions centered around bug fixes and improvements to the software. For Open Source Software (OSS) projects, issue discussions serve as a crucial collaboration mechanism for diverse stakeholders. However, issue discussions can become lengthy, making it hard to find relevant information and make further contributions. In this work, we study the use of summarization to aid users in collaboratively making sense of OSS issue discussion threads. Through an empirical investigation, we reveal a complex picture of how summarization is used by issue users as a strategy to help develop and manage their discussions. Grounded on the different objectives served by the summaries and the outcome of our formative study with OSS stakeholders, we identified a set of guidelines to inform the design of collaborative summarization tools for OSS issue discussions. We then developed SUMMIT, a tool that allows issue users to collectively construct summaries of different types of information discussed, as well as those outlining a set of comments within the thread. To alleviate the manual effort involved, SUMMIT uses techniques that automatically detect information types and summarize texts to facilitate the generation of these summaries. A lab user study indicates that, as the users of SUMMIT, OSS stakeholders adopted different strategies to acquire information on issue threads. Furthermore, different features of SUMMIT effectively lowered the perceived difficulty of locating information from issue threads and enabled the users to prioritize their effort. Overall, our findings demonstrated the potential of SUMMIT, and the corresponding design guidelines, in supporting users to acquire information from lengthy discussions in ITSs. Our work sheds light on the key considerations when exploring crowd-based and machine-learning-enabled instruments for asynchronous collaboration on complex tasks such as OSS development.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Many digital wellbeing tools help users monitor and control social media use on their smartphones by tracking and setting limits on their usage time. Tracking is typically done at the granularity of phone- or app-level; however, recent social media apps provide various \\emph{features} such as direct messaging, comment reading/posting, and content uploading/viewing. While it is possible to track and analyze the \\emph{within-app} feature usage, little is known about the effect of granularity on smartphone interventions. We designed and developed \\emph{FinerMe} to explore how the granularity of interventions (app-level vs. feature-level) affects the usage of popular social media such as Instagram and YouTube on smartphones. We conducted a field study with 56 participants over 16 days that consisted of three phases: baseline collection, self-reflection, and self-reflection with restrictive interventions. The results showed that while both app-level and feature-level interventions similarly reduced social media use, feature-level interventions enabled users to spend less time on passive app features related to content consumption (e.g., following feed on Instagram, viewing comments on YouTube) than app-level interventions. Moreover, when self-reflection is combined with restrictive interventions at the feature-level, users were more reflective on their usage behavior than when done at the app-level. ",

      "abstract": "Educational technologies can provide students with adaptive feedback and guidance, but these systems lack personal interactions that make social and cultural connections to the student's own classroom and prior experiences. Social or companion robots have a high capacity for these types of interactions, but typically require advanced levels of expertise to program. In this study, we examined teachers use of an authoring tool to enable them to leverage their classroom-based expertise to design robot-assisted homework assignments, and explore how seeing a robot enact their designs influences their work. We found that the tool enabled the teachers to create novel social interactions for homework activities that were similar to their classroom interaction patterns. These interaction designs evolved over time and were shaped by the teacher's emerging mental model of the social robot, their concept of the students' perspective of these interactions, and a shift towards informal classroom-like interaction paradigms, thus transforming their view of what they can achieve with homework. We discuss how these findings demonstrate how the context of the activity can influence initial mental models of social activities and suggest practical guidance on designing authoring tools to best facilitate the creation of computer or robot supported social activities, such as homework.",

      "abstract": "Mobile and web apps are increasingly relying on the data generated or provided by users such as from their uploaded documents and images. Unfortunately, those apps may raise significant user privacy concerns. Specifically, to train or adapt their models for accurately processing huge amounts of data continuously collected from millions of app users, app or service providers have widely adopted the approach of crowdsourcing for recruiting crowd workers to manually annotate or transcribe the sampled ever-changing user data. However, when users' data are uploaded through apps and then become widely accessible to hundreds of thousands of anonymous crowd workers, many human-in-the-loop related privacy questions arise concerning both the app user community and the crowd worker community. In this paper, we propose to investigate the privacy risks brought by this significant trend of large-scale crowd-powered processing of app users' data generated in their daily activities. We consider the representative case of receipt scanning apps that have millions of users, and focus on the corresponding receipt transcription tasks that appear popularly on crowdsourcing platforms. We design and conduct an app user survey study (n=108) to explore how app users perceive privacy in the context of using receipt scanning apps. We also design and conduct a crowd worker survey study (n=102) to explore crowd workers' experiences on receipt and other types of transcription tasks as well as their attitudes towards such tasks. Overall, we found that most app users and crowd workers expressed strong concerns about the potential privacy risks to receipt owners, and they also had a very high level of agreement with the need for protecting receipt owners' privacy. Our work provides insights on app users' potential privacy risks in crowdsourcing, and highlights the need and challenges for protecting third party users' privacy on crowdsourcing platforms. We have responsibly disclosed our findings to the related crowdsourcing platform and app providers.",

However, these platforms sometimes employ manipulative tactics that undermine a user's sense of agency over time and content choice to increase their share of a user's attention. Prior research has investigated how interface designs affect a user’s sense of agency on social media and YouTube. For example, YouTube's autoplay left users feeling like they had less control over their time. We extend this work by investigating the design elements of Netflix, the most used SVOD, for the impact they have on users' senses of agency. We conducted interviews with 20 participants that used Netflix regularly, asking about their experiences and perceptions of features in the Netflix platform design that may affect their sense of agency. We found that a user's sense of agency was at odds with the platform’s design. Users, who were often seeking entertainment for mood management, were met with features that encouraged watching more than they originally planned to and watching content they may not otherwise watch. We discuss design recommendations that Netflix could employ to reaffirm their users' agency.",

      "abstract": "We present an exploration of cultural norms surrounding online disclosure of information about one's interpersonal relationships (such as information about family members, colleagues, friends, or lovers). Our study extends the prior literature on Multi-Party Privacy and information disclosure by probing on cultural differences.\r\nIn order to identify tweets about one's interpersonal relationships, we performed a two step process. First, we utilized a card-sort study to develop a culturally-sensitive saturated taxonomy of words that represent interpersonal relationships (e.g., ma, mom, mother). Then we developed a high-accuracy interpersonal disclosure detector based on dependency-parsing (F1-score: 86\\%) to identify when the words refer to a personal relationship of the poster (e.g., \"my mom\" as opposed to \"a mom\"). This allowed us to filter through more than 2 million tweets posted in the U.S. and India over a 3 month period. We thus identified 400K+ tweets that disclosed information about the poster's interpersonal relationships. Prior literature identifies the cultural dimension of individualism versus collectivism as being a major determinant of offline communication differences in terms of emotion, topic, and content disclosed. Thus, we took a mixed methods approach to analyze these differences between tweets from an individualist (U.S.) versus collectivist (India) society (e.g., comparing the amount of joy expressed about one's family).\r\nWe identify several cultural differences in disclosure behaviors. We also reveal how a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods are needed to uncover these differences; Using just one or the other can be misleading. The paper concludes by providing recommendations on how future systems designers can study and design for culturally-sensitive interpersonal disclosure norms.\r\n",

      "abstract": "With the rapid shift to remote learning in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, parents, teachers, and students  had to quickly adapt to what scholars have called emergency remote learning (ERL). This transition required increased reliance on digital tools, exacerbating privacy and security threats associated with expanded data collection and new vulnerabilities. In this study, we adopt a sociotechnical and infrastructural perspective to understand how these threats emerged through breakdowns and tensions in elementary school ERL. Through interviews with 29 US-based teachers and parents of elementary school students (grades PreK-6), we identify two core findings related to privacy and security. First, we detail three breakdowns in the ERL sociotechnical infrastructure: (1) reduced attention to privacy and security issues as parents and teachers cobbled together a patchwork of tools needed to make ERL work; (2) privacy and security risks that emerged from ambiguous and shifting school policies; and (3) the failure to adapt standard authentication mechanisms (e.g., passwords) to be usable by young children. Second, we identify tensions between parents' and teachers' desire to help children advance in their education and their desire for children's privacy and security in ERL, as well as tensions resulting from the collapse of home and school contexts. These findings collectively suggest that ERL exacerbated existing--and created new--privacy and security challenges for young students, and we argue these challenges will carry beyond the pandemic due to the increasing use of technology to supplement traditional education. In light of these findings, we recommend researchers and educators use a framework of care to develop social and technical approaches to improving remote learning in order to protect children's privacy and security.",

      "abstract": "Data are wielded to shape public opinion, particularly in electoral contexts where the role and veracity of information is questioned. This post-truth era is characterized by world events in which facts too often are obfuscated and evidential standards are abandoned. To study how data are used to influence pressing and divisive contemporary issues, this paper explores the rhetorical work that quantitative data are doing through the blogging practices of advocacy organizations during the highly-polarized month preceding the 2016 United States elections. We present results of a qualitative content analysis of the quantitative data used in 337 blog posts published by five pairs of conservative and liberal advocacy organizations over the course of the month leading up to the 2016 US elections. We identify key data rhetoric practices along partisan lines and contribute an analytic framework–evaluating ethos, pathos, and logos— that can be used to analyze the rhetorical use of data in other contexts. We then characterize two different imaginaries that come into conflict in this research: 1) the political imaginaries being promoted through organizational blogging and 2) the sociotechnical imaginary of the data economy, foregrounding differences in the epistemic value of data in each. We conclude by outlining research challenges and trajectories for future research within each of the two imaginaries of data.",

In this paper, we identify the sociotechnical futures that Amazon—one of the big tech companies—envisions and the future of work that the company is moving toward. We explore the future of fulfillment centers through an analysis of the patents on fulfillment center technologies which Amazon may turn into reality one day. In our analysis, we focus on humans by asking how they are configured in the future of fulfillment centers and, more specifically, how Amazon envisions the role of human labor within work automation and AI systems. Our analysis reveals where and how humans are expected to “step in” to operate the future of fulfillment centers. We discuss our findings within and beyond CSCW, highlighting the importance of studying tech companies’ imaginaries. We argue that by understanding tech companies’ imaginaries, it becomes possible for us to launch effective sociotechnical interventions to negotiate or even resist their specific imaginaries and/or design ways for a more democratic uptake of companies’ future technologies. Finally, we articulate practical ways in which patents can be utilized in CSCW research. ",

      "abstract": "Social programs run by community organizations provide an important outlet for social connectedness among older adults. However, these programs were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. In this study, we aimed to understand how community organizations used digital technologies to continue running social programs online for older adults during COVID-19. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 staff members from local councils, libraries, community groups and care providers. We found that the use of technology benefited organizations by revealing new program delivery opportunities, and by strengthening their social bonds with older adults. However, organizations experienced challenges when transitioning social programs online. Some organizations lacked financial and human resources to support online programs; staff needed to upskill themselves and put significant effort into transferring older adults online; and it was difficult to replicate in-person experiences in online settings. Staff developed ad-hoc strategies to help older adults participate by providing extra guidance and training to increase digital literacy, and by offering accessible technical support. We discuss the significance of continuing online social programs beyond the pandemic, the importance of scaffolding to enable the online participation of older adults in social programs, and we outline design considerations for technology-mediated social programs run by community organizations.",

      "abstract": "In the system and network administration domain, gender diversity remains a distant target. The experiences and perspectives of sysadmins who belong to marginalized genders (non cis men) are not well understood beyond the fact that sysadmin work environments are generally not equitable. We address this knowledge gap in our study by focusing on the ways in which sysadmins from marginalized genders manage their work in men-dominated sysadmin work spaces and by understanding what an inclusive workplace would look like. Using a feminist research approach, we engaged with a group of 16 sysadmins who are not cis men via six online focus groups. We found that managing the impact of gender identity in the sysadmin workplace means demonstrating excellence and going above and beyond in system administration tasks, and also requires performing additional care work not expected from cis men. Furthermore, our participants handle additional layers of work due to gender considerations and to actively find community in the workplace. To mitigate this additional workload, we recommend more care for care work. For future research, we recommend the use of feminist lenses when studying sysadmin work in order to provide more equitable solutions that ultimately contribute to improving system security by fostering a just workplace.",

      "abstract": "Learners' awareness of their own affective states (affects) can improve their meta-cognition, which is a critical skill of being  aware of and controlling one's cognitive, motivational, and affect, and adjusting their learning strategies and behaviors accordingly. To investigate the effect of AI-generated peers' affects on learners' meta-cognition, we proposed two types of cues that aggregated peers' affects that were recognized via facial expression recognition: \\textit{Locative} cues (displaying the spikes of peers' emotions along a video timeline) and \\textit{Temporal} cues (showing the positivities of peers' emotions at different segments of a video). We conducted a between-subject experiment with 42 college students through the use of think-aloud protocols, interviews, and surveys. Our results showed that the two types of cues improved participants' meta-cognition differently. For example, interacting with the \\textit{Temporal} cues triggered the participants to compare their own affective responses with their peers and reflect more on why and how they had different emotions with the same video content. While the participants perceived the benefits of using AI-generated peers’ cues to improve their awareness of their own learning affects, they also sought more explanations from their peers to understand the AI-generated results. Our findings not only provide novel design implications for promoting learners' meta-cognition with privacy-preserved social cues of peers' learning affects, but also suggest an expanded design framework for Explainable AI (XAI).

However, there has not been much work on designing social robots that aim to support both social engagement and behavior moderation, i.e., offering social interactions for engaging in behaviors without over-engagement. This work explores how social robots can moderate alcohol consumption while socially engaging them in a solitary drinking context. As alcohol consumption can have benefits when done in moderation, this companion robot aims to guide the user toward moderate drinking by using social engagement (i.e., creating an enjoyable atmosphere) and drinking moderation (i.e., regulating the drinking pace). Our preliminary user study (n=20) reveals that the robot is perceived as a friendly companion, and its human-likeness is partly attributed to the robot's intervention. Most participants followed the robot's guidance and perceived it as an intelligent friend due to its social interactions and behavior tracking features. We discuss the benefit of physical interactions for social engagement, utilizing interaction rituals for enjoyable but moderate commensality, and ethical considerations in solitary drinking contexts.",

      "abstract": "In the summer of 2021, users on the livestreaming platform Twitch experienced a wave of \"hate raids,\" a form of attack that overwhelms a target's chatroom with hateful messages, often with the aid of bots and automation. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we combine interviews with streamers and third-party bot developers with a quantitative measurement of this phenomenon across the platform. We present evidence that confirms that hate raids are highly-targeted, hate-driven attacks, but we also observe another mode of hate raid with similarities to networked harassment and subcultural trolling. We show that the streamers who self-identified as LGBTQ+ and/or Black were disproportionately targeted, and that the content of these hate raid messages were most commonly rooted in anti-Black racism and antisemitism. We also document how the threat of these attacks elicited both proactive and rapid, reactive community responses. These results have implications for future design of livestreaming platforms to better prepare for the experiences of at-risk communities in a way that is cognizant of a division of labor between community moderators, tool-builders, and platforms.",

      "abstract": "People work with AI systems to improve their decision making, but often under- or over-rely on AI predictions and perform worse than they would have unassisted. To help people appropriately rely on AI aids, we propose showing them behavior descriptions, details of how AI systems perform on subgroups of instances. We tested the efficacy of behavior descriptions through user studies with 225 participants in three distinct domains: fake review detection, satellite image classification, and bird classification. We found that behavior descriptions can increase human-AI accuracy through two mechanisms: helping people identify AI failures and increasing people's reliance on the AI when it is more accurate. These findings highlight the importance of people's mental models in human-AI collaboration and show that informing people of high-level AI behaviors can significantly improve AI-assisted decision making.",

This new landscape of online tools has the potential to provide work opportunities for people who are excluded from traditional workplaces due to inaccessible environments and work expectations. The present study involves an analysis of the work practices of 44 disabled creators who sell and promote their goods via online marketplaces. Through an analysis of publicly available content on Etsy and social media platforms, complemented with semi-structured interviews with a subset of creators, we report on the ways disabled sellers create, share and provide support through their practices. Our analysis reveals that creators move their work to an online space seeking more accessible ways to earn income, yet find themselves navigating access barriers that are enacted through platform norms, reward structures and algorithms. We discuss how online marketplaces present unique opportunities and challenges to participation for people with disabilities.",

      "abstract": "While birth control pills are one of the most common forms of contraception, their usage has several emotional and physical costs, such as taking the pill daily and experiencing hormonal side effects. The burden of these tasks in relationships generally falls on the pill user with minimal involvement from their partner. In this study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with pill users and their partners to investigate the differences between their perceived current and ideal divisions of birth control responsibility. During the interview, we presented a collaborative birth control tracking app prototype to examine how such technology can overcome these discrepancies. We found that pill users were unsatisfied with their partners' engagement in contraceptive tasks but did not communicate this well. Meanwhile, partners wanted to contribute more to pregnancy prevention but did not know how. When presented with our app prototype, users and partners stated that our design could address these issues by improving communication between users and partners. In particular, users appreciated how the app would increase engagement and support from their partner, and partners liked that the app presented several concrete ways to become more involved and show emotional support. However, privacy issues exist given the sensitive nature of contraception. We discuss how design considerations should be kept in mind about privacy while recognizing pill users' efforts and promoting partners' involvement.",

      "abstract": "Shortcomings of current models of moderation have driven policy makers, scholars, and technologists to speculate about alternative models of content moderation. While alternative models provide hope for the future of online spaces, they can fail without proper scaffolding. Community moderators are routinely confronted with similar issues and have therefore found creative ways to navigate these challenges. Learning more about the decisions these moderators make, the challenges they face, and where they are successful can provide valuable insight into how to ensure alternative moderation models are successful.   \r\n\r\nIn this study, I perform a collaborative ethnography with moderators of r/AskHistorians, a community that uses an alternative moderation model, highlighting the importance of accounting for power in moderation. Drawing from Black feminist theory, I call this  ``intersectional moderation.'' I focus on three controversies emblematic of r/AskHistorians' alternative model of moderation: a disagreement over a moderation decision; a collaboration to fight racism on Reddit; and a period of intense turmoil and its impact on policy. Through this evidence I show how volunteer moderators navigated multiple layers of power through care work. To ensure the successful implementation of intersectional moderation, I argue that designers should support decision-making processes and policy makers should account for the impact of the sociotechnical systems in which moderators work.

      "abstract": "Technology plays an increasingly pivotal role in mediating mental health support in people’s everyday lives. However, it is not clear how that mediation is occurring, to what end, and what technologies are implicated. In this study, we examine these questions with a mixed-methods analysis of conversations among participants in several Bipolar Disorder (BD) communities on Reddit. Analyzing posts produced over four years, we identify a wide variety of technologies that people employ to manage their mental conditions, such as communication technologies, online communities and tracking tools. Using this taxonomy of technologies as a framework, we then summarize three technology-mediated management strategies that these technologies enable, including serving as community, episode, and information mediators. We argue that with a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of people’s in situ technology use, we can identify research and design opportunities for designing human-centered technologies to help people manage mental health challenges more effectively.",

However, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and social computing research have pointed to instances where PD as practiced can, paradoxically, be exclusive. We aim to understand some of the challenges that could lead to exclusivity in order to design more inclusive PD practices. To investigate this, we conducted interviews with ten expert PD practitioners based in the Global North whose focus is on inclusion. Synthesizing practitioners’ accounts, we advance understandings of challenges surrounding: 1) instantiating shared spaces that empower partners; 2) developing common ground among stakeholders; and 3) balancing funding needs with open-ended PD. We contribute theoretical and empirical insights into these challenges and close by articulating potential implications for addressing these challenges to inclusion in PD.",

      "abstract": "As new forms of data capture emerge to power new AI applications, questions abound about the ethical implications of these data collection practices. In this paper, we present clinicians' perspectives on the prospective benefits and harms of voice data collection during health consultations. Such data collection is being proposed as a means to power models to assist clinicians with medical data entry, administrative tasks, and consultation analysis. Yet, clinicians' attitudes and concerns are largely absent from the AI narratives surrounding these use cases, and the academic literature investigating them. Our qualitative interview study used the concept of an informed consent process as a type of design fiction, to support elicitation of clinicians' perspectives on voice data collection and use associated with a fictional, near-term AI assistant. Through reflexive thematic analysis of in-depth sessions with physicians, we distilled eight classes of potential risks that clinicians are concerned about, including workflow disruptions, self-censorship, and errors that could impact patient eligibility for services. We conclude with an in-depth discussion of these prospective risks, reflect on the use of the speculative processes that illuminated them, and reconsider evaluation criteria for AI-assisted clinical documentation technologies in light of our findings.",

      "abstract": "By definition, people are reticent or even unwilling to talk about taboo subjects. Because subjects like sexuality, health, and violence are taboo in most cultures, important information on each of these subjects can be difficult to obtain. Are peer produced knowledge bases like Wikipedia a promising approach for providing people with information on taboo subjects? With its reliance on volunteers who might also be averse to taboo, can the peer production model produce high-quality information on taboo subjects? In this paper, we seek to understand the role of taboo in knowledge bases produced by volunteers. We do so by developing a novel computational approach to identify taboo subjects and by using this method to identify a set of articles on taboo subjects in English Wikipedia. We find that articles on taboo subjects are more popular than non-taboo articles and that they are frequently vandalize. Despite frequent vandalism attacks, we also find that taboo articles are higher quality than non-taboo articles. We hypothesize that stigmatizing societal attitudes will lead contributors to taboo subjects to seek to be less identifiable. Although our results are consistent with this proposal in several ways, we surprisingly find that contributors make themselves more identifiable in others.",

      "abstract": "As collaborative technologies evolve from supportive tools to interactive teammates, there is a growing need to understand how trust and team processes develop in human-agent teams. To contribute effectively, these systems must be able to support human teammates in a task without disrupting the delicate interpersonal states and team processes that govern successful collaboration. In order to break down the complexity of monitoring multiple actors in human-agent collaborations, there is a need to identify interpretable, generalizable measures that can monitor the emergence of interpersonal and team-level processes that underlie effective teaming. We address this gap by using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy to concurrently measure brain activity of two individuals in a human-human-agent team during a complex, ecologically valid collaborative task, with a goal of identifying quantitative markers of cognition- and affect-based trust alongside team processes of coordination, strategy formulation, and affect management. Two multidimensional extensions of recurrence quantification analysis, a nonlinear method based in dynamical systems theory, are presented to quantify interpersonal coupling and team-level regularity as reflected in the hemodynamics of three cortical regions across multiple time-scales. Mixed-effects regressions reveal that neural recurrence between individuals uniquely reflects changes in self-reported trust, while team-level neural regularity inversely predicts self-reported team processes. Additionally, we show that recurrence metrics capture temporal dynamics of affect-based trust consistent with existing theory, showcasing the interpretability and specificity of these metrics for disentangling complex team states and processes. This paper presents a novel, interpretable, and computationally efficient model-free method capable of differentiating between latent trust and team processes a complex, naturalistic task setting. We discuss the potential applications of this technique for continuous monitoring of team states, providing clear targets for the future development of adaptive human-agent teaming systems.",

We therefore conducted interviews and design workshops with 1) a group of care managers who support patients with complex health needs, and 2) their patients whose health needs include mental health concerns. We investigate both groups’ views of potential applications of digital tools within care management. Findings suggest that care managers felt underprepared to play an ongoing role in addressing mental health issues and had concerns about the burden and ambiguity of providing support through new digital channels. In contrast, patients envisioned benefiting from ongoing mental health support from care managers, including support in using digital tools. Patients’ and care managers’ needs may diverge such that meeting both through the same tools presents a significant challenge. We discuss how successful design and integration of digital tools into care management would require reconceptualizing these professionals’ roles in mental health support. ",

      "abstract": "A growing organizational trend is to utilize ad-hoc team formation which allows for teams to intentionally form based on the member skills required to accomplish a specific task. Due to the unfamiliar nature of these teams, teammates are often limited by their understanding of one another (e.g., teammate preferences, tendencies, attitudes) which limits the team’s functioning and efficiency. This study conceptualizes and investigates the use of a teammate information-sharing recommender system which selectively shares interpersonal recommendations between unfamiliar teammates (e.g., “Your voice may be overshadowed by this teammate when making decisions...\") to promote teammate understanding. Through a mixed-methods approach involving 105 participants working on actual unfamiliar teams, this study explores how presentation elements such as anonymity and explanations influence system perceptions and how anonymity influences team outcomes. Results indicate that anonymizing recommendations was associated with worse team measures, particularly team satisfaction and team cohesion. Qualitative results shed light on why team members perceived privacy concerns and team benefits associated with using the system. We contribute to CSCW through a better understanding of how to support unfamiliar teams, the conceptualization and empirical investigation of a novel teammate information-sharing recommender system, and foundational design recommendations associated with such a system.",

We provide empirical evidence about a politically balanced panel of lay raters' preferences for three potential platform actions on 368 news articles. \r\nOur results confirm that on many articles there is a lack of consensus on which actions to take. We find a clear hierarchy of perceived severity of actions with a majority of raters wanting informational labels on the most articles and removal on the fewest. \r\nThere was no partisan difference in terms of how many articles deserve platform actions but conservatives did prefer somewhat more action on content from liberal sources, and vice versa.

Our study brings attention to the challenge of developing effective misinformation warnings on short video-sharing platforms. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the think-aloud protocol to understand how users interact with and perceive misinformation warnings, specifically the interstitial and contextual warnings adopted by TikTok and Instagram Reels. We recruited 28 regular users of TikTok and Instagram Reels for this study. We contribute to the evolving scholarship on social media misinformation mitigation by casting light on nuanced participant interactions with and perceptions of misinformation warnings and how these interactions and perceptions influence the perceived accuracy of short video content. Our findings are threefold. First, the present study shows that specific contextual warnings do not always elicit behavioral adherence but can alert users to be vigilant about misinformation. Second, users’ perceptions of interstitial and contextual warnings are influenced by the warning’s explicitness and the risk level of the misinformation. Third, we identify the least and most effective/favored warning designs to help make accuracy judgments according to the participants. To this end, our findings have implications for improving the design of misinformation warnings on short video-sharing platforms.",

      "abstract": "Recently, AI is integrating into teams to collaborate with humans as a teammate with the goal of achieving unprecedented team outcomes. Much of the coordination between humans and AI teammates relies on human-AI communication, which is challenging due to AI's limitations on natural language communication. Thus, it is essential to identify and develop effective communication strategies for AI teammates in human-AI teams to facilitate the coordination process. Through interviews with 60 participants who collaborated with an AI teammate in a multiplayer online game, in this paper, we explore communication strategies that humans expect AI teammates to apply to support human-AI coordination and collaboration in dyadic teaming environments, and how the AI teammate's communication can impact teaming processes. Our findings highlight four communication strategies AI teammates should apply to support their coordination with humans in dyadic teaming environments. We also find that AI teammates' proactive communication with humans could facilitate the development of human trust and situation awareness, whereas AI lacking such proactive communication is often not perceived as a teammate. Our study extends the current CSCW/HCI research on human-AI communication in teaming environments by shedding light on how communication should be structured in dyadic human-AI teams for effective and smooth collaboration.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the emerging safety risks in nuanced social VR spaces and how existing safety features are used is crucial for building safe and inclusive 3D virtual worlds in the future. Prior research on safety risks in social VR is mainly based on interview or survey data of social VR users' experiences and perceptions, which lacks \"in-situ observations'' about how people actually react to these risks. In this paper, we aim to understand safety risks and safety design in social VR environments using two empirical studies. In Study 1, we conducted content analysis of 212 YouTube videos and the associated transcripts that document social VR users' first hand experiences of safety risks in social VR environments in the moment (e.g., as victims, attackers, or bystanders). We also investigated viewers' reactions to these risks by analyzing comments to these videos posted online (i.e., spectators). In Study 2, we identified 13 safety features across various social VR platforms and mapped how each existing safety feature in social VR can address the risks identified in Study 1. Our findings call for re-approaching safety risks based on the uniqueness of social VR interaction dynamics and users' multi-modal simulated reactions to such risks. We also propose three safety protection mechanisms for designing future social VR environments: the use of non-player character (NPC) as a safety educator, intuitive gesture-based safety triggers, and improvements for avatar and voice control.",

      "abstract": "Recent developments in explainable AI (XAI) aim to improve the transparency of black-box models. However, empirically evaluating the interpretability of these XAI techniques is still an open challenge. The most common evaluation method is algorithmic performance, but such an approach may not accurately represent how interpretable these techniques are to people. A less common but growing evaluation strategy is to leverage crowd-workers to provide feedback on multiple XAI techniques to compare them. However, these tasks often feel like work and may limit participation. We propose a novel, playful, human-centered method for evaluating XAI techniques: a Game With a Purpose (GWAP), Eye into AI, that allows researchers to collect human evaluations of XAI at scale. We provide an empirical study demonstrating how our GWAP supports evaluating and comparing the agreement between three popular XAI techniques (LIME, Grad-CAM, and Feature Visualization) and humans, as well as evaluating and comparing the interpretability of those three XAI techniques on applied to a deep learning model for image classification. The data collected from Eye into AI offers convincing evidence that GWAPs can be used to evaluate and compare XAI techniques.",

This paper investigates end users’ perspectives on personal content moderation tools by conducting an interview study with a diverse sample of 24 active social media users. We probe interviewees’ preferences using simulated personal moderation interfaces, including word filters, sliders for toxicity levels, and boolean toxicity toggles. We also examine the labor involved for users in choosing moderation settings and present users’ attitudes about the roles and responsibilities of social media platforms and other stakeholders towards moderation. We discuss how our findings can inform design solutions to improve transparency and controllability in personal content moderation tools.",

      "abstract": "Employees work in increasingly digital environments that enable advanced analytics. Yet, they lack oversight over the systems that process their data. That means that potential analysis errors or hidden biases are hard to uncover. Recent data protection legislation tries to tackle these issues, but it is inadequate. It does not prevent data misusage while at the same time stifling sensible use cases for data.\r\n\r\nWe think the conflict between data protection and increasingly data-driven systems should be solved differently. When access to an employees' data is given, all usages should be made transparent to them, according to the concept of inverse transparency. This allows individuals to benefit from sensible data usage while addressing the potentially harmful consequences of data misusage. To accomplish this, we propose a new design approach for workforce analytics software we refer to as inverse transparency by design.\r\n\r\nTo understand the developer and user perspectives on the proposal, we conduct two exploratory studies with students. First, we let small teams of developers implement analytics tools with inverse transparency by design to uncover how they judge the approach and how it materializes in their developed tools. We find that architectural changes are made without inhibiting core functionality. The developers consider our approach valuable and technically feasible. Second, we conduct a user study over three months to let participants experience the provided inverse transparency and reflect on their experience. The study models a software development workplace where most work processes are already digital. Participants perceive the transparency as beneficial and feel empowered by it. They unanimously agree that it would be an improvement for the workplace. We conclude that inverse transparency by design is a promising approach to realize accepted and responsible people analytics.",

      "abstract": "Online music platforms that embed social features are enabling the creation of supportive social communities where many young people disclose their distressing feelings and seek support. However, there is a limited understanding of the content young people disclose or the support they may provide in such social music communities. In this work, using a large online music platform as our research site, we employed mixed methods to analyze users' comments (N=163) and the associated replies (N=2,732) related to young people's psychological distress (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness). We found that experience sharing dominates the types of comments, which often invokes peers' support in the form of encouragement, caring, or self-disclosure. Furthermore, we conducted an interview study with 13 young people to understand their perceptions of and motives for disclosure and support on our research site. The interviewees expressed that music-induced and comment-induced emotional resonance is the main drive for their disclosure and support. Finally, we discuss design implications for a supportive social music community that could benefit youth mental health.",

      "abstract": "Chatbot-based symptom checker (CSC) apps have become increasingly popular in healthcare. These apps engage users in human-like conversations and offer possible medical diagnoses. The conversational design of these apps can significantly impact user perceptions and experiences, and may influence medical decisions users make and the medical care they receive. However, the effects of the conversational design of CSCs remain understudied, and there is a need to investigate and enhance users’ interactions with CSCs. In this article, we conducted a two-stage exploratory study using a human-centered design methodology. We first conducted a qualitative interview study to identify key user needs in engaging with CSCs. We then performed an experimental study to investigate potential CSC conversational design solutions based on the results from the interview study. We identified that emotional support, explanations of medical information, and efficiency were important factors for users in their interactions with CSCs. We also demonstrated that emotional support and explanations could affect user perceptions and experiences, and they are context-dependent. Based on these findings, we offer design implications for CSC conversations to improve the user experience and health-related decision-making.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) has opened up new possibilities for people to access language resources at their fingertips. Patterns of language can be difficult to derive from large-scaled documents previously, which impedes people to process and extract information contained. Observations from common users' practices and experiences suggest that LLM may appear to possess certain capacities on processing, handling and working with not just human language, but also the associated knowledge. However, the original construction of LLM is essentially language-centric, which is not more than a probabilistic model representing and summarizing language patterns from large language corpora, without deliberately incorporating other types of data or information (e.g., user behaviors, domain concepts) into the model construction. However, when using LLM in the real-world, it's not uncommon to appropriate and re-purpose a LLM for handling tasks that don't necessarily match what it's built for. In this poster, we present an exploratory study aimed at understanding how people interact with a LLM, chatGPT, to obtain instructions to work on a problem-solving task, installing Python on a remote computer. The results reveal that users' literacy and expectations regarding LLM can influence how they perceive and utilize it. Surprisingly, low-literacy participants with limited understanding of LLM appear to benefit more, producing implications on designing user-centric AI/ML tools.",

Mobile crowdsourcing, where on-site individuals offer real-time details, is a potential solution. Yet it is unclear whether users would prefer to utilizing the mobile crowd on site to verify sensor data or to provide supplementary explanations for inconsistent sensor data. We conducted an online experiment involving 100 participants to explore this question. Our results revealed a negative correlation between perceived plausibility of sensor information and inclination to use mobile crowdsourcing for obtaining information. However, only around 80% of participants relied on crowdsourcing when they felt the sensor information as implausible. Interestingly, even when participants believed the sensor data to be plausible, they sought to use crowdsourcing for further details half of the time. We also found that participants leaned more towards using the crowd for explanations (48% and 49% of instances) rather than seeking verification when encountering perceived implausible sensor information (38% and 32% of instances).",

Given that most of these fitness services are self-paced, users' satisfaction with personalized exercises would greatly influence their commitment and engagement with the service. However, users' expectations of AI-generated workouts consisting of various body-weight movements have yet to be explored within the HCI community. In this paper, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz experiment for two weeks with 12 participants to investigate users' expectations of AI-generated body-weight exercises.

We designed and built a mobile app to support healthy family dynamics through behavioral parent management and skills development, intended to serve as an accessible alternative to traditional intervention programs. We conducted semi-structured interviews and usability evaluations of our app with seven families with adolescents. Interviews centered around modules in the app for planning and maintaining adolescents' morning routine and monitoring adolescents' activities and whereabouts. While the app was not designed to support a specific parenting style, findings demonstrated the app's potential to encourage authoritative parenting by balancing adolescent autonomy with parental support and monitoring. By modeling parental monitoring around communication-based information solicitation and disclosure rather than tracking and surveillance, we also found that the app could help to diffuse parent-adolescent conflict and tension.",

We present the findings of a qualitative content analysis of the most popular climate change posts (tagged with #ClimateChange) on Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. Over four weeks in Spring 2022, we collected the top five weekly posts (n = 60) to understand how they address animals and emotions and relate to teens’ perceptions of climate change online based on prior survey work with 100 American teens. Our research reveals that more than a quarter (26.7%) of all analyzed posts relate to animals, and many (87.5%) employ negative language when discussing animals. We offer recommendations to enhance online climate change communication for teens, foster pro-environmental behaviors, attitudes, and activism, and study social media discourse across platforms. We highlight the need for further research on youth, climate change, and social media.",

      "abstract": "Voice agents play a crucial role in providing verbal instructions for successful evacuation in emergency situations. However, the vocal presentation of emotion is context-dependent and the impact of emotional cues presented by voice agents in an emergency setting remains unexplored. This study compared the effects of voice agents' emotional expressions conveyed through tone (i.e., calm vs. urgent) during a fire emergency simulation. Participants (N=30) conducted an online simulation game where a voice agent instruct them on how to evacuate from a building, while their evacuation time was tracked. After the game, participants evaluated the task experience and the voice agent's trustworthiness and context-appropriateness. Using an urgent voice for the agent increased the participants' perception of cognitive trust in the agent and context-appropriateness to the emergency, compared to using a calm voice. The study findings provide design implications for a voice agent's emergency instructions, aiming for an effective evacuation process.",

Many see it as a new  communication mechanism through which people can come together in a way they have never been able to via traditional online interfaces. However, much is still unknown about how VR may affect how groups of users communicate. In this work, we present preliminary findings on how avatars, the customization choices users make to create them, and user perception of them may affect feelings of work group inclusion. We study this in the context of a formal classroom setting with work groups comprised of students. Avatars are known to transform user perception and behavior in virtual environments -- both immersive and non-immersive -- and can dictate the way social interactions play out in these scenarios. We produce results that align with this paradigm, showing that elements of work group inclusion are different between the physical world and VR, and that customization choices and user perceptions of avatars may shape the perception of inclusion.",

We include provocations to the research community on how the patterns we identify might inform the public's view on this topic, and considerations for how they might also improve our own reporting of research.",

One particular group that has received some recent attention from HCI and CSCW researchers is fat people and, relatedly, anti-fatness.  However, more work is needed to understand how to ethically engage in research with fat people--for example, in studying online communities or designing technology. Toward this goal, we provide a brief introduction to fat people, fat activism, and fat oppression so researchers may understand the social, political, and historical landscape in which research with and about fat people takes place. Based on empirical findings from an interview study, we then provide recommendations for researchers wishing to engage fat people in future research.",

Two core steps, \"lift up the previous\" and \"fix and maintain\", can lead to muscle fatigue in the upper limbs. In this paper, we develop a human-in-the-loop based human-robot collaboration system that provides real-time force feedback to restorers based on their muscle load and motion intention, with the support strength changing to relieve fatigue. Different robot-aided positions on human arm are explored and a two-point elbow-supporting mechanism is evaluated as the optimal solution. Moreover, a novel muscle load calculation model is developed to integrate human factors into the HRC system with electromyography. The results of a usability experiment show the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing the current anti-fatigue challenge in heritage paintings and calligraphy restoration.",

To address this challenge, we present ConceptCombo, a video navigating interface facilitating user explorations of unstructured video collections with conceptual structures and themes of social comments extracted from videos and visualized by the system. To help novices identify a series of useful videos to watch, ConceptCombo aims to provide a structured view of the video collection by systematically extracting a concept map from the video contents, as well as by automatically summarizing and integrating users' comments left across different videos as a treemap visualization. With ConceptCombo, novices may take a synergistic approach to explore videos, as supported by underlying semantic structure of video content, social comments, and other video metadata.",

People with low digital literacy lack this knowledge, causing difficulties and exclusion from the digital society. In this research project, we focus on Design for Learnability as a new paradigm that challenges the state of the art in UX Design to foster inclusion and participation.\r\n\r\nTo empower this group, so called Hybrid Anchor Points are established in local communities. We use an Interactive Tabletop Projection (ITP), which facilitates access to simplify participation. Further it allows for collaborative exploration and learning, taking into account the needs of people with low digital literacy, focusing on first-use learnability, during-use support and low cognitive load. A pilot study showed a significant reduction in user errors and help interventions.\r\n\r\nThis research shows that design for learnability, combined with an ITP, can simplify access to the digital society and further advance inclusion and participation.",

      "abstract": "The collaborative Qualitative Analysis (CQA) process can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring multiple discussions among team members to refine codes and ideas before reaching a consensus. We introduce DiffCoder, a system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to support three CQA stages: independent open coding, iterative discussions, and the development of a final codebook. In the independent open coding phase, DiffCoder provides AI-generated code suggestions on demand, and allows users to record coding decision-making information (e.g. keywords and certainty) as support for the process. During the discussion phase, DiffCoder helps to build mutual understanding and productive discussion by sharing coding decision-making information with the team. It also helps to quickly identify agreements and disagreements through quantitative metrics, in order to build a final consensus. During the code grouping phase, DiffCoder employs a top-down approach for primary code group recommendations, reducing the cognitive burden of generating the final codebook.",

Peer-support interventions have proven to be effective for veterans because of their shared experience and community. However, as veterans might face a mental health crisis at any time, it is crucial that the mentors can identify their peers' crisis warning signs early enough. Mobile technology has the potential to facilitate and improve peer-to-peer communication. Gaining an understanding of how the veteran community perceives crisis symptoms, as well as their values and technological needs, bears utmost importance in creating any tool or adopting any strategy. Hence, we conducted a mixed-methods study with twelve peer mentor military veterans. Our research offers an in-depth understanding of the nuanced conceptions of mentor veterans about early warning signals and acute mental health crisis symptoms, as well as aspects of technology that may aid this community in recognizing and managing these symptoms.",

Previous studies focused on developing tools that enable model developers to view the carbon intensity of the ML models in the training process. Still, little is known about how to support ML developers in online communities to explore the carbon intensity of ML models during inference. We developed MIEV, a model inference emission visualizer, that supports ML developers on TensorFlow Hub to explore the carbon intensity of image domain models during the model inference phase. We also provide insights into designing technologies that promote collaborative work among ML developers to drive sustainable AI development processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to interactively visualize the carbon intensity of ML models in online communities during the inference phase.",

      "abstract": "Embodied Pedagogical Agents (EPAs) possess significant potential for using multimodal interactions to effectively convey social and educational information. While previous studies have examined the impact of EPAs on learning performance, the incorporation of meaningful gestures into EPAs remains relatively unexplored. This study employs a case study approach and systemic functional-multimodal discourse analysis to investigate the multimodal interactions of a human lecturer during teaching and explores the relationship between in-class meaningful gestures and corresponding words. We analyze the alignment between gestures, words, and contextual meanings, with a specific focus on personal pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs. The findings contribute to the understanding of lecturers' multimodal orchestration in classroom settings. Additionally, we provide a preliminary design guideline for EPAs that integrates meaningful word-synchronized gestures, using multimodal information to enhance students' embodied learning experiences. This research contributes to the advancement of embodied pedagogical agent design and the broader field of multimodal interaction.",

We begin by understanding Sylvia Wynter’s definition of the biocentric Man genre and its exclusion of Blackness from\r\nhumanness. We follow this with outlining what we consider to be the typical steps for developing an AI-based technology, which we’ve broken\r\ndown into 6 stages: identifying a problem, development process and management tool selection, dataset development and data processing, model\r\ndevelopment, deployment and risk assessment, and integration and monitoring. The goal of this paper is to better understand how Wynter’s\r\nbiocentric Man is being represented and reinforced by the technologies we are producing in the AI lifecycle and by the lifecycle itself; we hope to\r\nidentify ways in which the distinction of Blackness from the ‘ideal’ human leads to perpetual punishment at the hands of these technologies. By\r\ndeconstructing this development process, we can potentially identify ways in which humans in general have not been prioritized and how those\r\naffects are disproportionately affecting marginalized people. We hope to offer solutions that will encourage changes in the AI development cycle.",

To address this, we introduce ChatGPT-generated value scenarios, an extension of scenario-based design that supports critical, systemic, long-term thinking in current design practice, technology development, and deployment. Using our proposed method, we created a prompt to generate value scenarios on ChatGPT. %Two examples of ChatGPT-generated value scenarios drawn from prior work on North Korean defectors with depression. Based on our analysis of the generated scenarios, we identified that ChatGPT could generate plausible information about Value Implications. However, it lacks details on Pervasiveness and Systemic Effects. After discussing the limitations and opportunities of ChatGPT in generating value scenarios, we conclude with suggestions for how ChatGPT might be better used to generate value scenarios.",

Yet, how social and linguistic factors, such as the identities of interlocutors and the language framing of posts, can influence discussions around norms, is underexplored. In this work, we performed a preliminary analysis based on a dataset containing 123 question threads on Meta Stack Overflow, a site for discussions of the workings and policies of Stack Overflow, to understand how people initiate and respond to norms-related discussions. Results revealed that question posts with different levels of personal relatedness and question specificity have significantly different sentiments, and they also draw comments with diverged sentiments.

      "abstract": "Femtech entails a growing category of digital tools and services— including mobile apps, wearables, and internet-connected devices— designed to help women track their personal, reproductive, and sexual health. Entrusted by millions of users to track menstrual cycles, ovulation windows, and plan or prevent pregnancies, these apps collect large amounts of deeply personal data. In the U.S., femtech—and how it collects, stores, and discloses data—is largely unregulated, and users are left to trust the policies and promises made by femtech providers to protect their privacy. In light of the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion, many femtech users are now worried that their personal health data could be used against them in criminal and civil proceedings. In this poster, we provide preliminary findings of whether user concerns over data privacy have changed since the \\textit{Dobbs} decision in June 2022, through a thematic and sentiment analysis of user reviews of femtech apps in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. We then point to ways femtech platforms could address such concerns through privacy-by-design and changes to privacy policies.",

The findings from semi-structured interviews revealed that the personalized and asynchronous nature of OTT streaming could lead to reduced social communication opportunities before, during, and after drama-viewing experiences. In particular, participants expressed difficulties in finding companions to co-watch dramas, a lack of simultaneous emotional communication with others, and concerns about spoilers. To address these challenges, we proposed three solution ideas and evaluated them in follow-up interviews. Based on our findings, we discuss design implications for promoting social interaction between OTT drama viewers.\r\n",

We conducted a case study alongside a STEM education nonprofit based in Chicago to explore how 9 young adults brought in and engaged with personal objects in the co-design of a “Safe Spaces” event for peers. We found that the personal objects helped inform participants’ designs, structure the conversation, and foster inclusion and common ground. We provide suggestions for how to support users bringing in and using personal objects as design materials. ",

We follow two frameworks to describe the narrative elements (characters, spatial dimension, sequentiality \\& temporality, and tellability) of the dashboard. This narrative analysis allows us to characterize the narrative work that urban dashboards do, enabling the interpretation that produces meaning from data. Given the duality of data and data visualization and their primacy in both directing and critiquing racialized state power, this poster argues that understanding narrative is vital to determining how, when, and why particular kinds of data visualizations might serve authentic community-defined political goals and when they do not. We aim to start a line of inquiry into how analytic attention to narrative in data visualization can support political change through agonistic data practices.",

Communication holds an immense and difficult workload due to the complicated content, limited meeting time, vast audience backgrounds, etc. Thus, it is almost impossible to build a common ground within the team. Taking a step back, flowcharts and program descriptions have shown to help programmers learn algorithms. However, drawing a flowchart or writing a description takes time and effort. The novel AI-powered search engines can generate elaborate grounded responses with citations. It is then possible to generate flowcharts with text descriptions from code. Therefore, we studied 92 DS flowcharts and 173 code descriptions from top-voted Kaggle notebooks. We propose NBGuru, a flowchart-based communication tool. Users can explore computation steps asynchronously with generated texts and citations. Furthermore, we also discuss the possibility of AI in other collaborative roles.",

However, a research gap exists on how to tailor those systems by maximizing flexibility based on human needs and preferences. This study proposes a schematic human-AI co-creation framework to maximize system flexibility and enhance creative outcome generation. The framework proposes the involvement of AI in three levels of creation and allows humans to adjust between the levels anytime during the creative process based on their preferences. We tentatively define how AI should collaborate at the three levels. To implement the framework, a co-creation system (GSM) was built to support humans in creating sculpture maquettes with AI. It includes three key components: a prompt-based generated model (DALL·E), advanced computer vision, and robotic arms. A user interface is provided to ensure transparency. Preliminary user studies have demonstrated that the system enhances flexibility and allows users to generate more creative maquettes.",

We found that people have unique views of and contexts for gratitude and discussed how the unique views and contexts relate to concerns they have around expressing gratitude in an online community. We describe plans for a follow-up study to better understand people’s views on expressing gratitude in an online community through the use of Gratitude, a simple online communal gratitude platform where users interact in ways similar to many online communities, through creating short posts (e.g., notes of gratitude) that other members can browse, react to, and comment on.

      "abstract": "We describe the design of an immersive virtual Cyberball task that included avatar customization, and user feedback on this design. We first created a prototype of an avatar customization template and added it to a Cyberball prototype built in the Unity3D game engine. Then, we conducted in-depth user testing and feedback sessions with 15 Cyberball stakeholders: five naive participants with no prior knowledge of Cyberball and ten experienced researchers with extensive experience using the Cyberball paradigm. We report the divergent perspectives of the two groups on the following design insights; designing for intuitive use, inclusivity, and realistic experiences versus minimalism. Participant responses shed light on how system design problems may contribute to or perpetuate negative experiences when customizing avatars. They also demonstrate the value of considering multiple stakeholders' feedback in the design process for virtual reality, presenting a more comprehensive view in designing future Cyberball prototypes and interactive systems for social science research.",

      "abstract": "Shared decision-making (SDM) is a central feature of clinical practice guidelines, and it is a key way to improve long-term communication and relationships between older adult patients and physicians. Previous studies have found that patients’ engagement in decision-making is closely associated with patient satisfaction and with improved treatment outcomes. However, medical decision-making can be complex. Healthcare often requires decisions that are time-sensitive, and when confronted with multiple possible treatments it is necessary to carefully assess the impact of each treatment on health outcomes and to consider potential harms as well as benefits. Effective communication tools can be useful for conducting this assessment in a shared fashion. In the current project, we conducted interviews with 12 participants, including seven older adults with chronic diseases and five clinicians who work with this patient population, with the goal of better understanding both groups’ perspectives and needs in the clinical setting. The interviews focused on the potential benefits that can be derived from an SDM-based technological platform, and the findings can be useful in the future design of such a platform.",

However, new digital threats have emerged as AR/VR usage increases such as data exchange in shared spaces. Prior research on graphical authentication has proposed the Things scheme [ 21 ] and we plan to adapt this in the AR/VR domain. The scheme in combination with the private display available to users in AR/VR is resistant to shoulder-surfing attacks. Inspired by the work of Duezguen et al. [ 12 ], who conducted a user study applying the Things scheme in AR with 16 users in Germany, this short paper proposes a replication study that will implement the Things scheme in both AR and VR. We will recruit eligible participants for the in-lab study which will involve the use of HoloLens and Valve Index to test the Things scheme and we will evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme, the interaction modes for usability, and users’ risk perception concerning security. Additionally, we will conduct a comparative analysis of cross-cultural disparities between the participants in Germany and in the USA.",

However, academic institutions often fail to keep up with the rapid changes in professional practice in preparing their students. To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five nursing faculties in the USA. In our study, we examined the current status of digital technology and privacy education, and identified the challenges in adequately preparing nursing students to embrace and adapt to the changes in digital technology use at healthcare organizations. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights for the CSCW community to better understand the challenges in academia, in order to mitigate the gap between academic preparation and professional needs of nurses in using digital technologies. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to address these issues.",

To this end, we created a low-fidelity prototype with designs of existing Google's parental control for Google Assistant termed as a baseline, along with our features deriving from prior literature termed as treatment. Then, we conducted a semi-structured interview with 7 parents to understand their perceptions, needs, and expectations surrounding parental control within digital assistants. As reflected in our results, digital assistants can play different roles in stimulating open communication between parents and children, augmenting parenting responsibilities to induce self-regulation and impulse control in children, and setting boundaries with granularity.

We explored people’s ability to infer personal information about others from representations of nonverbal behavior data tracked in VR. We conducted a within-subject experiment with 53 participants to explore if they could guess personal information from gestures, spatial behavior, and a combination of both represented through neutral avatars in VR. We found that participants could not guess better than random for most features, except for age and native English speaker status. Furthermore, there were almost no differences between the various types of behavior, except for native English speaker status. We discuss how our results contradict previous research on people's identification from nonverbal behavior.

      "abstract": "A legal agreement is a type of procedural document that describes the steps that parties must take to fulfill legal obligations. Following these steps requires human interpretation, which is often inefficient and error prone. For a Small to Medium Sized Business (SMB), this process is laborious. We conduct an interview study to understand how information in PDF agreements is currently understood, processed, and acted upon by SMB employees working in small teams of non-domain experts. Through qualitative analysis and a text highlighting activity, we observe knowledge transfer workflows in SMBs and propose design principles for using AI-extracted information to create actionable documents that address gaps in efficiency, understanding, and agency.  \r\n",

      "abstract": "Federated social networking is an increasingly popular alternative to more traditional, centralized forms. Yet, this federated arrangement can lead to dramatically different experiences across the network. Using a sample of the most popular instances on the federated social network Mastodon, we characterize the types of rules present in this emerging space. We then compare these rules to those on Reddit, as an example of a different, less centralized space. Rules on Mastodon often pay particular attention to issues of harassment and hate --- strongly reflecting the spirit of the Mastodon Covenant. We speculate that these rules may have emerged in response to problems of other platforms, and reflect a lack of support for instance maintainers. With this work, we call for the development of additional instance-level governance and technical scaffolding, and raise questions for future work into the development, values, and value tensions present in the broader federated social networking landscape.",

      "abstract": "The human-computer interaction community has a long tradition of conducting research in healthcare settings. We conducted a systematic review of how race is defined and discussed in healthcare-focused HCI research. Beginning with an initial set of 514 articles drawn from two major HCI venues, we applied exclusion criteria resulting in a data set of 29 articles. We found considerable variation in definitions of race across articles, with some focusing on skin color, others on sociocultural differences, and still others not providing any explicit definition of race. This variation was further reflected in the method used to identify participants race and the level of specificity used in categorizing participants' race and ethnicity. Additionally, many articles engagement with race and racial disparities in minor ways, with some articles proposing racial equity as an avenue for future work without attending to race in their current investigation. Finally, we found that most articles studied patients and end users, leaving unexamined the practices and perspectives of healthcare practitioners and institutions. We conclude with suggestions advocating greater clarity and consciousness around race, racism, and racial disparities in healthcare focused HCI research.",

However, limited research has explored users' perceptions on AI outputs, especially for AI mistakes. Unexpected outputs from AI might lead to frustration and negative emotions. Thus, this work aims to investigate how AI outputs influence people's perceptions and experiences in their everyday practice, particularly when they are given the opportunity to correct AI mistakes. In this work, we developed an AI-powered system capable of recognizing six types of beverages based on a photo and generating a data report summarizing people's drinking behaviors. We conducted a study with 14 participants to understand user perception, experience and trust on AI predictions. Results showed that participants had higher trust on the system when given ability to modify AI outputs. Interestingly, incorrect predictions made by AI sparked people's curiosity, leading them to speculate on the underlying reasons behind the AI model.",

Its current practice is also extremely laborious and costly. In this paper, we explore what fresh ideas CSCW might have to offer for making effective synthesis less painful and more commonplace. In particular, we draw on CSCW ideas around distributed sensemaking and integrated crowdsourcing to explore the idea of distributed synthesis: systems for sharing and reusing intermediate synthesis materials such as annotations and notes to kickstart and accelerate the synthesis process. We report in-progress findings from our analysis of in-depth guided tours of scholarly synthesis work practices, to bridge the gap between distributed sensemaking and integrated crowdsourcing (which has not yet been studied in the setting of scholarly synthesis) and scholarly synthesis workflows (which have not yet been analyzed from a distributed lens).",

However, most of these works only focus on sleep tracking and reminding. The social perspective of sleep is rarely explored. We believe that sleep is tightly associated with social connection and intimacy. This work explores how sleep sharing can facilitate social bonding over a distance. We present SleepyFlora, an interactive system that enables a user to know the other user's real-time sleep stages via a flower-shaped installation and augment their sleep by sending soothing aromas and playing music remotely. With SleepyFlora, we hope to further the understanding of interaction design around sleep by considering its social perspective. Moreover, we hope our work can provide a novel approach, i.e, enabling sleep sharing, for facilitating social bonding over a distance.",

Using a statistical analysis, we examine the impacts that this outsized attention has on the subsequent behavior of accounts who received sudden social media attention for Twitter posts in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. We find that accounts that received sudden social media attention were more likely to post after receiving sudden social media attention, though this effect was not persistent and did not boost original content production. We also find that these accounts were significantly more likely to alter their self-presentation through updating their “bio” after receiving suddenly increased attention.",

In this study, we aimed at understanding the potential of leveraging metaphor in password meter design to grab user attention, keep them engaged with the interface, and make them feel connected with the design. To this end, we created four metaphor-based designs (treatment conditions) and compared them with a control condition representing a typical password meter. The findings from our between-subject study with 130 participants, conducted over Amazon Mechanical Turk, provide valuable insights into the opportunities of metaphor-based password meter design. Our study unpacks the role of aesthetic in password meter design, as well as how user engagement contributes to their focus on password strength. We suggest future studies to further explore, refine, and evaluate metaphor-based design choices towards helping users with security decisions.\r\n",

Existing work does not study how rules change within a subreddit, and when different types of rules are added since subreddit creation. As current datasets lack information about subreddits’ past rules, we present an approach to get all rules in the history of a subreddit using the Wayback Machine, and study rule trajectories within 496 subreddits. We find that at least 50% of the first rule additions occurred in less than a year from subreddit creation. Rules about civility and relevance are most common in the first rules. In contrast, rules that prohibit certain content are frequently added over time. Studying rule trajectories can help us answer whether early rule establishment helps with community success, improving key factors like user retention, norm compliance, and overall desirable behavior within the subreddit.",

Our primary goal was to inform the first participatory design workshop of Sound of Care, a new eHealth system for pain self-management. We used an ethical stakeholder analysis to inform a round of exploratory interviews, run with 8 participants including people with chronic primary pain, carers, and healthcare workers. We found that sound and technology serve as important but often unstructured tool, helping with distraction, mood regulation and sleep. The experience of pain and musical preferences are highly personal, and communicating or understanding pain can be challenging, even within family members. To address the gaps in current chronic pain self-management care, we propose the use a sound-based AI-driven system, a Digital Pain Companion, using sonification to create a shared decision-making space, enhancing agency ver treatment in a co-operative care environment.",

The current study examines the use of a gender-swapped avatar in a virtual job interview that affects the applicants' perceptions and their performance evaluated by recruiters. With a mixed-method approach, we first conducted a lab experiment (N=8) exploring how using a gender-swapped avatar in a virtual job interview impacts perceived anxiety, confidence, competence, and ability to perform. Then, a semi-structured interview investigated the participants’ VR interview experiences using an avatar. Our findings suggest that using gender-swapped avatars may reduce the anxiety that job applicants will experience during the interview. Also, the affinity diagram produced seven key themes highlighting the advantages and limitations of VR as an interview platform. These findings contribute to the emerging field of VR-based recruitment and have practical implications for promoting diversity and inclusion in the hiring process.",

      "abstract": "Academic reading is a key component of higher education, serving as a basis for critical thinking, knowledge acquisition and effective communication. Many students struggle with comprehension and analysis tasks with academic texts, and only 20-30% of undergraduates complete required readings, despite its central importance to success in higher education. Oftentimes, students struggle to critically engage and subsequently attain merely a cursory understanding of a paper's contents, or worse, incorrectly interpret the text. How, then, can we provide a means to more easily digest a text whilst also facilitating critical engagement? We introduce ReaderQuizzer, an augmented reading interface that leverages an LLM to intelligently generate learning questions for academic papers, thereby making them more digestible with the end goal of facilitating deeper understanding, and developing critical reading skills. An evaluation study of 16 undergraduates using ReaderQuizzer saw an increase in engagement, information retention, identification of key concepts, and aided overall comprehension. ",

      "abstract": "Analyzing open-ended survey responses is a crucial yet challenging task for social scientists, non-profit organizations, and educational institutions, as they often face the trade-off between obtaining rich data and the burden of reading and coding textual responses. This demo introduces FeedbackMap, a web-based tool that uses natural language processing techniques to facilitate the analysis of open-ended survey responses. FeedbackMap lets researchers generate summaries at multiple levels, identify interesting response examples, and visualize the response space through embeddings.   We discuss the importance of examining survey results from multiple perspectives and the potential biases introduced by summarization methods, emphasizing the need for critical evaluation of the representation and omission of respondent voices.",

People experience challenges keeping up with the discussion and misunderstanding frequently occurs. To solve these challenges, we present MeetScript, a system that provides parallel participation channels through real-time interactive transcripts. MeetScript visualizes the discussion through a chat-alike interface and allows meeting attendees to make real-time collaborative annotations. Over time, MeetScript gradually hides extraneous content to retain the essential information on the transcript, with the goal of reducing the cognitive load required on users to process the information in real-time.

However, they often become responsible for extending and amplifying similar hate and prejudice the communities face outside these spaces. We focus our research efforts on BTS ARMY, a playful community often misunderstood, and subject to discrimination due to the majority of members identifying as both women and racially diverse. We adopt a value-sensitive approach to unearth BTS ARMY's values and study their manifestations on social platforms from a survey on social media platforms. Through inductive qualitative coding methods, fundamental values were identified: Respect, Love, and Community. In this work, we center this community's values and experiences and present provocations prompting readers to re-think designing online social spaces for playful marginalized communities.",

However, the solutions have primarily focused on managing the negative emotions of informal caregivers. Informal caregivers go through a range of emotional experiences, which are often invisible to others. In this work, we aim to use the context of informal caregiving needs and experiences to understand how we can design future Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for supporting emotion work. We conducted user studies and interviews to understand what informal caregivers perceive as emotion work in two caregiving contexts: parenting and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Based on the findings, we propose a framework for generating design requirements for AI systems that support emotion work. Our work contributes to how we can design AI to support people's practices that involve emotion work.",

Its main computational system analyzes the volume and frequency of sound from various musical instruments (piano, percussion, synthesizers, etc.) and converts them into diverse audio-visual responses. These include randomly selected radio signals, the brightness of bulbs, as well as the intensity of glitches in lady images on the screen, depicted in the style of Andy Warhol's pop art.",

      "abstract": "Users are often unaware of the information that applications collect and are surprised by unexpected data collection and sharing practices. With numerous third-party applications on Facebook potentially accessing the personal information of billions of users, it is essential to understand users' mental models of data sharing to help them make informed decisions. To achieve this, we conducted semi-structured interviews using drawings and think-aloud protocol with 32 participants. Our participants had misconceptions regarding third-party applications' data sharing practices with varied mental models. Based on these findings, we created mental model-based privacy policy design that prompts users to consider a specific scenario and provides information to help them understand their misconceptions. To evaluate our designs, we then conducted an online study with 26 participants over Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Our results showed that using mental models helped users comprehend the message in the privacy policy, connect them to the design, and grabbed their attention. Finally, we offer recommendations for future research regarding the usage of mental models in designs to combat users' misconceptions with an effortless depiction of privacy policy.",

Individuals with a language disorder like aphasia, however, face this experience regularly, making it both stressful and debilitating. Large language models, such as ChatGPT, have been gaining traction in healthcare recently. They could enable digital voice assistants to help people find what they want to say during a conversation. However, research on the topic is still not mature. Our study aims at providing a first exploration of the potential use of LLMs for aphasia. Specifically, we aim to examine whether ChatGPT can aid in word retrieval in aphasia. In our study, ChatGPT is tested on real-life speech samples of people with aphasia using the AphasiaBank corpus. Additionally, we investigate whether ChatGPT can utilize politeness strategies. We found ChatGPT to be accurate in identifying the intended word 91.67% of the time as well as successful in incorporating politeness strategies.",

There was a spectrum of privacy levels in our teen participants' preferred social media platforms and preferences varied depending on their user goals such as content viewing and socializing. They recognized privacy risks they could encounter on social media, hence, actively used privacy features afforded by platforms to stay safe while meeting their goals. In addition, our teen participants designed solutions that can aid users to exercise more granular control over determining what information on their accounts is to be shared with which groups of users. Our findings highlight the need to ensure researchers and social media developers work with teens to provide teen-centric solutions for safer experiences on social media. ",

However, only some AI systems target older adult users, given their relatively low usage of digital banking. Conversely, older adults may benefit the most from AI as handling finances becomes increasingly crucial after retirement. Our paper aims to fill this gap by 1) understanding the everyday financial concerns of older adults near retirement age and 2) exploring interests and needs in AI supporting their financial concerns. To understand the perspectives of older adults regarding the support of financial needs with AI, we conducted co-design workshops with 14 older adults. Our findings revealed three key concerns: retirement planning, grown children's education and marriage expenses, and family healthcare costs. Also, participants were willing to use AI to glean the financial information they lacked and grow self-efficacy. Finally, we discuss the design opportunities of using AI to support older adults' financial decisions.",

In this poster, we introduce a design innovation – The Synthesis Lab, which aims to support students in synthesizing ideas from their online discussions in higher education classrooms. The tool offers structured work-spaces for students to decompose the synthesis process into intermediate synthesis products and features two key iterative processes of knowledge synthesis in collaborative settings: categorizing peers’ ideas into conceptual building blocks and developing a synthesis of the discussions. Future implementation and evaluation of the design will make significant contributions to both research and practice.",

AniBalloons were designed using extracted motion patterns from affective animations and mapped to six commonly communicated emotions. An evaluation study with 40 participants assessed their effectiveness in conveying intended emotions and their perceived emotional properties. The results showed that 80% of the animations effectively conveyed the intended emotions. AniBalloons covered a broad range of emotional parameters, comparable to frequently used emojis, offering potential for a wide array of affective expressions in daily communication. The findings suggest AniBalloons' promise for enhancing emotional expressiveness in text-based communication and provide early insights for future affective design.",

      "abstract": "Conversational agents (CAs) for psychotherapy pose unique challenges (e.g., reliance on domain experts to pre-script large amounts of therapeutical dialogues). To tackle these challenges, we propose a modular approach to develop such CA, called Micro-Conversation Scheme (MCS). Conversations can be algorithmically extended in MCS by combining different micro-conversations (MC), which isolate single therapeutical topic. The sequencing of MC is managed by a Connector component, connecting MC into longer conversations with context. Additionally, MCS integrates natural language generation (NLG) models as plugins for generating counseling-style utterances (e.g., reflections). Moreover, MCS adopts interactive learning to continuously improve CA based on human feedback. MCS provides a solution to the challenges of complex-to-design and difficult-to-extend conversations, and inability of CA to flexibly generate context-appropriate counseling-style utterances for psychotherapy. MCS is expected to benefit the community by promoting the collaboration between conversational designers and developers while preserve their independence during the development of CAs.",

Recent research has suggested that ambiguity can be used even to enable social connection mediated by personal data. To explore this design space more widely, we organized two design workshops with a total of 67 participants. In this paper, we present three design concepts, as outcomes of the workshops, which use ambiguity to enable social self-tracking practices. We then discuss how these concepts demonstrate the potential of ambiguity to encourage collective sense-making, directly impact the user’s social relationships, and offer multifaceted perspectives on reality.",

To explore these miscommunications, we introduce a preliminary framework based on events that occurred during 3600 minutes of observation inside a university course taught in VR. During the course, 250 people met in groups for about 20 minutes per session. We identify three types of miscommunication that routinely occurred: body crumple, sound intrusion, and embodiment violation. By mapping the affordances by which social VR fails to facilitate effective communication, we hope to provide educators, developers, and virtual ethnographers with a means for understanding and navigating the challenges of VR-based collaboration.",

      "abstract": "Autistic children’s emotional meltdown is a common challenge faced by their caregivers, including their teachers and families. Many autistic children find it extremely difficult to elaborate their problems and communicate with their caregivers, which can make it challenging for caregivers to identify the triggers of children’s meltdowns. Previous studies have shown that autistic children tend to find it easier to communicate with non-human objects such as comfort dolls or social robots. To this end, we have developed Kodi, a mobile virtual conversational agent that serves as a communication tool between autistic children and their caregivers during distressing situations. Kodi's appearance can be customized to match children’s favorite character or object. Caregivers can prompt Kodi on the child's mobile device when the child is experiencing stressful situations, such as traveling. Kodi helps children to describe their current emotions and offers soothing stories, while caregivers can tailor the story content to meet each child's unique needs. Additionally, Kodi utilizes keyword analysis to summarize conversations, identify potential triggers of emotional meltdowns (e.g., loud noises in a shopping mall, unexpected changes at school), and alert caregivers of potential problems (e.g., bullying). The data collected through Kodi can potentially be utilized to predict emotional meltdowns using machine learning techniques. The implications of the Kodi platform and future research directions are discussed in this paper.",

As HCI, learning science, and team science researchers we acknowledge the importance of leveraging AI to help students become better collaborators---a highly desired skill when they eventually enter the workforce. In this demonstration we present ``CoBi''---a multi-party AI partner that focuses on the relationship dimension of collaboration. CoBi helps students to co-negotiate classroom agreements along four dimensions: respect, equity, community, and thinking. CoBi then uses state-of-the-art speech and language technologies to look for evidence of these agreements during small group collaborative discourse and to visualize the evidence to motivate reflection. Through these feedback visualizations, students can learn more about their strengths in developing better collaborative relationships in class, identify areas for improvement, and develop critical AI literacy skills.",

Despite the challenges of working remotely, many knowledge workers still desire the flexibility of hybrid work and its personal benefits allowing for more productive individual work. However, return-to-office (RTO) mandates suggest an inclination that in-office work allows for more productive teamwork. To resolve these conflicting desires, Workspace VR was created. Unlike other social telework virtual\r\nreality (VR) applications, Workspace VR enables uncoordinated, social, collaborative, and productive individual work and teamwork via virtual avatars, workspaces, and integration with user computers. Designed for Meta Quest devices, users can feel like they are working together with others without constraints in Workspace VR.",

To support this research, we developed a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) system enabling experimenters to play the role of the conversational agent who must work with a team of three human participants to herd together a group of autonomous robots (target agents) within a virtual task environment. The experimenter can select from one of several tailored responses. The aim of this environment is to determine whether the identified responses facilitate effective team performance and to collect training data to build a conversational agent capable of engaging in team based virtual learning environments.",

However, reflection on videos is challenging for the general public due to the significant cognitive efforts, resources, and skills required.\r\nTo address this, we present DeepThinkingMap, supporting collaborative reflection and sharing for groups. By facilitating note creation and connection with links, enabling spatial organization, and link between notes and video timestamps, it affords dynamic reflection documenting and sharing experiences for groups. DeepThinkingMap may foster deeper engagement and understanding of online videos, encouraging both individuals and groups to critically reflect on the information they encounter.",

      "abstract": "Adolescent online safety research has largely focused on designing interventions for teens, with few evaluations that provide effective online safety solutions. It is challenging to evaluate such solutions without simulating an environment that mimics teens online risks. To overcome this gap, we conducted focus groups with 14 teens to co-design realistic online risk scenarios and their associated user personas, which can be implemented for an ecologically valid evaluation of interventions. We found that teens considered the characteristics of the risky user to be important and designed personas to have traits that align with the risk type, were more believable and authentic, and attracted teens through materialistic content. Teens also redesigned the risky scenarios to be subtle in information breaching, harsher in cyberbullying, and convincing in tricking the teen. Overall, this work provides an in-depth understanding of the types of bad actors and risky scenarios teens design for realistic research experimentation.",

In this exploratory study, we aspire to understand mom vloggers' motivations, practices, and challenges. Our mixed-methods inspection contained interviews with 4 mom vloggers in China and a content analysis of mom vlogs of 5 other mom vloggers. Mom vloggers' primary motivations are to make money, record daily life, and seek their individual identities and values, well meeting their financial and social needs after leaving their paid employment. When creating vlog content, mom vloggers encounter various challenges, such as a lack of video visibility, being stretched by both intensive motherhood and heavy digital work, privacy and self-presentation concerns, and so on. Based on the findings, we propose design implications toward resolving these challenges and benefiting mom vloggers' experiences.",

In this study, we propose to augment netnography with co-hashtag networks to gain a broader perspective of the online discourse among autistic people while depicting detailed contexts. We analyzed the use of hashtags in 3752 publicly available TikTok videos from 41 autistic creators and conducted an in-depth analysis of 55 of the scraped videos to explore the content and expression of autistic creators on TikTok. The results demonstrate the individuality and advocacy of autistic creators, highlighting their intersectional identities and engagement in various communities beyond the autism community. We emphasize technologies embracing diversity to prevent marginalization and empower children with autism diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Online freelancing, a type of contingent work conducted via digital labor platforms, has attracted increasing attention from scholars in the CSCW and cognate communities in recent years. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding in the research landscape regarding this phenomenon. To address this gap, we reviewed 86 papers published between 2017 and 2022 and presented the interim findings. The review followed a scoping method with a focus on three key aspects: research topics, conceptual framings, and methodological approaches. A thematic analysis reveals: 12 overarching research themes, with major focus placed on social inequality, freelancer wellbeing, and platformic management and control; 11 conceptual frameworks that primarily revolved around the worker, work, platform, and society; and qualitative methods emerged as the predominant approach in the methodological approach. Drawing from the preliminary findings, we present three implications for future research: (1) directing greater attention towards unexplored areas within the scholarship on online freelancing, (2) developing novel theoretical frameworks that are specifically tailored to the unique characteristics of platform-mediated freelance work, and (3) employing alternative research methods to holistically address the multifaceted nature of the online freelancing experience.",

While telemonitoring (TM) during prehabilitation is still in its infancy, this technology is currently being explored to build an understanding of patients' lifestyles outside the clinic. However, one prevalent design problem is fitting TM systems in clinicians’ existing workflows without disrupting or creating more work. In this study, we investigate how data from a TM system tracking patient physical activity, sleep, and stress fit into the workflow of different prehabilitation clinical specialties. We present early findings from 4 workshops conducted with an oncological physiotherapist, a specialized nurse, a surgeon, and a research doctor interested in policy making. Findings show that: (i) there is a need for different decision-support system designs per specialty, (ii) clinicians' data needs can change over the program's timeline, and (iii) clinicians prefer to share the data with patients.",
