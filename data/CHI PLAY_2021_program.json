      "abstract": "Digital games are increasingly being used to teach the processes of scientific inquiry. These games often make at least one of four key assumptions about scientific inquiry: that inquiry is a problem-solving process which is value-neutral, bounded by strict subject-matter constraints, and conducted by practitioners separable from society. However, feminist, STS, and pragmatist scholars have demonstrated the flawed nature of these assumptions. They highlight instead that: inquiry is a process of problematization that is value-laden, unbounded by subject-matter, and conducted by practitioners who socially, politically, and culturally situated. In this paper, I argue that three of the key affordances of digital games—their procedural, evaluative, and fictional qualities—can constrain their ability to teach inquiry understood as such. I examine these affordances and their relationship to the nature of scientific inquiry through a design case examining our game Solaria designed to teach students how to inquire into the development of solar cells. Specifically, I ask: To what extent can the procedural, evaluative, and fictional affordances of digital games (designed to teach students about solar cells) support the learning of scientific inquiry as a problematizing, situated, and value-laden process, unbounded by subject-matter constraints? I discuss how these affordances of games supported but ultimately limited the design of the game by trivializing real situations, predetermining criteria for progress, and distancing students from real-world risks and responsibilities, respectively. In conclusion, I briefly discuss how understanding these limitations can support the design of educational environments to complement digital games for teaching scientific inquiry.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel mobile serious game, “Space Vision”, which uses a hidden-object mechanic with fiducial marker detection to gamify a clinical test of visual acuity – a key marker of childhood eye disease. For Space Vision to become a credible clinical tool that can facilitate the screening and home-monitoring of children’s visual acuity, it must be able to sustain player engagement over the extended durations required to detect vision abnormalities. Hence, we pay particular attention to developing effective game characters – a crucial aspect of children’s game design.\r\n\r\nUsing an early prototype with 13 school children (aged 5-6 years), we investigate player experiences through a series of evaluation sessions, involving a single one-to-one observational playtest, semi-structured interview, and ideation activity with each child. Thematic analysis of our session video recordings, written observations, and ideation artefacts, found that future game iterations must: increase resonance between players and game characters by providing aesthetic and behavioural customisation, embrace more anthropomorphic styling, better imbue narratives pertaining to children’s ‘life scripts, and feature fantasy character powers as a form of self-expression. Meanwhile, greater physical device support and digital incentivisation of body posture and head position are key to improving the reliability of the visual acuity measurement.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Research on VR Exergaming is mostly conducted with participants who are not presented a choice whether or not to play the exergame and thus to perform a certain strenuous activity. Whether players would engage in such activity if it were optional and how they could be motivated to do so is mostly neglected. Therefore, we have developed a novel controller and implemented a VR exergame that utilizes Virtual Performance Augmentation (VPA) to motivate players to engage in an optional strenuous activity. The motivational impact of three different conditions (VPA vs. Points vs. No Motivator) was evaluated in a study with 47 participants. Our results suggest that using VPA can significantly increase the time the players engage in the strenuous activity enriched by VPA, while in contrast to our hypotheses, no significant differences for the players' enjoyment and perceived exertion between the conditions were found. We discuss our findings in the context of motivation, exertion, and the resulting implications for further VR exergames research.",

      "abstract": "Video games have risen as a popular medium with the potential to become a powerful tool for public climate change engagement. However, little is known about how existing digital games can fulfill this role. This study systematically compiles 150 video games that represent climate change, including serious (n = 109) and for entertainment (n = 41). The games are analyzed by adapting an existing framework (15 dimensions: achievable, challenging, concrete, credible, efficacy-enhancing, experiential learning, feedback-oriented, fun, identity-driven, levelling-up, meaningful, narrative-driven, reward-driven, simulating, social) and statistically compared. The analysis reveals that most games comply with most recommended attributes, but credibility, achievability, meaningfulness, and social features are uncommon or rare. Statistical results comparing serious games and games for entertainment associate six attributes with serious games (achievable, challenging, credible, efficacy-enhancing, experiential learning, feedback-oriented), and one (narrative-driven) with games for entertainment. The findings suggest that researchers would benefit from widening their lens to detect previously overlooked opportunities for game-based climate change engagement, communication, and education. The study also provides a systematic mapping of extant games depicting climate change for interested developers, designers and educators.",

      "abstract": "Most American girls are not meeting physical activity guidelines, placing them at risk for adverse health consequences. In response, our team developed \\textit{Frolic}, an evidence-based mobile application to address this problem through play. \\textit{Frolic} uses a socio-ecological framework and behavioral design principles to address barriers and social norms that are specific to girls. Parents are leveraged as important sources of support and motivation, with key design elements to help girls initiate play, adapt to the space, and play independently. The current paper contributes design principles for creating socio-ecological activity games for girls. In addition, we contribute the design of \\textit{Frolic} itself, a game constructed according to these guidelines, and outline future intervention studies with the app itself. Finally, we provide the perspectives of professional game designers and health experts on our work and interpretive insights for game designers and researchers who hope to work in this space.",

      "abstract": "Location-based games are highly dependent on the physical environment. One important but often overlooked factor is weather. In this paper we focus on winter weather, as this is a common weather that is often not designed for specifically. By performing a qualitative observation, interview, and questionnaire study of families during and after playing a GPS-based mobile game in a winter setting, this paper studies how winter conditions affected the gaming experience. Three main factors were observed to have a big impact on the gaming experience: snow, ice and cold. We outline ways these weather conditions were found to be both obstacles, and adding value to the game. Finally, we suggest design implications for winter weather, mainly; the need for short games due to cold, adaption of gameplay for movement in snow, to avoid interactions based on handling the phone, and to adapt maps to the effects of snow and ice. By explaining how winter conditions affect the gaming experience, location-based games can be better adapted for these weather conditions, and thereby help in making better design decisions.",

      "abstract": "Social connections shape our behaviour because of peer pressure and social contagion. This phenomenon is amplified in online networks by particularly influential individuals: influencers. Although this concept originated in social media, recent research shows how influencers can also exist in games and affect players' long-term retention. Prolonged retention caused by influencers could benefit gameful systems, especially if the system's goal is positive behavioural change. Retention is desirable because it can aid in internalizing new habits. Therefore, we investigated retention influencers' presence within a location-based persuasive gamified system (Play&Go) and their influence on other behaviours (i.e., the pursuit of a gamification goal), via social network analysis techniques. Results show how retention influencers exist in  Play&Go and how studying different influence types (which push the systems' goals) may lead to different influencer groups. Our findings emphasize the importance of social mechanics in location-based gamification and discuss the value of understanding a player community to improve game design.",

Our portfolio illustrates the learnings from our participatory engagements: it embodies ours and our participants’ ideas of how technology might support increasingly playful and socio-emotionally rich experiences around food. We contribute: (1) a list of play potentials of mealtime—i.e. people’s existing playful practices with food—that will point designers towards socio-emotionally desirable play-food experiences; (2) a portfolio of speculative design ideas that illustrate how mealtime technology could help to realize that playful potential; and (3) a discussion of our participants’ experiences with and responses to lo-fi prototypes of our ideas. Our work will provoke designers to carefully consider the impact of food-tech innovation on the quality of people’s social eating experiences and inspire them to cultivate forms of food-play that are socio-emotionally rich.",

      "abstract": "Designers of instructional software use gamification to help motivate and engage learners. Typically focusing on gamifying a single task, designers aim to provide a straightforward path through learning. In contrast, video games frequently provide optional secondary tasks using collectibles. Collectibles—like coins—are secondary, non-essential goals that encourage players to selectively take on additional challenges and engage more with a game. While research supports the idea that by increasing engagement learning can be improved, exactly how collectibles—an extremely common element in games—might be employed in gamified learning and how it might affect the play experience is underexplored. We present the results of a study comparing a gamified photo-editing training game that uses collectibles to one without collectibles. Our results show that learners choose to engage more when collectibles are present, and that this has a positive effect on software skills applied to a representative out-of-game challenge. Our findings provide a nuanced view of the tradeoffs in motivation and experience when collectibles are used.",

      "abstract": "Currently, there is no formal taxonomy for the activities that users engage in when interacting with and making meaning from spatio-temporal game data visualizations. As data visualization, especially spatio-temporal visualization, becomes more popular for game data analytics, it becomes increasingly crucial that we develop a formal understanding of how users, especially players, interact with and extract meaning from game data using these systems. However, existing taxonomies developed for InfoVis are not directly applicable due to domain differences and a lack of consensus within the literature. This paper presents the beginnings of a taxonomy for user interaction with spatio-temporal data specific to the domain of games, developed from the results of a qualitative user study (n=7) in which experienced players were tasked with using a spatio-temporal visualization system to explore and understand telemetry data from \\textit{Defense of the Ancients 2} (DotA 2). The taxonomy includes seven activities organized into three categories: Data Interaction, Sense Making, and Validation. We discuss the implications of these activities on design and future research.",

      "abstract": "While evidence supports that some commercial off-the-shelf video games may promote mental wellbeing, it is an extensive time investment to experimentally identify games that benefit players. The time delay between commercial games research and commercial game development can render such research out-of-date. In this work, we explore player-written game reviews as a way to expeditiously identifying games with potential benefits for mental wellbeing. Through a content analysis of review data, we found that players publicly disclose experiences consistent with self-care. Our analysis generated categories related to coping and recovery, emotional regulation, social connectedness, and obsessive play. Through this process, we identified several games as strong candidates for further research. Our work contributes to an emerging research agenda of commercial video games as therapy (VGTx), by providing a technique for rapidly identifying games with therapeutic potential. Further, we demonstrate that Steam user reviews are a valuable source of affective player experience data—a contribution with broad implications for player experience research.",

      "abstract": "In Motive Disposition Theory, the affiliation motive describes our need to form mutually satisfying bonds, whereas the power motive is the wish to influence others. To understand how these social motives shape play experience, we explore their relationship to Self-Determination Theory and Flow Theory in League of Legends. We find that: higher intimacy motivation is associated with greater relatedness satisfaction, autonomy satisfaction, enjoyment, and the flow dimension of absorption; higher prosocial motivation with more effort invested and the flow dimension fluency of performance; and higher dominance motivation with lower relatedness satisfaction but higher competence satisfaction and increased flow in both dimensions. We demonstrate that in addition to being driven to satisfy universal needs, players also possess individualized needs that explain our underlying motives and ultimately shape our gaming preferences and experiences. Our results suggest that people do not merely gravitate towards need-supportive situations, but actively seek, change, and create situations based on their individualized motives.",

      "abstract": "Rejection consists of a range of behaviors from ignoring another to explicitly excluding someone from an encounter. Currently available experimental tasks have shown that rejection has strong emotional, behavioral, and physical effects, but the tasks have some limitations. We argue that video games can address these limitations and have developed a new experimental task (ScrollQuest) to show the potential of video games as rejection research tools. The primary goal of the present study was to explore the effects of ScrollQuest. We analyzed data from 116 young adults who played both ScrollQuest and the rejection experimental task Cyberball. Playing ScrollQuest had more negative effects on mood, more negative interpretation effects were observed after playing ScrollQuest, and ScrollQuest was perceived as more enjoyable, compared to Cyberball. Our findings suggest that ScrollQuest might be an effective new experimental task to study rejection in a digital environment, but more work is needed to improve ScrollQuest.",

      "abstract": "Videogames receive increasing acclaim as a medium capable of artistic expression, emotional resonance, and even transformative potential. Yet while discussions concerning the status of games as art have a long history in games research, little is known about the player experience (PX) of games as art, their emotional characteristics, and what impact they may have on players. Drawing from Empirical Aesthetics, we surveyed 174 people about whether they had an art experience with videogames and what emotions they experienced. Our findings showcase the prominence of epistemic emotions for videogame art experiences, beyond the negative and mixed emotional responses previously examined, as well as the range of personal impacts such experiences may have. These findings are consistent with art experience phenomena characteristic of other art forms. Moreover, we discuss how our study relates to prior research on emotions and reflection in PX, the importance of games' representational qualities in art experiences, and identify lines of further inquiry.

      "abstract": "Cloud gaming services and remote play offer a wide range of advantages but can inherent a considerable delay between input and action also known as latency. \r\nPrevious work indicates that deep learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks (ANN) are able to compensate for latency. \r\nAs high latency in video games significantly reduces player performance and game experience,\r\n this work investigates if latency can be compensated using ANNs within a live first-person action game. \r\n We developed a 3D video game and coupled it with the prediction of an ANN. We trained our network on data of 24 participants who played the game in a first study.\r\n  We evaluated our system in a second user study with 96 participants. To simulate latency in cloud game streaming services, we added 180 ms latency to the game by buffering user inputs.\r\n   In the study we predicted latency values of 60 ms, 120 ms and 180 ms. Our results show that players achieve significantly higher scores, substantially more hits per shot and associate the game significantly stronger with a positive affect when supported by our ANN. This work illustrates that high latency systems, such as game streaming services, benefit from utilizing a predictive system. ",

      "abstract": "Personalization of gamification is an alternative to overcome the shortcomings of the one-size-fits-all approach, but the few empirical studies analyzing its effects do not provide conclusive results. While many user and contextual information affect gamified experiences, prior personalized gamification research focused on a single user characteristic/dimension. Therefore, we hypothesize if a multidimensional approach for personalized gamification, considering multiple (user and contextual) information, can improve user motivation when compared to the traditional implementation of gamification. In this paper, we test that hypothesis through a mixed-methods sequential explanatory study. First, 26 participants completed two assessments using one of the two gamification designs and self-reported their motivations through the Situational Motivation Scale. Then, we conducted semi-structured interviews to understand learners' subjective experiences during these assessments. As result, the students using the personalized design were more motivated than those using the one-size-fits-all approach regarding intrinsic motivation and identified regulation. Furthermore, we found the personalized design featured game elements suitable to users' preferences, being perceived as motivating and need-supporting. Thus, informing i) practitioners on the use of a strategy for personalizing gamified educational systems that is likely to improve students' motivations, compared to OSFA gamification, and ii) researchers on the potential of multidimensional personalization to improve single-dimension strategies.

      "abstract": "Animal Crossing is an online multiplayer game that supports social communication and collaboration. Its recent version, New Horizons, is immensely popular having sold over 32 million copies worldwide, with many players attracted to the opportunities it provides to remotely socialize during the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand players’ increased positive emotions and social interactions, we surveyed 119 of them between May and December 2020 and conducted remote interviews with 25 respondents. We identified the social dynamics among players and with non-player characters (NPCs), and analyzed how positive social interactions were facilitated under player-generated narratives and game-determined narratives. Based on our empirical analyses, we have extended our understanding of how to create positive, safe, and friendly interactions: (1) the design of mood-improving game worlds with flexible game tasks, (2) implementation of game-determined activities with social implications, (3) provision of player rewards to reinforce their social interactions, and (4) creation of opportunities to integrate NPCs’ game-determined narratives into player-generated narratives.",

We approach this challenge through the lens of serious games. Serious games are designed to instruct and inform within the confines of their magic circle. We built a multiplayer serious game, Point of Contact (PoC), to investigate effects of a serious game on perception and behavior. We conducted a study with 23 participants to gauge perceptions of COVID-19 preventive measures and quantify the change after playing PoC. The results show a significant positive change to participants’ perceptions towards COVID-19 preventive measures, shifting perceptions towards following guidelines more strictly due to a greater awareness of how the virus spreads. We discuss these implications and the value of a serious game like PoC towards pandemic risk modelling at a microcosm level.\r\n",

Yet, how technology co-use, such as co-playing digital games, affords and impacts parent-child relationships is still understudied. Using 20 in-depth interviews of adults who had co-played modern digital games with their parents and/or children, in this paper we investigate parent-child relationships mediated by co-playing modern digital games. We update prior HCI and CHI PLAY research on game-mediated parent-child relationships by suggesting a \"democratized\" family life and a fading digital divide for families with favorable digital game co-play experiences. We also contribute to HCI and CHI PLAY by providing new perspectives of technology co-use in the context of gaming, such as an important relational tool that parents can use to promote conversations with their child(ren). These insights can further inform the design of future play to better support parent-child interactions during digital game co-play.",

      "abstract": "Gamification has been recently growing in popularity among researchers investigating Information and Communication Technologies. Scholars have been trying to take advantage of this approach in the field of natural language processing (NLP), developing Games With A Purpose (GWAPs) for corpus annotation that have obtained encouraging results both in annotation quality and overall cost. However, GWAPs implement gamification in different ways and to different degrees. We propose a new framework to investigate the mechanics employed in the gamification process and their magnitude in terms of complexity. This framework is based on an analysis of some of the most important contributions in the field of NLP-related gamified applications and GWAP theory. Its primary purpose is to provide a first step towards classifying mechanics that mimic mainstream video games and may require skills that are not relevant to the annotation task, defined as orthogonal mechanics. In order to test our framework, we develop and evaluate Spacewords, a linguistic space game for synonymy annotation.",

      "abstract": "Replay of interactive stories is an essential characteristic of the medium, enabling players to both see whether their choices impact the narrative, and work towards an understanding of the story and underlying system. Despite the centrality of replay to the form, little work has been done to investigate what motivates people to replay interactive stories, or when and why they stop replaying. In this paper, we report on the results of an exploratory qualitative observational study of 12 participants (aged 22 to 28) replaying the visual novel The Shadows that Run Alongside Our Car, a short work that presents a post-apocalyptic survival story from the perspective of two different playable characters and involves four dialogue choices leading to one of three possible endings. Unlike previous models of rereading, our observations suggest that players’ reasons for deciding whether or not to replay change fluidly as their sense of closure changes, and players are deciding based not just on whether they have reached closure, but also on their estimate of the likelihood of seeing something new or moving closer to closure versus the effort required to replay. This suggests a need to rethink earlier, more simplistic models of rereading in interactive stories.",

      "abstract": "Digital games are designed to be controlled using hardware devices such as gamepads, keyboards, and cameras. Some device inputs may be inaccessible to players with motor impairments, rendering them unable to play. Games and devices can be adapted to enable play, but for some players these adaptations may not go far enough. Games may require inputs that some players cannot provide with any device. To address this problem, we introduce partial automation, an accessibility technique that delegates control of inaccessible game inputs to an AI partner. Partial automation complements and builds on other approaches to improving games' accessibility, including universal design, player balancing, and interface adaptation. We have demonstrated partial automation in two games for the rehabilitation of spinal cord injury. Six study participants with vastly different motor abilities were able to play both games. Participants liked the increased personalization that partial automation affords, although some participants were confused by aspects of the AI's behaviour.",

We investigated the use of biophilia, an affective response to nature grounded in the psychology literature, as indirect physiological input for biofeedback games. We designed and developed a non-violent exploration game, and conducted an empirical study that examined affective and physiological responses to gameplay in virtual nature and urban settings. Our results did not identify a difference in stress levels experienced by players between these two settings, but point to improved attention when playing in nature settings. We discuss implications of these findings, and discuss both difficulties in and potential future strategies for applying biophilia to the design of biofeedback games.",

We are interested in designing game systems where players shape and contribute their own narratives as game content. Study one designed and playtested three Virtual Tabletop Role-Playing Game (VTTRPG) prototypes where we found that structured, graphical representations of players’ traces support co-design and narrative analysis. We also identified four categories of traces: environment, build, memory and object. We introduce Play Traces, a novel analysis method for representing and co-designing with players and their narratives. A structured observation including Play Traces studied 17 players over 16 four-hour sessions in the third VTTRPG prototype. We found that players successfully (and enjoyably) co-designed novel narratives. We identified three themes for how traces can affect and support players in shaping new interactive narratives. We present four design implications describing how player-created narratives in MMORPGs should first Reveal & Pull Attention from other players, Invite & Push further exploration, Guide & Assist toward endings, and optionally Show & Hide traces. Finally, we discuss how treating players as co-designers offers a promising approach for developing the next generation of MMORPGs.",

      "abstract": "The concept of gamified interactive models and its novel extensions, such as playification, has been widely approached in order to engage users in many fields. In fields such as HCI and AI, however, these approaches were not yet employed for supporting users to create different forms of artworks, like a musical corpus. While allowing novel forms of interactivity with partially-autonomous systems, these techniques could also foster the emergence of artworks not limited to experts. Hence, in this paper we introduce the concept of meta-interactivity for compositional interfaces, which extends an individual's capabilities by the translation of an effort into a proficiency. We present how this approach can be effective through a novel system that enables non-experts to compose coherent musical pieces through the use of imagetic elements in a virtual environment. We conduct experiments with a population of musical experts and non-experts, showing that non-experts were able to learn and create high-quality musical productions through our interactive approach.",

      "abstract": "The potential space of game designs is astronomically large. This paper shows how game design theories can be translated into a simple, tangible card deck that can assist in the exploration of new game designs within a broader “design space.” By translating elements of game design theory into a physical card deck, we enable users to randomly sample a design space in order to synthesize new game design variations for a new play platform (“Lumies”). In a series of iterative design and testing rounds with various user groups, the deck has been optimized to merge relevant game theory elements into a concise card deck with limited categories and clear descriptions. In a small, controlled experiment involving groups of design students, we compare the effects of brainstorming with the card deck or the “Directed Brainstorming” method. We show that the deck does not increase ideation speed but is preferred by participants. We further show that our target audience, children, were able to use the card deck to develop dozens of new game ideas. We conclude that design space cards are a promising way to help adults and children to generate new game ideas by making it easier to explore the game design space.",

      "abstract": "Mainstream location-based games (LBGs) highlight three foundations—exercise, exploration, and social interaction—which were hugely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This genre has already had access issues depending on the player’s region, identity, ability, and technology, which the pandemic also amplified. Thus, the pandemic provided a unique opportunity to re-imagine the design of LBGs to preserve player benefits while challenging these foundations. We conducted a two-week diary study with 11 LBG players coping with difficult life circumstances, followed by remote co-design sessions. Participants continued to play primarily to maintain community connection while adjusting the mode of socialization, finding meaning through virtual exploration, and support mental health and personal growth. Participants discussed ways to enhance the experience by expanding the range of physical activities during social distancing, reimagining proximity-based social interactions, and exploring via social construction of places while expanding beyond how the three foundations are currently supported in LBGs.",

Users’ perceived control increased significantly compared to the 50% baseline. In turn, frustration levels decreased. Fabricated input worked equally well in a game story context that provided an emotional stake in the protagonist’s success and a simpler task lacking such incentives. People’s number of input attempts during the tasks determined perceived control more than our controlled ratios of positive to negative task outcomes. Delays between users’ input attempts and subsequent fabricated inputs further moderated their perceived control.",

      "abstract": "Although multiple studies have shown the efficacy of Serious Games (SGs) in improving students’ performance and learning experience, the wide use of SGs is yet to be realised. One of the challenges towards the adoption of SGs can be attributed to the complex and costly development process. In this paper, we present ARQS (Authentic Role-playing-game Quest System) tool, an educator-oriented authoring tool we developed for supporting the implementation of a serious role-playing-game (RPG). The authoring tool consists of features that simplify the creation of important RPG components e.g. avatars, virtual world. Furthermore, the authoring process employs block-based programming to configure aspects of RPG such as creating quests. The concept is adopted in order to provide a platform where educators without programming knowledge are able to use. A formative evaluation was conducted with ten educators from secondary and university levels, using a low-fidelity prototype. Outcomes from the evaluation showed promising results, attesting the potential of ARQS as an educational tool for the creation of interactive learning instructions in the form of real-world scenarios embedded within a role-playing-game.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to automated playtesting for the prediction of human player behavior and experience. We have previously demonstrated that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) game-playing agents can predict both game difficulty and player engagement, operationalized as average pass and churn rates. We improve this approach by enhancing DRL with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We also motivate an enhanced selection strategy for predictor features, based on the observation that an AI agent's best-case performance can yield stronger correlations with human data than the agent's average performance. Both additions consistently improve the prediction accuracy, and the DRL-enhanced MCTS outperforms both DRL and vanilla MCTS in the hardest levels. We conclude that player modelling via automated playtesting can benefit from combining DRL and MCTS. Moreover, it can be worthwhile to investigate a subset of repeated best AI agent runs, if AI gameplay does not yield good predictions on average.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Visual Novel (VN) is a widely recognizable genre of narrative-focused games that has grown in popularity over the past decade. Surprisingly, despite being so widely recognizable, there is not a singular definition to help guide the design and analysis of such games---with academic definitions and implementations ranging from \"interactive textbooks\" to \"adventure games with multi-ending stories\". In this paper, we present a unified definition of VNs drawn from an analysis of 30 prior academic definitions. We also examined 54 existing VNs to further refine our definition and employ a deeper analysis of the interactivity within VNs. We highlight key features of VNs that arise in our definition, and discuss resulting implications for the design of VNs. This work is relevant for narrative game designers and researchers, affording a more unified structure and clearer guidelines to identify, analyze, and design future VN games.",

      "abstract": "This article studies the effects and implications of sybils (secondary accounts created by a person in an online platform) through the game World of Tanks from interdisciplinary, mixed-methods perspectives. Considering sybils allows us to access a ``person based'' network, instead of an “account based” network, revealing formerly undetected patterns. We move on to behavioral differences between the “parent” (the initial account) and “child” (those created afterwards) accounts in a sybil relationship. We explore the behavioral patterns of sybils using network, chat, and gameplay data. We find that sybils represent players experimenting with new roles or features without damaging their play record. We find that there are significant behavioral differences between different sybil accounts, and we leverage them to build a machine learning classifier to differentiate sybils. This classifier is able to identify sybil accounts with over 95\\% accuracy for sybil/non-sybil, 61\\% for parent/child. This study demonstrates the underexplored but rich potential for sybils to improve research and industry practitioners’ understandings of user practices and experiences.",

      "abstract": "Games have the potential to not only entertain and immerse people, but can be used as vehicles for meaning-making. Given these qualities, games are approached as inspiration for caring technologies, especially for mental health. This transformative process often prioritises learning from games as systems, but not necessarily from the experiences of people with mental distress who play games for self-care. In this paper, we report on a participatory workshop series that sets out to further illuminate the connection between games, self-care and mental health from a humanistic, person-centred perspective. Over four workshops, we engaged 16 people with experiences of mental distress in speculative making activities and discussions of how self-care technology inspired by games could be re-envisioned. By thematically analysing our discussions and collective sense-making, we showcase how participants actively \"re-frame\" games for self-care. Finally, we sketch out how game developers and makers of gameful self-care technologies could build on our findings.",

      "abstract": "The concept of flow is used extensively in HCI, video games, and many other fields, but its prevalent definition is conceptually vague and alternative interpretations have contributed to ambiguity in the literature. To address this, we use cognitive science theory to expose inconsistencies in flow's prevalent definition, and introduce fuse, a concept related to flow but consistent with cognitive science, and defined as the ``fusion of activity-related sensory stimuli and awareness''. Based on this definition, we develop a preliminary model that hypothesizes fuse's underlying cognitive processes. To illustrate the model's practical value, we derive a set of design heuristics that we exemplify in the context of video games. Together, the fuse definition, model and design heuristics form our theoretical framework, and are a product of rethinking flow from a cognitive perspective with the purpose of improving conceptual clarity and theoretical robustness in the literature.",

      "abstract": "Human-Computer Interaction researchers have explored how online communities can be leveraged for peer support, but general disinterest and a lack of engagement have emerged as substantial barriers to their use in practice. To address this gap, we designed Merlynne, a serious game that seeks to motivate individuals to support peers through Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Our game explored use of the Proteus Effect —  a phenomenon where players adopt characteristics of their in-game avatar — to motivate peer support through stereotyped 'helpful' and 'unhelpful' avatars. We then conducted a mixed-methods, exploratory study to investigate its design. We found that our game successfully motivated players to offer peer support, despite the substantial emotional labour required by CBT. However, we were not able to replicate the Proteus Effect, and did not find differences in that support based on a player's avatar. In reflecting on our findings, we discuss design challenges and considerations for the use of serious games to motivate participation in mental health support, including: fatigue, a player's need for self-expression and to relate to those they are supporting, and ludonarrative dissonance.",

We elicited 23 skill chains from players and developers and augmented our reflexive thematic analysis with 11 semi-structured interviews in order to determine how players and developers conceptualize skill trees and whether free recall can be used as an alternative to more resource-intensive cognitive task analyses. We provide three main contributions: (1) a comparison of skill chain conceptualizations between players and developers and across prior literature; (2) insights to the process of free recall in eliciting CSG skill chains; and (3) a preliminary toolkit of CSG skill-based design recommendations based on our findings. We conclude CSG developers should: give the big picture up front; embrace social learning and paratext use; reinforce the intended structure of knowledge; situate learning within applicable, meaningful contexts; design for discovery and self-reflection; and encourage practice and learning beyond the tutorial.  Free recall was ineffective for determining a traditional skill chain but was able to elicit the core gameplay loops, tutorial overviews, and some expert insights.",

      "abstract": "Escape rooms exist in various forms, including real-life facilities, board games, and digital implementations. The underlying idea is always the same: players have to solve many diverse puzzles to (virtually) escape from a locked room. Within the last decade, we witnessed a rapidly increasing popularity of such games, which also amplified the amount of related research. However, the respective academic landscape is mostly fragmented in its current state, lacking a common model and vocabulary that would withstand these games' variety. This manuscript aims to establish such a foundation for the analysis and construction of escape rooms. In a first step, we derive a high-level design framework from prior literature. Then, as our main contribution, we establish an atomic puzzle taxonomy that closes the gap between the analog and digital domains. The taxonomy is developed in multiple steps: we compose a basic structure based on previous literature and systematically refine it by analyzing 39 analog and digital escape room games, including recent virtual reality representatives. The final taxonomy consists of mental, physical, and emotional challenges, thereby providing a robust and approachable basis for future works across all application domains that deal with escape rooms or puzzles in general.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive-physical exercises can reduce the progression of dementia. However, traditional methods often induce problems (e.g., lack of motivation), whereas the success of recent virtual reality (VR) exergames such as Beat Saber may provide a playful, motivational, and immersive alternative. Yet, until now, it remains unclear which game mechanics, concepts, and designs work best for people with dementia, and how to implement exergames for and with this user group. In this paper, we adapted a human-centered design approach to address the specifics of developing VR exergames for people with dementia. This includes semi-structured interviews with stakeholders and contextual inquiries to better analyze the user requirements. Based on our analysis, we present Memory Journalist VR - a novel VR exergame specifically designed for people with dementia in a participatory design process. We report the qualitative evaluation based on the feedback gathered in five focus group sessions. Finally, we discuss the lessons learned, which provide important insights for the design of future VR exergames for people with dementia: (i) creating social gaming activities with a focus on shared aspects, (ii) support of an inverse game flow channel addressing decline and variance in cognitive-physical abilities, and (iii) ensuring a safe VR exergame experience.",

      "abstract": "AI-enabled decision support systems have repeatedly failed in real world applications despite the underlying model operating as designed. Often this was because the system was used in an unexpected manner. Our goal is to enable better prediction of how systems will be used prior to their implementation as well as to improve existing designs, by taking human behavior into account.  There are several challenges to collecting such data. Not having access to an existing prediction engine requires the simulation of such a system’s behavior. This simulation must include not just the behavior of the underlying model but also the context in which the decision will be made in the real world. Additionally, collecting statistically valid samples requires that test subjects make repeated choices under slightly varied conditions. Unfortunately, in such repetitious conditions fatigue can quickly set in. Games provide us the ability to address both of these challenges by providing both systems context and narrative context. Systems context can be used to convey some or all of the information the player needs to make a decision in the game environment itself, which can help avoid the onset of fatigue. Narrative context can provide a broader environment within which the simulated system operates, adding a sense of progress, showing the effect of decisions, adding perceived social norms, and setting incentives and stakes. This broader environment can further prevent player fatigue while replicating many of the external factors that might affect choices in the real world.\r\nIn this paper we describe the design of the Human-AI Decision Evaluation System (HADES), a test harness capable of interfacing with a game environment, simulating the behavior of an AI-enabled decision support system, and collecting the results of human decision making based upon such a system’s predictions. Additionally, we present an analysis of data collected by HADES while interfaced with a visual novel game focused on software cyber-risk assessment.",

      "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has disrupted the gaming market and is rapidly becoming ubiquitous. Yet differences between VR and traditional mediums, such as controllers that are visible in the virtual world, enable entirely new approaches to instruction. In this paper, we present four studies, each using a different VR game. Within each study, we compared three different modalities of tutorials: Text (text-only), Text+Diagram (text with controller diagrams), and Text+Spatial (text with controller tooltips appearing on top of the player’s virtual controllers). Data from our studies show that the importance of tutorial modality depends greatly on game type. In a third-person shooter, Text+Spatial led to significantly higher controls learnability than Text and Text+Diagram, and also led to significantly higher performance, player experience, and intrinsic motivation than Text. In a puzzle game, Text+Spatial led to significantly higher controls learnability and performance than Text. Additionally, Text+Diagram led to significantly higher controls learnability than Text. However, in a wave shooter and a rhythm game, differences between conditions were negligible on all measures. Our studies show that game type is an important factor to consider when designing tutorial modality.",

      "abstract": "Avatar identification is one of the most promising research areas in games user research. Greater identification with one's avatar has been associated with improved outcomes in the domains of health, entertainment, and education. However, existing studies have focused almost exclusively on the visual appearance of avatars. Yet audio is known to influence immersion/presence, performance, and physiological responses. We perform one of the first studies to date on avatar self-similar audio. We conducted a 2 x 3 (similar/dissimilar x modulation upwards/downwards/none) study in a Java programming game. We find that voice similarity leads to a significant increase in performance, time spent, similarity identification, competence, relatedness, and immersion. Similarity identification acts as a significant mediator variable between voice similarity and all measured outcomes. Our study demonstrates the importance of avatar audio and has implications for avatar design more generally across digital applications.",

      "abstract": "Is it possible to detect toxicity in games just by observing in-game behavior? If so, what are the behavioral factors that will help machine learning to discover the unknown relationship between gameplay and toxic behavior? In this initial study, we examine whether it is possible to predict toxicity in the MOBA game For Honor by observing in-game behavior for players that have been labeled as toxic (i.e. players that have been\r\nsanctioned by Ubisoft community managers). We test our hypothesis of detecting toxicity through gameplay with a dataset of almost 1, 800 sanctioned players, and comparing these sanctioned players with unsanctioned players. Sanctioned players are defined by their toxic action type (offensive behavior vs. unfair advantage) and degree of severity (warned vs. banned). Our findings, based on supervised learning with random forests, suggest that it is not only possible to behaviorally distinguish sanctioned from unsanctioned players based on selected features of gameplay; it is also possible to predict both the sanction severity (warned vs. banned) and the sanction type (offensive behavior vs. unfair advantage). In particular, all random forest models predict toxicity, its severity, and type, with an accuracy of at least 82%, on average, on unseen players. This research shows that observing in-game behavior can support the work of community managers in moderating and possibly containing the burden of toxic behavior.",

      "abstract": "  The User Engagement Scale (UES) is a self-reported attitude scale broadly used in user research to measure their engagement with interactive systems, such as digital games and applications. The present work presents a translation of UES to the Portuguese language and its cultural adaptation to the Brazilian context. We followed five steps for the cross-cultural adaptation process: Translation, Synthesis, Back translation, Expert committee review, and Pretesting. Seeking to assure that the translated version is equivalent to the original in terms of metrics and semantics, we run tests on two data sets collected from 432 users' past experiences. As expected, T-tests for independent samples demonstrated that UES-Br provides significantly higher engagement experiences than scores for non-engaging experiences. An exploratory factor analysis indicated that most items were strongly correlated to the main factor (Engagement), showing a single underlying factor for all items. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis suggests that the original four-factor model provided an adequate fit to the data collected with UES-Br. The translation also demonstrated evidence of validity and reliability. This paper contributes to the global player- and human-computer interaction knowledge by enabling the Portuguese-speaking community to use a validated tool already established for native English speakers.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Players can get stuck in video games, which impedes their process to their goal and results in unfavorable outcomes like negative emotions, impediments of flow, and obstacles for learning. Currently, it is not easily possible to assess if a player is stuck, as no widely accepted definition of \"being stuck\" in games exists. We conducted 13 expert interviews and a systematic literature review with 104 relevant papers selected from 4022 candidates. We present a definition of \"being stuck\" that conceptualizes the state as a continuum and contextualize it within related concepts. Our stuck continuum can be applied to regulate the player's stuck level. We propose a taxonomy of measures that are useful for the detection of the level of stuckness and discuss the effectiveness of countermeasures. Our stuck concept is crucial for game developers creating an optimal player experience in games.",

      "abstract": "Video games frequently invoke high-pressure circumstances in which player performance is crucial. These high-pressure circumstances are incubators for ‘choking’ and ‘clutching’—phenomena that broadly address critical failures and successes in performance, respectively. The eruption of esports into the mainstream has vitalized the need to understand performance in video games, and particularly in competitive games spaces. In this work, we explore the potential mechanisms behind choking and clutching and how they are related to player traits and tendencies. We report the results of multiple regression analyses, finding that the propensity to choke is positively correlated with Reinvestment, Obsessive Passion, and Public Self-Consciousness, as well as Approach and Avoidance coping styles. Likewise, we find that the propensity to clutch is negatively correlated with Social Anxiety, and positively with Private Self-Consciousness and player experience with competitive gaming. We propose that these findings can be utilized to scaffold and support performance in high-pressure gaming spaces, such as esports. This work represents an initial step in the empirical exploration of choking and clutching in competitive video game contexts.",

      "abstract": "Video games are often designed around puzzles and problem-solving, leading to challenging yet engaging experiences for players. However, it is hard to measure or compare the challenge level of puzzles in video games. This can make designing appropriately challenging puzzles problematic. This study collates previous work to present refined definitions for challenge and difficulty within the context of video games. We present the Puzzle Challenge Analysis tool which can be used to determine the best metrics for analysing the challenge level of puzzles within video games. Previous research has focused on measuring the difficulty of simple action video games, such as Pac-Man, which can be easily modified for research purposes. Existing methods to measure challenge or difficulty include measuring player brain activity, examining game features and player scores. However, some of these approaches cannot be applied to puzzles or puzzle games. For example, approaches relying on game scores will not work for puzzle games with no scoring system, where puzzles are either solved or not. This paper describes the design and development of the Puzzle Challenge Analysis tool using two case studies of commercial video games The Witness and Untitled Goose Game. The tool is also tested for generalisability on a third commercial puzzle video game, Baba Is You. This proposed tool can help game designers and researchers to objectively analyse and compare puzzle challenge and produce more in-depth insights into the player experience. This has implications for designing challenging and engaging games for a range of player abilities.",

      "abstract": "Video games that require players to utilize a target or second language to complete tasks have emerged as alternative pedagogical tools for Second Language Acquisition (SLA). With the exception of vocabulary acquisition, much of the prior research in game-based SLA fails to gauge students’ literacy skills, specifically their morphological awareness or understanding of the smallest meaningful linguistic units (e.g., prefixes, suffixes, and roots). Given this shortcoming, we utilize a two-player online game to facilitate social interactions between Native English Speakers (NES) and English as a Second Language (ESL) students as a mechanism to generate ESL students' written output in the targeted language and draw attention to their morphological awareness. Analysis of chat logs demonstrates the game’s potential to enhance ESL students’ morphological awareness and other important L2 literacy skills such as word reading accuracy. Both NES and ESL students' reflections of their gameplay experiences suggest game design modifications that promote ESL students' willingness to communicate with NES while developing their morphological awareness and practicing their L2 communication and literacy skills.",

      "abstract": "Games and play research at CHI employs psychological theory to investigate the ways that varied qualities of people, videogames, and play contexts contribute to nuances in player experience (PX). Play is often characterised as self-endorsed and freely chosen behaviour, and self-determination theory (SDT) proposes that this autonomous quality contributes to wellbeing restoration. However, prior research has produced only inconsistent support for this claim.\r\n\r\nIn this study, 148 participants experienced an autonomy-satisfying or -frustrating puzzle before playing Spore, a videogame likely to satisfy autonomy. Need-frustrated participants showed comparatively greater improvement in autonomy, vitality, and intrinsic motivation when playing Spore, and in-game autonomy satisfaction was shown to index post-play wellbeing outcomes. However, further results were mixed, and only competence frustration was found to predict ill-being outcomes. These findings are contextualised by post-study interviews that investigate the ways that autonomy, wellbeing, and motivation emerge in and through play in daily life.",

      "abstract": "Measuring theoretical concepts, so-called constructs, is a central challenge of Player Experience research. Building on recent work in HCI and psychology, we conducted a systematic literature review to study the transparency of measurement reporting. We accessed the ACM Digital Library to analyze all 48 full papers published at CHI PLAY 2020, of those, 24 papers used self-report measurements and were included in the full review. We assessed specifically, whether researchers reported What, How and Why they measured. We found that researchers matched their measures to the construct under study and that administrative details, such as number of points on a Likert-type scale, were frequently reported. However, definitions of the constructs to be measured and justifications for selecting a particular scale were sparse. Lack of transparency in these areas threaten the validity of singular studies, but further compromise the building of theories and accumulation of research knowledge in meta-analytic work. This work is limited to only assessing the current transparency of measurement reporting at CHI PLAY 2020, however we argue this constitutes a fair foundation to assess potential pitfalls. To address these pitfalls, we propose a prescriptive model of a measurement selection process, which aids researchers to systematically define their constructs, specify operationalizations, and justify why these measures were chosen. Future research employing this model should contribute to more transparency in measurement reporting. The research was funded through internal resources.

      "abstract": "The area of biofeedback interaction has grown over recent years, thanks to the release of more affordable and reliable sensor technology, and the accessibility offered by modern game development tools. This article presents a systematic literature review focusing on how different biofeedback interaction methods have been used for entertainment purposes in video games, between 2008 and 2020. It divides previous contributions in terms of a proposed interaction classification criteria and five different biofeedback methods (with a sixth category combining them): electroencephalography, electrocardiography, eye tracking, electrodermal activity, electromyography, and multi-modal interaction. The review describes the properties, sensor technologies, and the type of data gathered for every included biofeedback method, and presents their respective interaction techniques. It summarizes a set of opportunities and challenges for each included method, based on the results from previous work, and discusses these findings. It also analyzes how these interaction techniques are distributed between different common game genres. The review is beneficial for people interested in biofeedback methods and their potential use for novel interaction techniques in future video games.",

The game lets users experience the life of six tropical urban birds across three seasons of a year. By performing different activities of birds, players learn about the challenges that an ever-changing urban environment creates for bird species. We reflect on our design process and describe the key design decisions that led to the development of our game. We also present insights of a playtesting session that was conducted with 11 participants to evaluate the design aspects of the game. Based on the study insights we present three implications on collaboration over competition, local game movement and longitudinal first-person perspective. Through this work, we aim to inspire more playful explorations on human-wildlife cohabitation.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety is a prevalent problem that affects many people with varying severity; digital exposure therapy—which involves controlled exposure to simulations of feared social situations alongside cognitive restructuring—can help treat patients with anxieties. However, the need to personalize exposure scenarios and simulate audiences are barriers to treating social anxieties through digital exposure. In this paper, we propose game streaming as an exposure therapy paradigm for social anxiety, supporting it with data from two studies. We first propose a framework describing requirements for exposure therapy and how game streaming can fulfill them. We select demand and performance visibility from these characteristics to showcase how to manipulate them for experiences of gradual exposure. With Study 1, we provide evidence for these characteristics and support for the framework by showing that a game’s demand affected expected fear of streaming games. In Study 2, we show that the prospect of streaming led to elevated fear, a necessary property for effective exposure therapy. Further, we show that the effect of streaming on expected fear was similar for participants who can be considered socially anxious. These findings provide evidence for the essential effect of exposure therapy, which serves as a first step towards the validation of streaming as a social anxiety treatment. Our paper provides an initial, important step towards a novel, broadly applicable, and widely accessible digital approach for the treatment of social anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Gaze interaction has been growing fast as a compelling tool for control and immersion for gameplay. Here, we present a conceptual framework focusing on the aesthetic player experience and the potential interpretation (meaning) players could give to playing with gaze interaction capabilities. The framework is illustrated by a survey of state of the art research-based and commercial games. We complement existing frameworks by reflecting on gaze interaction in games as the attention relationship between the player (the subject) and the game (the object) with four dimensions: Identity; Mapping; Attention; and Direction. The framework serves as a design and inquiry toolbox to analyse and communicate gaze mechanics in games, reflect on the complexity of gaze interaction, and formulate new research questions. We visualise the resulting design space, highlighting future opportunities for gaze interaction design and HCI gaze research through the framework's lens. We deem, this novel approach advocates for the design of gaze-based interactions revealing the richness of gaze input in future meaningful game experiences.",

      "abstract": "Despite increasing interest in the use of digital tools in boardgames for both commercial and research purposes, little research has to date explored how and why these tools are used. We interviewed 18 professionals working in the boardgame industry to explore the combination of digital tools and tabletop play, which affords new experiences and opportunities for both players and designers. We generated five key themes from the interview data. Participants engaged with ontological questions about the fundamental nature of games; they showed strong opinions about the use of digital tools; they discussed the impacts of digital tools for game design as well as in their design practice; they raised concerns about the costs to develop and maintain such tools; and they considered how they affect the in-game player experience. From these themes, we generate five design principles for digital tools for boardgame play: traceability, completeness, integration, privacy, and materiality. Grounded in empirical data, these design principles guide game designers and researchers seeking to explore this novel design space. Our research focuses attention on the role of digital components in play and on the need for thoughtful implementation that considers the entire lifecycle of the game, from development through publication and, ultimately, archival access.",

      "abstract": "Users emotional engagement in a task is important for performance and motivation. Non-intrusive, computerized process measures of engagement have the potential to provide fine-grained access to underlying affective states and processes. Thus, the current work brings together subjective measures (questionnaires) and objective process measures (facial expressions and head movements) of emotions in order to examine users emotional engagement with respect to the absence or presence of game-elements. In particular, we randomly assigned 156 adult participants to either a spatial working memory task with or without game elements present, while their faces and head movements were recorded with a webcam during task execution. Positive and negative emotions were assessed before the task and twice during task execution using conventional questionnaires. We additionally examined whether perceived subjective effort, assumed to inherit a substantial affective component, manifests at a bodily expressive level alongside positive and negative emotions. Importantly, we explored the relationship between subjective and objective measures of emotions across the two tasks versions. We found a series of action units and head movements associated with the subjective experience of emotions as well as to subjective effort. Impacted by game elements, these associations often fit intuitively or lined up with findings from literature. As did a linear increase of blink (action unit 45) intensity relate to participants performing the task without game elements, presumably indicating disengagement in the more tedious task variant. On other occasions, associations between subjective and objective measures seemed indiscriminative or even contraindicated. Additionally, facial and bodily reactions and the resulting subjective-objective correspondences were rather consistent within, but not between the two task versions. Our work therefore both gains detailed access to automated emotion recognition and promotes its feasibility within research of game elements while highlighting the individuality and context dependency of emotional expressions.

      "abstract": "Over 2 million people across the United States are living with aphasia, the loss of language due to acquired brain injury. Aphasia is an invisible disability that may come with negative consequences for communication, community participation, and quality of life. Game-based rehabilitation is a promising solution to address unmet long-term recovery and psychosocial needs for people with aphasia. In this paper, we describe a participatory game design process that engages people with aphasia (PwA) in the creation of three hybrid digital-analog games. We detail methods for facilitating collaboration across language barriers and divergent professional expertise based on interviews and participant observations throughout our iterative design process. We also contribute a set of design principles synthesized from aphasia rehabilitation research, interviews and community data. We conclude with recommendations for pursuing community-empowered aphasia game design for this underserved population based on reflection from our co-design experience.",

Specifically, we aimed to explore the associations between videogame play and wellbeing among consumers of a first episode psychosis (FEP) service and further to compare their motivations for play, need satisfaction, passion for play and wellbeing to a control group. A sample of 88 people experiencing FEP (57 who played videogames and 31 who did not) and a control sample of 46 (all of whom played videogames) completed a survey containing a range of questionnaires related to the variables of interest. Key findings include that among those experiencing FEP, people who played videogames reported better wellbeing outcomes than those who did not. Among participants who played videogames, the FEP sample reported lower levels of need satisfaction through gaming, lower levels of harmonious passion, higher levels of external types of motivation and lower levels of internal types of motivation for play than the control group. Finally, the relationships between passion orientation (both harmonious and obsessive) and psychological distress were stronger in the control group than the FEP sample, suggesting that passion for gaming may be less influential on wellbeing for those experiencing FEP.

      "abstract": "By drawing on Joseph Beuys’s notion of “social sculpture” and bringing together the discussions on participation from participatory art, participatory design, and game design, this paper seeks to expand the notion of participation in digital play. The expansive definition of participation allows us to better grasp computer games as a critical platform for dialogue and action, and computer gameplay as a transformative process of sculpting social fabric. By analyzing existing games in light of the concept of social sculpture, this paper explores how Beuys’s central tenet—the discourse of participation—can “politicize” the practice of digital gaming and game design. Furthermore, the paper proposes a participation-centered game design approach that is politically responsible and engaging, attempting to arrive at new knowledge that will help to make games that can function as a platform for participation and social commentary.",

      "abstract": "The application of complex systems theories to the study of narratives proved able to offer a high heuristic value for the analysis of movies [24,26], TV series [35,36], music [45] and different other media with narrative capacity [cf. 20]. However, they were not yet thoroughly employed for the study of video game narratives. To address the relation between formal complexity and the complexity of response in video games, this paper conducts a contrastive analysis of two games of the Halo series, namely Halo 3 [6] and Halo 3 ODST [7]. Formal complexity is analyzed by applying Cutting’s [13] approach for counting (narratorial) complexity. The evaluation of the responses to the narratives of these games is based on crowdsourced data, through Hven’s [24] and Kiss and Willemsen’s [26] understanding of audience response. The findings reveal that a complex response is at least partly predictable through an analysis of the formal quantitative and qualitative/organizational aspects of narratives, and, ultimately, that narrative complexity is a factor in the appreciation of games by the audience. The paper also poses the basis for the identification of a ‘Goldilocks level of complexity’, which can maximize the appreciation of video games stories.",

      "abstract": "This work investigates how to digitally mediate perspective sharing and face-to-face conversations within groups of museum visitors. We use the case of a storytelling group game and explore the potential of mobile technology as a tool to facilitate perspective sharing activities. Using information asymmetry, a “Social Mediator” role is introduced: players’ choices get displayed only to a single group member, who thus undertakes a leading role. The findings of an experience prototyping user study with playtesting in situ show that participants effectively and naturally carried out the pertinent dialogue facilitation activities. We identify behavioral patterns and discuss the insights they offer, showcasing how they shaped the mobile design for the particular use-case. We conclude that the distribution of the Social Mediator role between participants could successfully facilitate perspective sharing within groups and reflect on its potential and limitations in different collocated game experiences.",

      "abstract": "The treatment of social anxiety through digital exposure therapy is challenging due to the cognitive properties of social anxiety—individuals need to be fully engaged in the task and feel themselves represented in the social situation; however, avatar customization has been shown to increase both engagement and social presence. In this paper, we harness techniques used in commercial games, and investigate how customizing self-representation in a novel digital exposure task for social anxiety influences the experience of social threat. In an online experiment with 200 participants, participants either customized their avatar or were assigned a predefined avatar. Participants then controlled the avatar through a virtual shop, where they had to solve a math problem, while a simulated audience within the virtual world observed them and negatively judged their performance. Our findings show that we can stimulate the fear of evaluation by others in our task, that fear is driven primarily by trait social anxiety, and that this relationship is strengthened for people higher in trait social anxiety. We provide new insights into the effects of customization in a novel therapeutic context, and embed the discussion of avatar customization into related work in social anxiety and human-computer interaction.

      "abstract": "Bolstered by a growing interest in simulating believable non-player characters (NPCs), work on NPC models has spanned topics such as planning, procedural storytelling, decision-making, and social dynamics. However, research groups work in isolation, designing and discussing their character models with disparate approaches, often using project-specific terminology. This makes it challenging to identify, classify, and accumulate existing knowledge. It is our position that since modelling of virtual characters has become an integral part of the scientific practice in our field, we must develop a common taxonomy to discuss these models. With this goal in mind, we conduct an in-depth analysis of a selection of projects, categorizing existing agent social interactions, and comparing results from research-based and commercial social simulation works in the entertainment domain. We conceptualize a taxonomy that classifies agent interactions by their social behaviours, inter-agent communication, knowledge flow, and the change in their relationships. We posit such a taxonomy would allow scientists to reproduce and evaluate existing models, collaborate on standards, share advances with other researchers and practitioners, allow for better communication and methodologies developed for new techniques, and allow for a more rigorous model-to-model analysis.",

Location-based games have gained the attention of exergame designers as they have been able to motivate people to exercise and spend time in outdoors. Studies have shown the impact of current exergames to intervene with sedentariness by containing some elements of nature and outdoor activities. However, it is unclear how location-based mobile exergames can engage users with nature throughout playing and exercising. This paper presents insights from an exploratory self-study of experiences provided by the most popular location-based mobile game, Pokémon GO, concerning its potential to engage players in outdoors.

      "abstract": "Due to the subjective and complex nature of topics like fun and enjoyment, the motivations for players engaging with interactive games are particularly difficult to explore. However, understanding player motivation within games is indisputably valuable for those wishing to succeed in this highly competitive industry. While numerous models exist to quantify the motivations felt by players, the industry is ever evolving, and emerging sub industries have\r\ngiven rise to new reasons to play. In this work, though a meta-ethnography study clustering 284 motivation metaphors extracted from 30 included papers, the Spheres of Motivation is proposed; a new preliminary typology which synthesizes the last three decades of player motivation research.",

      "abstract": "The discussion about what can Artificial Intelligence (AI) contribute to games has been running for a long time, however, recent advances in AI show promise of providing new kind of experiences for players and new tools for game developers. In contrast with the traditional Finite State Machine for interaction and response, we consider the scenario of Visual Question & Answering (VQA) - the automatic answering of a textual question about an image. VQA is a tool that can enrich possible answers by combining both visual and textual information. It is also trivial to extrapolate to a game setting without going away from the training domain. In this Work In Progress, we present two original prototypes designed to explore the potential of VQA in games and discuss preliminary findings originated through a Wizard of Oz (WOz) pilot study using VQA to investigate how people interact with such an AI algorithm.",

      "abstract": "While looking to the future, we have overlooked what is right before us. With new technology, haptics, rendering, virtual reality, we have spent much energy discussing immersion and presence, thinking sometimes about current technology, but often about hypothetical perfect experiences or future perfect technology.\r\n\r\nIn this, we have forgotten something rather fundamental: How do we in the first place decide to see a group of pixels on a screen as an object to which we have access, rather than as a picture of an object? This paper explores this question through a playable essay. At first, we may think that we will identify anything interactive as an object, but the playable essay demonstrates that this is much more complex and pragmatic, and that this identification has three steps – identifying pixels as an object rather than a picture, reasoning about the object as a specific type of object (such as a ball), and identifying it as a real instance of a type of object (such as a calculator).\r\n\r\nI conclude that we identify objects not with a general list of properties (like “being interactive” or “physical”), but on implicit rules that we use depending on the type of object we are considering, and on what we are trying to do at a given time. I identify nine such tentative rules. Finally, there are many kinds of video game worlds, from the default 3D worlds of many game engines to social worlds. Examining the Unity3D engine used to create the game, I argue that game worlds are fundamentally not designed as bottom-up simulations of a world, but are deliberately implemented in human categories, and that we understand them as such. Within that frame, our relation to video game objects is pragmatic, and we will accept pixels as objects when it is helpful to our goals and plans.",

In both stages, we employed the Player Experience Inventory (PXI), a validated tool designed to evaluate player experience. In Stage 1, player experience of VR games was investigated via an online survey with 100 participants. We found that Audio-Visual Appeal, Immersion, and Ease of Control contributed most to player experience in VR games. We found no relationship between player experience and age, time spent playing, VR experience, or VR headset. Stage 2 used remote experimentation to compare VR and non-VR games with 10 participants. We found that differences in player experience can be explained by the Immersion, Progress Feedback, and Curiosity constructs of the PXI.",

The art community has a long history of challenges and opportunities with the commercialization of art. More recently, there has also been an interest in the purchase of game art as investments or collecting. With the advent of blockchain currencies, NFTs have introduced a way for investors, collectors, and game developers to purchase or sell game art. However, the potential of NFT for the games and game development industry is manifold. In this paper, the authors will reflect on the potential of NTF's for game developers and content creators. ",

While gamification has proven to be a promising means of motivating people and encouraging behavioral change, its application to the context of pro-environmental behavior in the workplace is still in its infancy. This thesis aims to investigate how gamification interventions need to be designed to encourage employees to engage in sustainability, and whether gamification leads to measurable reductions in corporate emissions. By applying design science research methodology, theoretical and empirical research iteratively generate knowledge about this novel field of application and lead to a theoretically grounded gamification design and evaluation, aiming to demonstrate the revolutionary potential of gamification for sustainability in SMEs.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we explore the factorial structure of the Ubisoft Perceived Experience Questionnaire (UPEQ) and its correlation with game enjoyment. For this purpose, an online survey was conducted on the experience with the video game League of Legends. Three hundred and sixty-nine participants provided information about their in- and out-of-game demographics and rated their experience with the game using the UPEQ and the subscale Interest/Enjoyment from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory. Using confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis, we found weaknesses in the 3-factor model of the UPEQ and propose a 6- or 7-factor structure as a basis for new research and improvement of the UPEQ.

      "abstract": "Chest physical therapy—including chest percussion, vibration, and postural drainage—is an important part of cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment. Chest percussion and vibration are exercises that require coordinated effort between patient and caregiver, during which the caregiver performs manual, rhythmic blows to the patient's chest and back. When practiced regularly alongside postural drainage techniques, percussion therapy mobilizes and removes fluid buildup in the lungs, reducing inflammation and risks of infection that could lead to hospitalization. Despite the importance of chest physical therapy for those with CF, adherence is often low. Low adherence to at-home therapies is common to the treatment of many diseases, yet one distinct challenge of chest physical therapy is the caregiver intervention—a role often assumed by a family member or loved one. The caregiver role is challenging for chest therapy because it is active, focused, and strenuous. While research has proposed many solutions for increasing patient engagement during similar airway clearance exercises, the critical role of the caregiver has often been overlooked. In this paper, we present Percussion Hero, a cooperative, rhythm-based game designed to improve chest physical therapy adherence by actively targeting both patients and caregivers during therapeutic exercises.

In detail, we raised the question of whether subjects will experience a higher degree of social presence towards a companion when this companion acts more autonomously than a companion that does not show any autonomous behavior? We created an experimental setting with two conditions realized via a puzzle game prototype to investigate this question. Ten subjects took part in a study (within-subject design). Results show that, in general, companions with a higher degree of autonomy lead to a higher degree of social presence. However, this applies only to basic forms of social presence. Some players noted that the social bond did not go beyond the game. With our discoveries, we want to provide researchers insights into pet companions' design in games and help game designers create social bonds between the players and their companions.",

      "abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) applications have shown to be extremely valuable for  entertainment and educational purposes. AR experiences support the learning performance of scientific subjects by providing visualization of phenomena and abstract concepts. This process facilitates the transfer of 2D information into 3D mental models, a cognitive process essential in the Chemistry domain. In the pages that follow, we contribute to the design and development of two AR serious games that combine participatory design with human-computer interaction principles to introduce Periodic Table concepts to 9-13-year old children. We present initial findings regarding the children’s acceptance and satisfaction of the games, usability, engagement and overall feedback from our target audience. Although the overall assessment showed positive results in AR’s entertainment value and usability, a preliminary pilot test (N=7) using a mix-method approach identified the need for minor game-play interventions. We aim to optimize our games by continuing our research with our target audience, analyzing their feedback, making refinements and assessing the game's learning effectiveness. Our purpose is to research and create guidelines for designing AR serious games to facilitate the learning of abstract concepts while supporting spatial skills. We also aim to change student perception of Chemistry as challenging and dull, and to motivate children to invest in this area.",

      "abstract": "Loneliness, an emotional distress caused by the lack of meaningful social connections, has been increasingly affecting university students who need to deal with everyday situations in a new setting, especially those who have come from abroad. Currently there is little work on digital solutions to reduce loneliness. Therefore, this work describes the general design considerations for mobile apps in this context and outlines a potential solution. The mobile app Noneliness is used to this end: it aims to reduce loneliness by creating social opportunities through a quest-based gamified system in a secure and collaborative network of local users. The results of initial evaluations with the target audience are described. The results informed a user interface redesign as well as a review of the features and the gamification principles adopted.",

      "abstract": "Fun is often considered as an essential element of learning, especially among researchers in gamification and child-computer interaction. Accordingly, enjoyment of a (non-formal) learning activity or game is frequently an important design and evaluation criteria. However, while it is often declared that learning games and playful learning activities are fun for children, empirical evidence is hard to come by as measuring fun is not straightforward. Hence, to start my PhD research, I have defined fun and designed and validated a measurement tool (FunQ) for the quantitative assessment of fun. Thereafter, by using FunQ I have investigated the effect of fun on learning. My research results indicate that fun has a positive and significant effect on learning and it also has a significant indirect positive effect on learning across influencing students' attitude about the topic. In my next study, I am planning to do an intervention to see how teachers can support by means of for example scaffolding the experienced fun while learning, and by this, enhance students’ learning experience and their level of learning. My aim is to turn research into practice by providing teachers with guidelines for a more fun and more effective learning.",

They are also used in education, both to teach their intrinsic concepts and as a tool to support learning in other areas. There has been extensive research into generating and efficiently solving puzzle game levels, though comparatively little has focused on creating a challenging yet intriguing puzzle solving experience for a given human player. We conducted an initial study into how human players approach the solving of paper puzzle games, using Sudoku, and how that corresponded to the assumptions made by computational solvers. The intention is to use this insight to build a general help system that better reflects and supports the solving process employed by human players when solving puzzle games. ",

      "abstract": "In recent years, and especially in times of distance learning, Serious Games have become a viable alternative to conventional teaching methods. The positive effect of Serious Games on learning motivation and learning success has already been confirmed in many studies. At the same time, educational institutions and companies are becoming more open to the use of digital Serious Games. However, the development of these games is a great challenge, because aspects of Game Design as well as aspects of Learning Design have to be included in the development. Therefore, it is important to identify deficits or optimization potentials regarding both aspects in the early stages of development already. This study uses an example to show possibilities for identifying optimization needs in early development stages and proposes improvement measures in the field of Game and Learning Design using a prototype as an example. The prototype was tested by five lecturers of the same subject domain and assessed in terms of content and didactic suitability for teaching. In addition, an AttrakDiff evaluation was performed.",

      "abstract": "Understanding and reflecting on gender identity is important for many individuals across the spectrum of gender, whether they are trans/gender diverse, questioning and/or cisgender. Games have potential to support and provide safe spaces and tools for such explorations, but their design presents challenges of its own. This research seeks to understand how playful spaces allow for meaningful exploration and positive experiences of gender identity that is supportive of diversity and fluidity across the spectrum of gender, and how this can be enhanced. We aim to examine how games can allow exploration of gender in a more nuanced, inclusive way, so that more individuals can explore their identity across multiple dimensions (physical, cognitive, behavioural, affective and social) and find ways to express this in playful ways. Exploratory, qualitative methods will be used to develop an in-depth understanding of how technology can accomplish this with end users. Through examining prototypes developed by participants, we will interrogate the potential for technology to address these different dimensions of gender, to enhance reflection and exploration of identity away from stereotypical, binary norms.",

      "abstract": "The conceptualisation of play for play’s sake transcends its inherent health, educational or developmental benefits and is viewed as a child’s primary occupation.  By examining play from this perspective, the intrinsic influence of the doing of play contributing to the child’s being is acknowledged.  The proliferation of technology in an ever-connected world offers increasingly diverse digital spaces for children to play.  Such digital spaces present new opportunities for children to co-create new expressions of play; whether alone, with friends, in real and in make-believe worlds.  Despite literature in relation to play in digital spaces coming from a plethora of academic fields, this occupational perspective of play as a child-centred, autotelic pursuit remains largely ignored.  This research will explore digital play choices, experiences, and outcomes from children’s unique perspective.  Furthermore, this research aims to reflect the rights and agency of children as meaning-makers and active contributors (Clark, 2017; Green et al., 2021), using creative and adaptive approaches throughout the research process. It is envisioned that this research will contribute to the understanding of the autotelic nature of play in digital spaces.  Such understanding will assist children and adults to leverage technology to ensure that meaningful playful experiences proliferate in the future.",

      "abstract": "More than 18 months after it was first identified, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to restrict researchers' opportunities to conduct research in face-to-face settings. This affects studies requiring participants to be co-located, such as those that examine the play of multiplayer boardgames. We present two methods for observing the play of boardgames at a distance, supported by two case studies. We report on the value and use of both methods, and reflect on five core concepts that we observed during the studies: data collection and analysis, recruitment and participation, the temporality of play, the sociality of play and material engagement, and the researcher's role in the study. This work highlights the different considerations that online studies generate when compared to in-person play and other study methods. Future work will present an in-depth discussion of the findings of these studies and present recommendations for the adoption of these distinct methods",

      "abstract": "Current research on Explainable AI (XAI) heavily targets on expert users (data scientists or AI developers). However, increasing importance has been argued for making AI more understandable to nonexperts, who are expected to leverage AI techniques, but have limited knowledge about AI. We present a mobile application to support nonexperts to interactively make sense of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); it allows users to play with a pre-trained CNN by taking pictures of their surrounding objects. We use an up-to-date XAI technique (Class Activation Map) to intuitively visualize the model’s decision (the most important image regions that lead to a certain result). Deployed in a university course, this playful learning tool was found to support design students to gain vivid understandings about the capabilities and limitations of pre-trained CNNs in real-world environments. Concrete examples of students’ playful explorations are reported to characterize their sensemaking processes reflecting different depths of thought.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Brain-to-Brain interfaces (BBIs) are systems that facilitate direct information transmission between two brains via a com- bination of neuroimaging and neuromodulation technologies. These systems can stimulate one user’s brain based on the neural signals of another. While Brain-Computer Interfacing is often discussed in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) game and play community, BBI is underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the social play potentials of BBI systems by proposing three types of \"telepathic play experiences\" based on a wearable BBI system called \"PsiNet\" which we designed, engineered, and evaluated in a previous study. This system measures the neural activity of players via electroencephalogram (EEG) as the input to the system and stimulates associated brain activity in other users using transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) as the system output. We hope this work will inspire game design researchers to create novel play experiences using neurotechnology such as BBI systems.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Digital games featuring programmable agents are popular tools for teaching coding and computational thinking skills. However, today’s games perpetuate an arguably obsolete relationship between programmable agents and human operators. Borrowing from the field of human-robotics interaction, we argue that collaborative robots, or cobots, are a better model for thinking about computational agents, working directly with humans rather than in place of or at arm’s length from them. In this paper, we describe an initial design inquiry into the design of “cobot games”, programmable agent scenarios in which players program an in-game ally to assist them in accomplishing gameplay objectives. We detail three questions that emerged out of this exploration, our present thinking on them, and plans for deepening inquiry into cobot game design moving forward.",

      "abstract": "Art is a creative, intuitive process which engages us on an emotional level. It involves experimentation, spontaneity, and play. Just as a painter may use the same brush with different mark-making techniques on the surface of their canvas, a clay sculptor may use one knife to scratch, texture, slice or create bas reliefs. To an artist, the tool and the medium as a whole are subject to spontaneous, nuanced decision making and use in multitudinous ways which are core to the art. In this work-in-progress paper, we hope to inspire renewed interest in intuitive digital art creation. We argue that the modern state-of-the-art 3D creation software fails to recreate the tactile feeling and complexity of the real-world tools because they treat their `tools' as rigid operators. To explore ways to better accommodate the creative process, we present a Virtual Reality (VR) application, titled Virtual Materiality, that provides a set of digital sculpting tools that feel more like traditional analog tools. In this work, we generalize a `physical sculpting tool', enabling users to deform our virtual clay in a more realistic, mass-conserving manner. Future work is planned to incorporate more interactions that one might expect with real clay, and to evaluate the efficacy of this new digital sculpting modality.",

      "abstract": "Expert evaluation is commonly employed in usability research as it is fast and cost-effective. However, as it heavily relies on evaluators' expertise, it is associated with problems of subjective interpretation. This is particularly noticeable in the games user research (GUR) field as games often aim to reach broad audiences and complex experiences in comparison to other applications. One way to improve the problems associated with subjective interpretation is to augment the evaluation with data collected from players. However collecting data from players can be time-consuming, expensive, and challenging to construct representative player samples. Building on our previous research on automated agent-based playtesting, in this work-in-progress paper we detail our new project in supplementing expert evaluation with simulated player data generated by a configurable population of artificial intelligence (AI) players.",

The game is based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and intends to map therapeutic principles – such as Behavioral Activation (BA), motivation for change and cognitive flexibility  – to game mechanics and gameplay. As such, as players progress in the game, they undergo an ecological momentary intervention in a playful way, which teaches them coping strategies, stimulates behavioral change and an active lifestyle. Once the game is fully developed, a validation with real patients under guidance of a therapist is foreseen.",

      "abstract": "In the past decade, a lot of attention has been given to the detection and classification of stress. With the advancement of technology, a lot of psychology-based experiments to detect stress have been digitized. The major problem with these experiments is the accurate annotation of the collected user data. This problem arises because of a lack of user engagement with the stimulus used to induce stress. The more is engagement the closer will be the accuracy of the annotations. Games have been proven to have a high degree of user engagement. In this research, several models to detect stress have been discussed. Stressors have been designed and curated in a free-to-play game ‘Unlock Me’.\r\nThe initial results demonstrate that our proposed method can be used to devise systems for identifying if a person is feeling stressed in their own natural environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However, the translation from learning science theory to practice is not well studied, and no previous study has examined how the presentation format of learning science principles may influence the effectiveness of a realistic, collaborative game design process between designers and teachers. In this paper, we present the initial design of a study that will examine how the forms and presentation of learning science principles might influence designer-teacher collaboration, which has both theoretical and practical implications in the fields of educational game design and learning science.",

      "abstract": "Voice input has been used interactively in games for a long time. Existing voice games showed the potential of voice input games by utilizing various features of voice such as voice volume detection, pitch and rhythm detection, speech recognition, and conversation.\r\nHowever, most of these conventional voice games showed that the main game characteristics depended only on the voice input. In this context, we propose \\textit{Harmonionz}, a two-player collaborative game that goes beyond the limits of the existing voice input game genre. Our game has a novelty in which the voice plays a functional and story-wise core role, but the fun of the game is not limited to the voice.\r\nIn our game, players can win the game when they explore a colorful map, avoid enemies, and eventually create a pitch required by the target with their voice. Each player has a different role. One defeats the approaching enemies and the other creates the pitch. The target pitch is mapped to the color to indicate players the color of the notes that they need to make. Players must find the required pitch by looking at the color on the target. \r\nThe fun part of conventional voice input games was the voice itself only. However, voice input in our game can easily interact with overall game design including shooting and team-work. The worldview of our game, colorizing the pitch in order to interact with the colorful map, interacting with the background music are our attempts to make our game contextually and logically persuasive.",

      "abstract": "Conversation is a key element in maintaining social relationships. In contrast to soliloquy, conversation with other people gives various social effects to both speaker and listener. Most voice communication in games had been bound to achieving games goal, thus not fully facilitates social effects. Therefore, we tried to deliver the positive effects of the conversation by gamifying turn-taking communication. With “Anyway,” we present a two-player conversational defense game that uses voice conversation as an input. This game aims to encourage wholesome in-game conversation and to expand the boundary of the game’s use of voice interaction in game. In “Anyway,” players have to proceed with their talk to protect their partner from incoming waves. Spoken words from each player are converted to tetrapod breakwaters that only protect their playmate, which leads to a cooperative game experience. We conducted a preliminary user test and observed positive responses, especially in empathy and behavioral involvement.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Fostering equal design partnerships in adult-child codesign interactions is a well-documented challenge in HCI. It is assumed that adults come into these interactions with power and have to make adjustments to allow childrens’ input to be equally valued. However, power is not a unilateral construct - it is in part determined by social and cultural norms that often disadvantage minoritized groups. Striving for equal partnership without centering users’ and participants’ intersectional identities may lead to unproductive adult-child codesign interactions. We codesigned a game, primarily facilitated by a black woman researcher, with K-5 afterschool programs comprised of students from three different communities – a middle-class, racially diverse community; a low-income, primarily African American community; and a working-class rural, white, community over a period of 20 weeks. We share preliminary insights on how racial and gender biases affect codesign partnerships and describe future research plans to modify our program structure to foster more effective adult-child interactions.",

      "abstract": "Our growing reliance on technologies is bringing to the forefront ethical and cultural biases built into digital spaces. In this work-in-progress we examine the relationship between algorithms and culture and present a novel gaming experience for youth to engage in algorithmic literacy practices. While there are many opportunities for learners to engage in computer science education, we found that educators often feel underprepared to engage in teaching algorithmic literacy practices. Additionally, we identify there is a need for more educational content that introduces ethical dilemmas related to the use of algorithms to collect, track and sort data to make decisions about who gets access to certain opportunities. Screening Bot is a narrative-driven sandbox game in which learners play the role of a policing bot in charge of monitoring access to a space habitat which provides better living conditions for populations across the galaxy. While learners create algorithms to determine who enters the new habitat, they will find out that even the best algorithms can be subject to bias. This game will invite learners and educators to examine current bias in algorithmic models and help them become more reflective about the tensions related to algorithms in their lives.",

      "abstract": "Designing games is hard. To support player interaction, someone must decide not only what a player might do, but also what they should observe and how the game should respond to each of their actions. While these decisions are often made solely by a game's designers, they are sometimes shared with players, providing one or more ways to change how the game works. How might interacting with such a flexible game system affect a player's experience of the game? Unfortunately, it remains unclear how or whether game design frameworks can be used to help answer this question, as they tend to focus on player actions that change the game's state. As more games blur the lines between settings screens and gameplay or designers and players, new or refined conceptual tools are needed to support the design of flexible game systems. We present our ongoing work to build a conceptual \"adapter\" for existing tools, allowing game designers to apply their current toolbox to this task. ",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the pilot version of Viruscape, a novel adventure PC and console game designed to facilitate the conceptual learning of Coronavirus mechanisms and expand the civic science education toolkit. Medical illustration using 3D modeling and motion graphics software has long been a niche practice to help advance education, research, and practice in healthcare-related fields. In Viruscape, we leverage the unexploited potential of such software to create interactive virtual worlds and gameplay experience to promote a more systematic learning of human health concepts and advance medical literacy for the general public. Viruscape immerses players in a microscopic world through the “eyes” of viruses whose goal is to defeat the human immune system. We translate the relevant immunology mechanisms into game play mechanisms that players learn to master, while providing a unique and interactive gaming experience. Future development of the game could focus on involving diverse users and health experts in co-design or consultation sessions and customizing the game world to represent players’ real-world health condition. The concept of Viruscape can be used to further develop parallel episodes of the game that feature other human health mechanisms such as other types of infection, heart disease or cancer. ",

      "abstract": "Frozen Factory is a cooperative puzzle game for the Oculus Quest VR headset for two co-located players. Both players slip into the role of two penguin workers, in a world that seems to be a vast ice cream factory. However, they are actually tiny penguins inside a Frozen Factory branded vending machine! Your job: create a tasty ice cream for a demanding customer! The key to success... co-operation! Both players must complete a series of chaotic co-operative tasks against the clock. From baking the cone, to whipping cream, to literally putting the cherry on top.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we want to reflect the development of the game and share insights that we gained while working on a title with a lot of innovative interaction techniques. The game is entirely built for standalone VR headsets and aims for a unique, easy-to-learn and presence-enhancing user experience. No wires, no tracking stations, and also no controllers are needed. The players just need to mount the headset and can play entirely with hand-tracking. Interactions do not involve complicated gestures. It is just everyday-actions such as pushing, pulling or touching.\r\n\r\nOne of the most unique things is the locomotion technique. Instead of using joystick steering or teleportation, the game leverages redirected walking techniques which guide the players on paths in the virtual world that differ from those in the real world. Both players share a 5x3 m play space. Inside this space, they can roam freely. Redirections are deeply integrated into the gameplay & interactions. ",

Previous studies have developed virtual reality prototypes to train decision-making. However, the training of decision-making skills for professional Australian Football League (AFL) players is still unexplored. We are collaborating with AFL specialists to validate components of decision-making training prototype that would benefit their athletes. The study proposes design guidelines for a virtual reality experience for decision-making training for AFL players based on the result of the decision-making training experiment using the prototype developed. This paper presents the work in progress, covering preliminary results from a prototyping workshop investigating the design and future deployment of a virtual reality prototype. Among the current findings, we identify the importance of spatial awareness and propose methods to elevate the spatial awareness of AFL players inside the virtual reality space.",

      "abstract": "Today’s digital natives easily master new devices, but there is a greater need to provide them with a strong foundation of attitudes, skills and values to interpret the world around them. Moreover, in the context of remote schooling, providing students with opportunities to learn outside of the classroom and in an interactive manner is equally important. In this article, we address these issues by providing an account of Escape Fake, an augmented reality (AR) escape room game for educating young people about fake news. We show how such a game can be designed for playing at home, thereby providing interactive learning opportunities remotely. We discuss how to teach information literacy, by introducing the design process and gameplay of Escape Fake. In our evaluation with teenagers and young adults (n=49), we investigated the flow experience, attitude towards learning effectiveness and interest in learning with an AR escape game. Escape Fake was very well accepted by youth, who are willing to play the game in their free time. These results provide considerations for educators, researchers and designers who develop educational content by means of AR escape rooms. ",

      "abstract": "The aim of this research is to increase prosocial behaviour using video game rewards. Prosocial behaviours are actions that have a positive impact on others. Previous research has established that players who help non-player characters in video games perceive themselves as having performed a prosocial act. An increase of prosocial self-concept from the videogame can transfer to real-life, encouraging follow-up prosocial behaviour. Videogame rewards are an established means of extrinsically motivating player engagement but may reduce long term engagement for activities such as prosocial behaviours. Administering informational rewards, those that provide effectance relevant feedback, has been suggested to overcome this issue but has not been investigated in a videogame context. Using a custom-built videogame across 3 online experimental studies, this thesis aims to fill this gap by manipulating reward types for in-game prosocial behaviour and measuring the follow-up prosocial behaviour engagement using a real-life charitable donation.",

      "abstract": "Immersive, educational games may increase engagement and offer new affordances in assessment. Many aspects of instruction may be amenable to gameplay—but the degree of success often depends on student (and instructor) engagement. Commercial games tend to have vibrant engagement from school-aged children, but when transformed for instructional purposes, often break critical immersive gameplay elements or the established protocols of instruction. Moreover, educational game design is limited by the relevance these games have toward existing content standards and the degree to which core gameplay remains intact when educational elements are added. To this end, we present a methodology, called DeCoAD—Decomposition, Connection, and Activity Design, for learning scientists and game developers to design and evaluate immersive game mechanics for specific content standards. The three phases of the methodology guide collaborators in (1) decomposing a learning standard and an existing commercial video game into their basic elements, and (2) identifying the game’s potential capabilities to facilitate learning opportunities related to the learning standard. Furthermore, we provide examples from our ongoing experience in creating educational game mechanics for Minecraft, with evaluation from an advisory panel of critical stakeholders.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected face-to-face social interaction with and among relational partners - relatives, friends, and others. Prior to the pandemic, many people relied on face-to-face social play experiences to help them maintain relationships and satisfy relatedness needs. However, growing coronavirus-related concerns have made such activities unwelcome or inaccessible, leading many to turn to technology-mediated experiences, as a safer alternative means of supporting recreational play with non-proximal relational partners. But how does one design technology-mediated recreational play experiences to satisfy a diverse range of user needs, interests, and preferences? To explore this area of interest we study the social experience afforded by the multiplayer game, Among Us. We conduct a diary study with students enrolled in an undergraduate HCI course and report on the findings of a post-study reflective activity. Our findings highlight that casual interdependent games that explicitly and implicitly foster social interaction among players, do provide opportunities for satisfying remote play social experiences when augmented by rich communication technologies.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present the results of a design project that was funded by the German Federal Foreign Office. The project, ‘Perspectives in Play’, aimed at the creation of board games that educate about foreign policy through play. The results include build-up strategy games about climate change, knowledge games about differences between cultures and countries, and discussion games about opinion, truth, resource management and law-making. The collection includes both competitive and collaborative games for group sizes of between two and 27 players. We present the games and initial user reactions, which we collected in informal surveys after users had tried out the games. We discuss our findings, concluding that printable board games have great potential to help political education gain in complexity by embracing new formats that offer a variety of innovative learning styles.",

      "abstract": "Battle Royale is a popular online multiplayer game genre that combines last-man-standing shooter gameplay with survival, combat, and scavenging elements. Since several abilities beyond basic combat skills affect player performance in game, the learning curve can be steep for many players. To enhance the gameplay experience, we propose the AI Coach algorithm to provide personalized and adaptive coaching suggestions to Apex Legends players. The proposed algorithm first models player game skills with a comprehensive set of in-game attributes using a random forest. Then, it artificially perturbs individual player data to search for impactful candidate attributes and the associated actions that an individual player can use to improve their game skill. The AI Coach technique provides automated and objective suggestions based on players' recent gameplay data, optimizing expected game outcomes. \r\n\r\nWe examined the efficacy of the AI Coach on Apex Legends recommendations using expected game performance improvement and a retrospective study. Our study results showed that a player's acceptance of the top three coaching tips is associated with 4-7% improvement in expected player skill measurement. In addition, the retrospective study indicated that players who naturally accepted the top suggestions exhibit significant improvement in skill compared to players who did not.",

      "abstract": "Depression is the world's most prevalent mental disorder and the primary source of disability adjusted life years (DALY). While traditional face-to-face therapies have been shown to be effective, alternative delivery methods, e.g. internet-based therapies, have been investigated to overcome barriers to access, such as lack of availability of therapists and infrastructure. This article presents the design of a mobile serious game as a novel psychological momentary ecological intervention for depressive symptoms. We discuss how selected principles and techniques of common psychological frameworks used to tackle depression, namely Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (including Behavioral Activation) and Positive Psychotherapy, were integrated in the game concept, gameplay and game mechanics of \"Horizon: Resilience\", a City Building and Decision Making serious game. The selected techniques are put central in the game design by introducing \"the Power R(esilience)\", which groups the psychological principles of motivation for change, cognitive flexibility, activation and positivity. While identifying with game characters and maintaining high levels of the Power R, the players are introduced to and learn to use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Positive Psychotherapy strategies, which they can ultimately apply in their real-life depressive symptomatology.",

      "abstract": "Motor movements are performed while playing hand-games such as Rock-paper-scissors or Thumb-war. These games are believed to benefit both physical and mental health and are considered cultural assets. Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) is a technology that can actuate muscles, triggering motor movements and hence offers an opportunity for novel play experiences based on these traditional hand-games. However, there is only limited understanding of the design of EMS games. We present the design and evaluation of two games inspired by traditional hand-games, \"Slap-me-if-you-can\" and \"3-4-5\", which incorporate EMS and can be played alone, unlike traditional games. A thematic analysis of the data collected revealed three themes: 1) Gameplay experiences and influence of EMS hardware, 2) Interaction with EMS and the calibration process and, 3) Shared control and its effect on playing EMS games. We hope that an enhanced understanding of the potential of EMS to support hand-games can aid the advancement of movement-based games as a whole.",

      "abstract": "Sedentary lifestyles have posed threats to people’s physical and mental well-being worldwide. Researchers developed exergames to address people’s sedentary lifestyle by encouraging body movement through an entertaining game approach. Our research proposed an innovative ball interface and evaluated the effects of the ball interface on physical activities with and without extra weights. We conducted a user study with 14 participants to evaluate their experiences and physical activities elicited in three interface conditions: Mouse, Ball, and Weighted Ball.We collected participants’ heart rate (HR), Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE), and Self-Assessment Manikin ratings (SAM), and conducted a semi-structured interview.We found that both the Ball and Weighted Ball conditions facilitated moderate-intensity workouts and more physical activities than the at-rest and the Mouse conditions. However, we didn’t observe any significant improvement of physical activities in the Weighted Ball condition compared to the Ball condition. Our research contributes to the exergames research field and HCI community by bringing more understanding and insights towards the ball interface, including participants’ acceptance and experiences, the ball interface’s effectiveness of fostering physical activities, and design considerations for future research.",

      "abstract": "While non-player opponents in commercial video games often rely on simple artificial intelligence techniques, machine learning techniques that capture human strategies could make them more engaging. Cognitive Shadow is a prototype tool that combines several artificial intelligence techniques to continuously model human decision-making patterns during tasks that require categorical decision-making. The present study aims to assess the potential of Cognitive Shadow to create learning opponents that will counter the player’s decisions in a strategy game, making it more challenging and engaging. The game developed to this end is a more complex version of rock-paper-scissors, set within the context of a wizards’ duel. Each participant (Player 1) took part in three game sessions of 12 battles (each including five rounds), only being told that they would face a non-player opponent. During Session 1, Cognitive Shadow was in learning mode, thus the non-player opponent (Player 2) chose its plays at random. During Session 2, Cognitive Shadow was active and helped counter participants’ decisions without their knowledge. Before Session 3, participants were informed that their opponent was using machine learning to anticipate and counter their strategy. The results showed that Player 2 was more effective with the help of Cognitive Shadow, having won significantly more battles in Sessions 2 and 3 than in Session 1. In addition, the level of engagement reported by human players increased significantly in Session 3. These results indicate that cognitive shadowing can be used in a strategy game to increase engagement when players are aware of the learning behavior.",

      "abstract": "Research results show that gamification can influence emotions, motivation and behavior. However, in order to apply the results in the software development in industry, they need to be easily accessible. To enable a knowledge transfer, a concept and a prototype for an interactive web-based tool were designed to summarize and visualize existing research results and practical examples in a simplified way regarding the use of gamification elements. Step by step, the user defines parameters such as context of use, age, gender and user type for the target group. Based on this, effects in research results are presented simplified and sorted in four categories in pie charts.\r\nThis is intended to provide users in the industry with the competence to select appropriate gamification elements for their usage. The approach was developed in a user-centered way, including pre-study interviews with seven participants from research and / or industry, and then evaluated using a clickable prototype and qualitative open interviews. Potentials for industry and research were examined. The approach was perceived as supportive in selecting appropriate gamification elements for use in industry. It may lead to faster finding of research results, promote networking and may generate a kind of meta review. The elaboration of such tools may support the interconnection between research and industry, as well as the transfer and applicability of knowledge in gamification.",

      "abstract": "Gamifying experiments in-the-wild showed promising opportunities in supporting participants’ engagement, increasing sample size and diversity, and saving lab and personnel resources needed for lab experiments. However, transforming memory lab experiments to mobile games is challenging as some standard game design guidelines jeopardize the validity of the experimental design. Our work draws attention to this trade-off by providing design guidelines for critical game elements, namely scoring systems and input methods. We distil those guidelines from a case study where we replicated a lab memory experiment via a mobile game apparatus and produced congruent psychological results. Our work sheds the light on the special challenges in gamifying memory experiments and encourages psychologists and game designers to investigate human memory in natural settings. ",

      "abstract": "In this paper we describe our experiences in running a workshop aimed at exploring the use of playful food interactions as a means of uncovering design insights for child oriented food technologies and experiences. The workshop was originally planned as an in-person event in which we could jointly experience the gustatory and olfactory elements of the food items at hand and interact with their tactile properties. However, as a result of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, we converted the workshop into a virtual event in which participants had to convey their multisensory food experiences and ideas through the limited sight and sound capabilities offered by online platforms such as Zoom and Miro. We report on the methods used and reflect on how the constraints of digital mediation and the desire of participants to overcome these constraints shaped the experience and outcome of the workshop.",

We therefore develop an eye tracking supported Virtual Reality serious game for school-aged children, realizing gaze interactions to promote attention towards, and positive experiences during exposure to spiders. Within pilot studies in adults (n=30) and children (n=14) without fear of spiders, we assessed positive and negative affect during prototype gaze feedback through five different variants: If gazed for few seconds, the virtual spider changed into a shrunk, a rainbow coloured, or dying spider, or morphed into a smileyball, or speaks friendly. We found the highest positive affect for the rainbow and smileyball variant, followed by the shrunk and friendly speaking variant. In contrast, the dying variant was excluded due to the possible induction of negative affect. Findings indicate eligible variants for the further development of the VR serious game.",

In this study, a persuasive game was designed that explores themes of blame culture and impact of citizen behaviour on others during a pandemic. Notably, it breaks the “magic circle” by asking players to involve their real-world actions in gameplay. Quantitative results showed participant attitudes became more aligned to the game’s message immediately after and two days after playing the game. Qualitative feedback indicated that the technique of breaking the “magic circle” was very effective for encouraging reflection and engaging the player. The outcomes of this study suggest that this is a promising technique that should be explored in future work, particularly over a longer time frame.",

      "abstract": "Digital games are playing an increasingly important role in today's youth culture. Related phenomena, such as Let's Plays and e-sports are consumed by numerous adolescents but are also becoming increasingly prominent as career choices. This paper presents the results of a group interview with experts in the field of digital gaming and embeds the findings in a project that aims to elaborate pedagogical potentials of these practices in a school context. Our participants provide insights into their careers and, based on their experiences, discuss possible barriers to Let's Plays and streaming in the pedagogical field, but also elaborate on competencies that can be strengthened through the creative, self-determined creation of gameplay-based media.",

      "abstract": "Myopia is an eye condition that makes it difficult for people to focus on faraway objects. It has become one of the most serious eye conditions worldwide and negatively impacts the quality of life of those who suffer from it. Although myopia is prevalent, many non-myopic people have misconceptions about it and encounter challenges empathizing those who suffer from it. In this research, we developed two virtual reality (VR) games, (1) \"Myopic Bike\" and (2) \"Say Hi\", to provide a means for the non-myopic population to experience the difficulties of myopic people. Our two games simulate two inconvenient daily life scenarios (riding a bicycle and greeting friends on the street) that myopic people encounter when not wearing glasses. The goal is to facilitate empathy in people with non-myopia for those who suffer from myopia. We evaluated four participants' game experiences through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Overall, our two VR games can create an engaging and non-judgmental experience for the non-myopic people that has potential to facilitate empathizing with those who suffer from myopia.",

      "abstract": "Thousands of children are adopted both domestically and internationally every year. Many come from institutional or foster care and suffer from complex trauma, abuse and neglect, which negatively affect their transition and attachment with their adoptive families [20] To help, social workers often use a counseling technique called play therapy to help children incapable of verbalizing and expressing themselves to communicate and work through difficult subjects using objects and toys [22]. The play therapy space is a hands-on, sensory-rich play environment with a wide variety of materials and activities for children to choose from, so design solutions focused on shifting play therapy into the virtual realm using advanced gaming technologies. \r\n\r\nMythos is a video game where adopted children and children with trauma role play as a stuffed bear, who's lost their home and finds themselves on a journey of self-discovery. The game uses a variety of game-based learning techniques to accommodate children at different developmental levels. To ensure optimal outcomes, the game will be partnered with therapy and a physical stuffed bear. Preliminary reviews by a group of play therapists suggest the game has the potential to be a viable therapeutic tool for use with adopted children and children with trauma.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Digitalization is changing how people visit museums and explore the artifacts they house. Museums, as important educational venues outside classrooms, need to actively explore the application of digital interactive media, including games that can balance entertainment and knowledge acquisition. In this paper, we introduce RelicVR, a virtual reality (VR) game that encourages players to discover artifacts through physical interaction in a game-based approach. Players need to unearth artifacts hidden in a clod enclosure by using available tools and physical movements. The game relies on the dynamic voxel deformation technique to allow players to chip away earth covering the artifacts. We added uncertainty in the exploration process to bring it closer to how archaeological discovery happens in real life. Players do not know the shape or features of the hidden artifact and have to take away the earth gradually but strategically without hitting the artifact itself. From playtesting sessions with eight participants, we found that the uncertainty is conducive to their engagement and exploration experience. Overall, RelicVR is an innovative game that can improve players' learning motivation and outcomes of ancient artifacts.",

      "abstract": "When we make ethical decisions in everyday life, our choices are often influenced by what we see others doing around us. In psychology, this phenomenon is known as social proof. When we are uncertain about what to do, we are likely to follow the crowd, especially if we identify with them. In this study, we examine how this behaviour extends to video games, and how it is influenced by other design factors such as time-limited decisions. We present the results of a quantitative study of player behaviour in a visual-novel game The Great Fire. Before making a decision, players are presented with statistics showing what other players chose. We manipulated these figures to display different choices as popular, under timed and untimed conditions. We present preliminary work-in-progress results that suggest that players are indeed influenced to follow the crowd when facing an ambiguous moral decision, but can also show unexpected behaviour when faced with the non-moral choice of calling a coin flip.",

A qualitative study was executed to understand how and why  \\textit{Animal Crossing} has had sustained success over a year after it launched. More specifically, data was collected via a survey focusing on gameplay features and player experience, including the interactions with the NPCs known as villagers in the game. This data was fit into a regression model, and it was concluded that while the villagers do play an important role in the retention of players, it is not the most significant gameplay factor; other factors such as frequent content updates and adding new items to collect also influenced retention. These preliminary results help us to better understand the retention strategies at play in a popular game, thereby providing lessons for future single player games to develop better retention strategies.",

      "abstract": "Overuse of mobile phones pre-sleep is one of the main factors that cause sleep disorders. Although medical research proves that excessive blue light from the smartphone leads to a decrease in sleepiness, the widespread use of cell phones makes it difficult for people to disconnect from them entirely before bedtime. Regarding this dilemma, we explore the potential of treating mobile phones as sleep helpers. In this paper, we proposed a novel interaction mode and designed a breath-control audio game, which guides mobile users to reduce the use of smartphones and take breathing exercises that improve sleep quality near bedtime based on gamification theory. Our game's metaphor promotes smartphone users to beware that excessive use of mobile phones before bedtime will adversely affect sleep, demonstrating the opportunities of utilizing smartphones to support sound sleep. Finally, through our practice, we show that gamification is a potential method to cultivate healthy habits and can be generalized to the formation of other ones in the future.",

We hypothesize that through a dedicated focus on Sense of Embodiment (SoE) using the immersive qualities of consumer Virtual Reality (VR), we can place the participant in historically relevant settings and provide an authentic learning experience that is generally only available locally and synchronously.  In this study, we apply the fundamentals of digital game design and development, the immersive qualities and philosophies of consumer VR, and the Embodied Pedagogical Mediation (EPM) of current teachers and scholars in the traditional Odissi dance form.",

However, most often, it requires users to  fill out a questionnaire, preventing an automated adaptation of the interactive system. For this reason, we explored the potential of using mobile banking data to automate the profiling of Hexad user types. In our study, we conducted an expert consensus study to research whether a group of experts (N=11) in the field of gamification and banking perceive there is a relation between the Hexad user types and banking data. The results show that experts find this relation present, indicating that automating the calculation of Hexad user types from banking data could be feasible.",

Although breaking the fourth wall is a well-known stylistic element, it is still unclear how to utilize it to enhance the game experience. Researchers assume that the effects of fourth wall breaks on players depend on the situation they occur. Therefore, we investigated whether the timing of fourth wall breaks affects players' immersion and game experience. In our game called \"The Door\", 24 participants either experienced a fourth wall break in the beginning, the middle or at the end of the game. We found that the timing of a fourth wall break had a significant effect on players' immersion and perceived competence. We discuss potential explanations for the effects referring to games known for their fourth wall breaks.",

      "abstract": "Esports athletes often reduce visual quality to improve latency and frame rate, and increase their in-game performance. Little research has examined the effects of this visuo-spatial tradeoff on performance, but we could find no work studying how players manage this tradeoff in practice. This paper is an initial examination of this question in the game Dota 2. First, we gather the game configuration data of Dota 2 players in a small survey. We learn that players do limit visual detail, particularly by turning off VSYNC, which removes rendering/display synchronization delay but permits visual “tearing”. Second, we survey the intent of those same players with a few subjective questions. Player intent matches configuration practice. While our sampling of Dota 2 players may not be representative, our survey does reveal suggestive trends that lay the groundwork for future, more rigorous and larger surveys. Such surveys can help new players adapt to the game more quickly, encourage researchers to investigate the relative importance of temporal and visual detail, and justify design effort by developers in \"low visual\" game configurations.",

      "abstract": "Engaging with urban sustainability requires not only changes in individual behavior, but also a collaborative process of decision making together with local constituents. In this paper, we argue for integrating principles of behavior change and gamification with urban participation strategies, to achieve long-term engagement of citizens. We present Smart Citizen, an app we designed by following a gradual process of engaging citizens through setting defaults, triggers and incentives, encouraging reflexivity, active participation and co-production. We evaluated Smart Citizen with 31 users who tested it for two weeks and found a positive attitude towards being more active and acting sustainably locally. Especially users who would be interested in the topic of sustainability but need more tools to establish behaviors had a positive attitude towards using Smart Citizen long-term.",

      "abstract": "In many athletic activities, jumping is a fundamental skill requiring strength, stability, and coordination. It is also a good indicator for general fitness and can predict the individual risk of injury. Therefore, most people profit from training to improve their jumping performance. However, amateur athletes might not have access to professional analysis equipment or jump trainers, and unsupervised training, such as online videos, cannot provide individual feedback. Therefore, we explore the potential of using virtual reality as a widely available platform for a personalized jump training application. Based on the current state of research, we discuss and identify possible use cases, such as instant replays of recorded jumps, an individual motion analysis, automatic exercise recommendations, and gamified workouts. We also demonstrate the feasibility of jumping interaction in virtual scenarios with an early prototype and explain future research directions. ",

      "abstract": "One of the reasons why patients lose focus and interest in physiotherapy exercises is their repetitive nature. Frequently used techniques when trying to promote user engagement and motivation are the gamification of tasks and use of serious games. This paper conceptualizes a framework model to support the design of serious games for children with special needs and a computational platform that implements this concept. The model includes the definition of games based on levels and sequences of actions. The actions model therapeutic exercises. The platform allows the creation of game actions applicable for specific therapies. The setting of the game action scope, in relation to the intended therapies, allows the system to suggest specific actions, based on the patient profile and current needs. The platform allows for later viewing and analysis of recorded results and a comparative analysis of patients' usage data and results is possible. Moreover, data and results can be shared and compared between clinics that use the platform. The paper ends with the presentation of a study based on a game designed following the platform model and being connected to it. ",

      "abstract": "Effectance---the basic positive experience of causing effects---provides a promising explanation for the enjoyment derived from novel low-challenge game genres featuring ample `juicy' feedback. To date, game researchers have studied effectance using a little-validated 11-item scale developed by Klimmt, Hartmann, and Frey. To test its dimensionality and discriminant validity, we conducted an online survey (n = 467) asking people to report on effectance and related experiences in a recent play session. Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses show poor fit with a unidimensional factor structure and poor discriminant validity with common enjoyment and mastery/competence measures, likely due to reverse-coded items and a separable input lag factor. We discuss further possible validity issues like questionable content validity, advise against using the scale in its present form, and close with recommendations for future scale development and use.",
