      "abstract": "Sleep hygiene is a recommendation to help improve sleep quality; many persuasive technologies have been designed in human–computer interaction (HCI) studies to support sleep hygiene routines. However, a critical challenge is that users intentionally do not follow the recommendations because these often conflict with the user’s preferences or circumstances. To overcome this problem, we propose an alternative interaction strategy by which users can negotiate their sleep hygiene activities. Instead of emphasizing idealized rules for users, goals mutually agreed between the user and the system may support adherence to sleep hygiene. To explore the potential and experience of negotiating sleep hygiene goals, users and design researchers engaged in improvisational role-playing to simulate negotiations. We found that negotiation could support positive attitudes and self-efficacy in adhering to sleep hygiene practices. We discuss the balance between flexibility and authority as the primary characteristics of negotiation, and how to design negotiation-based interactive systems.",

      "abstract": "Interactions about climate change have been mostly focused on a negative or neutral form of communication, in line with the so-called “doom-and-gloom” narrative. However, recent research and guidelines point to the need to engage audiences in a more positive, story-focused and actionable way. In this pictorial, we describe a Data Humanism design approach formulated from its original manifesto. We present this proposal through a prototype that engages users with climate change data related to the oceans in a contextualised, personalised and action-focused way. To create this approach, we operationalised data humanism into design steps that guided the design process. Through the analysis of the applied study, we identify opportunities and challenges faced with this approach and with engaging diverse audiences “in the wild” with climate issues, guiding the design of future data humanism climate narratives through interactive data visualisations.",

      "abstract": "Integrating microorganisms into artefacts is a growing area of interest for HCI designers. However, the time, resources, and knowledge required to understand complex microbial behaviour limits designers from creatively exploring temporal expressions in living artefacts, i.e., living aesthetics. Bridging biodesign and computer graphics, we developed FlavoMetrics, an interactive digital tool that supports biodesigners in exploring Flavobacteria’s living aesthetics. This open-source tool enables designers to virtually inoculate bacteria and manipulate stimuli to tune Flavobacteria’s living colour in a digital environment. Six biodesigners evaluated the tool and reflected on its implications for their practices, for example, in (1) understanding spatio-temporal qualities of microorganisms beyond 2D, (2) biodesign education, and (3) the experience prototyping of living artefacts. With FlavoMetrics, we hope to inspire novel HCI tools for accessible and time- and resource-efficient biodesign as well as for better alignment with divergent microbial temporalities in living with living artefacts.",

      "abstract": "A woven textile-form is a form that is constructed simultaneously as the textile is woven. Interfaces designed with this approach hold undisclosed potential for rich interactions. However, the design of woven textile-form interfaces requires specialised tacit knowledge, which is limited even in craft and practice spaces; and it is therefore inaccessible to HCI designers. To bridge this gap, we present the material-driven journey of a multidisciplinary team to design a woven textile-form interface using various techniques such as paper models and diagrams to design for multi-layer weaving. Replacing traditional yarns with conductive yarn, we achieved woven textile-forms with electronic sensing capabilities. By outlining our process, the pictorial highlights the challenges and opportunities of textile-form thinking for HCI designers. Additionally, its printed version serves as a ‘paper prototyping tool’ for designers to gain hands-on experience developing textile-form interfaces.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we explore temporal and technological conjunctures of community-based design responsiveness based upon our experiences of making an interactive digital story map amid housing crises. Through reflexive ethnographic work with the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, we trace three intertwined genres of temporality in our community-based design process: slow design with care; rapid design in response to the urgency of crises; and disruptive design that seeps in from Silicon Valley, proving to \"move fast and break things.\" We assess temporal tensions and contradictions in an evolving data landscape by examining struggles over our pace of practice, time-based media lifecycles, and tooling trade-offs. Theorizing community-based design dilemmas, we contemplate ways of mindfully designing with time, making the past present via digital storytelling, and reimagining technological relations over time.",

      "abstract": "Data-driven news articles are widely used to communicate societal phenomena with concrete evidence. These articles are often accompanied by a visualization, helping readers to contextualize content. However, blind and low vision (BLV) individuals have limited access to visualizations, hindering a deep understanding of data. We explore the possibility of dynamically generating data facts (texts describing data patterns in a chart) for BLV individuals based on their preferences to aid the reading of such articles. We conduct a formative study to understand how they perceive system-generated data facts and the factors influencing their preferences. The results indicate the preferences are highly varied among individuals, and a simple preference elicitation alone induces noise. Based on the findings, we developed a method to personalize the data facts generation using an active learning approach. The evaluation studies demonstrate that our model converges effectively and provides more preferable sets of data facts than the baseline.",

However, there is limited research on how technology supports people with dementia to initiate and engage in music-supported dance exercises at home. We present Switch2Move: a TV-based home system with a tangible interface to trigger music-supported exercises at home for people with dementia. Four people with dementia and their informal caregivers explored a mockup to reveal design improvements for stimulating initiative and engagement. Next, we evaluated a high-fidelity prototype in the homes of three other couples during a one-week pilot study. The Switch2Move home system stimulated initiative by providing ongoing access in the home setting and supported engagement through daily enjoyment, calmness, and relief. We present opportunities for technology to increase self-efficacy, offer rich experiences, and fit the physical and social home environment of people with dementia.",

However, there is a need for more understanding on how to design for these properties of mind. To address this, we present the design of Areca, an air purifier that keeps a diary. This paper outlines our design process, focusing on how the diary generation process gives Areca properties of mind and how its appearance and interaction design support this concept. Through exhibiting Areca in a design exhibition, we gathered people’s initial reactions and perceptions to further evaluate the effectiveness of our design intentions. Finally, based on these experiences, we engage in discussions on the design of products having minds.",

      "abstract": "About half a billion households are expected to use smart home systems by 2025. Although many IoT sensors, such as smoke detectors or security cameras, are available and governmental crisis warning systems are in place, little is known about how to warn appropriately in smart home environments. We created a Raspberry Pi based prototype with a speaker, a display, and a connected smart light bulb. Together with a focus group, we developed a taxonomy for warning messages in smart home environments, dividing them into five classes with different stimuli. We evaluated the taxonomy using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) in a field study at participants' (N = 13) homes testing 331 warnings. The results show that taxonomy-based warning stimuli are perceived to be appropriate and participants could imagine using such a warning system. We propose a deeper integration of warning capabilities into smart home environments to enhance the safety of citizens.",

      "abstract": "Although a picture, GIF, or tutorial video is \"worth a thousand words\", every viewer has a unique perspective of which words they ‘see.’ Packed with rich meaning, these words, or descriptions, are often used to describe the ambiguity of working with materials, artifacts, and processes in creative practices. Our work reframes the traditional crowdsourced description tasks to leverage crowdworker diversity in generating a corpus of tacit descriptions. These descriptions are synthesized into a typology and describe how users communicate ambiguity and tacit knowledge embedded in unfamiliar material properties and familiar handed motions. We propose three design concepts that demonstrate how tacit descriptions could enhance the interpretation of tutorial artifacts - Tacit Layer, or breadth-first interpretation, Tacit Space, or depth-first interpretation, and Tacit Localizer, or context-based interpretation. These concepts are then translated into physical card-sort activities and used in a workshop to gauge how participants consider tacit information in their respective practices.",

      "abstract": "Pastoralists in Somaliland are suffering the impacts of climate change, and need relevant, timely, and practical information about water resources and pastures. However, these communities are sparsely distributed and distant from decision-making centres, which impedes rapid dissemination of climate-related information that could allow them to build resilience to climate impacts. Although smartphone adoption rates are low, mobile services are widespread across Somaliland, presenting opportunities for supporting communities through mobile technologies. We interviewed 30 Somali pastoralists to understand their climate information needs, access to technology, and the potential for technology support. We also conducted a focus group with four Somali development experts to explore the cultural context and possible impacts of different design choices. Our results highlight and explore tensions around different design directions, and suggest possible ways to mitigate these. Designing systems that navigate such considerations can contribute to much-needed climate resilience for pastoralist communities in Somaliland and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Traditional clothing is commonly worn in India and are visual markers of caste, religion, region, political affiliation, and gender. While family, friends, and communities implicitly monitor what is worn, it causes tensions between personal choices of self-expression and social expectations of conformity. This paper describes a speculative design project that explores clothing taboos and possible futures in private, public, and regional/national contexts. We describe a participatory workshop conducted to facilitate reflection about the clothing choices people make today, and to re-imagine the purpose of clothing in the future. The result was the design of a dystopian speculative world called Oneness exhibited in a series of photographs depicting provocative transformations in private, public, and regional/national life. The exhibition became a catalyst for deeper reflections and insights and we suggest speculative techniques could be used more often to create supportive spaces for discussions around culturally sensitive and taboo topics.

      "abstract": "Crowdsourced investigations shore up democratic institutions by debunking misinformation and uncovering human rights abuses. However, current crowdsourcing approaches rely on simplistic collaborative or competitive models and lack technological support, limiting their collective impact. Prior research has shown that blending elements of competition and collaboration can lead to greater performance and creativity, but crowdsourced investigations pose unique analytical and ethical challenges. In this paper, we employed a four-month-long Research through Design process to design and evaluate a novel interaction style called collaborative capture the flag competitions (CoCTFs). We instantiated this interaction style through CoSINT, a platform that enables a trained crowd to work with professional investigators to identify and investigate social media misinformation. Our mixed-methods evaluation showed that CoSINT leverages the complementary strengths of competition and collaboration, allowing a crowd to quickly identify and debunk misinformation. We also highlight tensions between competition versus collaboration and discuss implications for the design of crowdsourced investigations.",

      "abstract": "Research on Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) design highlights that materiality plays an important role in DMI design and musical interaction. However, DMI design research often focuses on technology-oriented factors, with less exploration of the meaning of materials in design practice. In this paper, we explore how DMI designers understand deformable sensor materials and how they use these as a resource for creative aesthetic design. Eleven DMI designers were invited to use a selection of deformable sensor materials to create prototype DMIs with them in a design activity. Three design approaches emerged, determined by how designers perceived and explored sensor materials. We discuss the potential of the methodology for exploring strongly entangled elements, such as material, gesture, and sound, in DMI design. The results contribute to the design practice for DMI designers and to further exploration of material-based design research in Human-Computer Interaction. ",

      "abstract": "Movement-based design methods are increasingly adopted to help design rich embodied experiences. While there are well-known methods in the field, there is no systematic overview to help designers choose among them, adapt them, or create their own. We collected 41 methods used by movement design researchers and employed a practice-based, bottom-up approach to analyze and characterize their properties. We found 17 categories and arranged them into five main groups: Design Resources, Activities, Delivery, Framing, and Context. In this paper, we describe these groups in general and then focus on Design Resources containing the categories of Movement, Space, and Objects. We ground the characterization with examples from empirical material provided by the design researchers and references to previous work. Additionally, we share recommendations and action points to bring these into practice. This work can help novice and seasoned design researchers who want to employ movement-based design methods in their practice.",

      "abstract": "Hybrid learning modalities, where learners can attend a course in-person or remotely, have gained particular significance in post-pandemic educational settings. In introductory programming courses, novices' learning behaviour in the collaborative context of classrooms differs in hybrid mode from that of a traditional setting. Reflections from conducting an introductory programming course in hybrid mode led us to recognise the need for re-designing programming tools to support students' collaborative learning practices. We conducted a participatory design study with nine students, directly engaging them in design to understand their interaction needs in hybrid pedagogical setups to enable effective collaboration during learning. Our findings first highlighted the difficulties that learners face in hybrid modes. The results then revealed learners' preferences for design functionalities to enable collective notions, communication, autonomy, and regulation. Based on our findings, we discuss design principles and implications to inform the future design of collaborative programming environments for hybrid modes.",

      "abstract": "Reporting on the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) ecosystem overwhelmingly focuses on the community that drove its growth and price volatility, gaining widespread media attention in 2021. This overlooks the communities developing novel creative practices on NFT platforms. Interviews with 16 creatives utilizing NFTs reveal a vast Art World: networks of distinct communities maturing into cooperative ecosystems with unique artistic subcultures, philosophies, and interactions. We observe unique qualities of these decentralized distribution platforms and identify patterns of activity comparable to those of traditional art worlds. We identify how aspects of these systems might subvert, or replicate, existing systems of power, value, and access. The impacts of policy and platform design on online creative communities in the NFT Art World carry valuable lessons for developers of digital interventions into the creative industry, exemplifying pertinent considerations for the future of creative labor and cooperation online.\r\n\r\n",

      "abstract": "Technology is becoming increasingly embedded within our material worlds, resulting in an exponential rise in the production and consumption of consumer electronics. Rapid innovations in technological systems reduce technology lifecycles, deprecating digital systems, rendering devices obsolete or incompatible with supporting infrastructure, resulting in the generation of electronic waste (e-waste). Sustainable unmaking practices are a promising avenue for harnessing and repurposing resources used in technology production, enabling us to move closer towards sustainable technology design. This paper presents an applied study investigating the pragmatics of sustainable unmaking, reporting on 12 semi-structured interviews conducted with domain experts engaged in unmaking with e-waste across diverse contexts in the consumer technology lifecycle. We present folk strategies — from rich first-hand accounts, revealing real, vivid, and current perspectives, as well as motivations, passions, and frustrations, of engaging with unmaking e-waste. These strategies inform five declarations as actionable provocations for unmaking in the HCI and design communities.",

      "abstract": "This pictorial outlines findings from a field study part of an inclusive digital storytelling project, which aims to develop digital tools for migrant communities to share their lived cultural heritage (CH). The field study intended to discern migrants' perceptions of cultural heritage through a one-week story-based photo challenge involving ten young adult migrants in Lisbon, Portugal. We analysed the data highlighting participant values and heritage meaning-making. We highlight the unfolding of cultural heritage thematics through their daily journeys in the hosting country's landscapes. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) strives to secure an inclusive and socially just impact for technology. With a focus on participants' assets and values, results from this study point towards sensitising concepts contributing to facilitating the design of inclusive digital tools for telling of lived cultural heritage experiences of migrant communities.

      "abstract": "Microbes offer designers opportunities to endow artefacts with environmental sensing and adapting abilities, and unique expressions. However, microbe-embedded artefacts present a challenge of temporal dissonance, reflected by a “time lag” typically experienced by humans in noticing the gradual and minute shifts in microbial metabolism. This could compromise fluency of interactions and may hinder timely noticing and attending to microbes in living artefacts. In addressing this challenge, we introduce Cyano-chromic Interface, in which photosynthetic activity of cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is timely surfaced by an electrochromic (EC) material through its monochromatic display. Grounded through interface performance characterization and design primitives, we developed application concepts through which we instantiate how the interface can be tuned for diverse functional and experiential outcomes in living artefacts. We further discuss the potential of aligning human-microbe temporalities for enriched interactions and reciprocal relationships with microbes, and beyond.",

      "abstract": "With the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in real-world traffic, there are several human-computer interactions (HCI) challenges—especially how a passenger might interact with an AV where the human driver is absent. Riding inside an AV could be more challenging for older adults who are expected to be one of the largest user cohorts of AV. In this work, we conducted an interview session with senior participants (N=10) which allowed us to identify specific design needs for elderly passengers to have reliable communication with AVs. Based on the findings, we implemented five proof-of-concept prototypes in virtual reality (VR) and evaluated them through a user study with another group of elderly participants (N=15). Informed by the outcome, we discuss design insights for implementing inclusive interfaces inside the AVs that will be supportive of the functional abilities and cognitive needs of older adults to increase psychological driving comfort and perceived safety.",

As a familiar wearable device, headphones offer a compelling site for head-situated interaction and sensing. Using emerging sensing modalities such as inertial motion, capacitive touch sensing, and depth cameras, our implemented prototypes explore sensing and interaction techniques that offer a range of compelling capabilities. \r\n\r\nUser scenarios include context-aware privacy, gestural audio-visual control, and co-opting natural body language as context to drive animated avatars for \"camera-off\" scenarios in remote work--or to co-opt (oft-subconscious) head movements such as dodging attacks in video games to enhance the gameplay experience.\r\n\r\nDrawing from literature and other frameworks, we situate our prototypes and related techniques in a design space across the dual dimensions of (1) type of input (touch, mid-air, or head orientation); and (2) the context of user action (application, body, or environment). In particular, interactions that combine multiple inputs and contexts at the same time offer a rich design space of headphone-situated wearable interactions and sensing techniques.  ",

      "abstract": "Entering a cognitive state of flow is a natural response of the mind that allows people to fully concentrate and cope with tedious, and often repetitive tasks. Understanding how to trigger or sustain flow remains limited by retrospective surveys, presenting a need to better document flow. Through a validation study, we first establish braidmaking as a flow-inducing task. We then study how braidmaking can be used to unpack the experience of flow on a moment-by-moment basis. Using an instrumented Kumihimo braidmaking tool and off-the-shelf biosignal wristbands, we record the experiences of 24 users engaged in 3 different braidmaking tasks. Feature vectors motivated from flow literature were extracted from activity data (IMU, EMG, EDA, heart rate, skin temperature, braiding telemetry) and annotated with Flow Short Scale (FSS) scores. Together, this dataset and data-capture system form the first open-access and holistic platform for mining flow data and synthesizing flow-aware design principles.",

      "abstract": "We present FlexTure, a method for creating pop-up kirigami structures with a selectively bonded bilayer. These surfaces enable a new design space for accessible and rapid prototyping of dynamic surfaces. Using a flexible material selectively attached to a stretched substrate, we can create metamaterial surfaces that change texture. The tactile and aesthetic effects of these surfaces can be tuned through the configuration of cuts in the top layer of material, as well as the selection of the layers themselves. We provide a design workflow and accessible methods to achieve target effects and experimentally measure some mechanical properties of the surfaces. Several application concepts are offered along with a computational design tool. ",

The images data conjure up, however, tend to be homogenous and flat: black screens, ones and zeros, big server farms in the desert. For designers and researchers who work with data as a material, this small repertoire can be stifling. For device users, it can lead to a removal of agency in how they make sense and engage with the data they produce. In this pictorial, we draw from a two-year data fictionalization project to start building an expanded repertoire of data imaginaries. We worked with seven households and seven writers to transform smart home data sets into fiction stories. Based on the interviews we conducted, we present the images participants shared with us as a step towards more expressive and varied imaginaries of data.",

      "abstract": "When commissioning visual art, clients and artists communicate to agree on what is to be created. This often requires bridging a language gap in how they conceive art. To arrive at a mutual understanding, they leverage boundary objects---organized language and artifact instances. However, building and working with such objects is hard due to their innate subjectivity and ambiguity. Moreover, acquiring artifact instances, such as references and sketches, requires effort. We introduce Artinter, an AI-powered commission-support system for sharing, concretizing, and expanding boundary objects. Artinter helps artists and clients develop a mutually understood `language' by allowing them to define concepts with artifacts (e.g., what they mean by `happy’). The system provides two AI-powered approaches for expanding commission boundary objects: 1) guided search with user-defined concepts and 2) instance generation by mixing concepts and artifacts. Our studies identify how AI features can support commissions and reveal future directions for AI-powered collaborative art-making.",

      "abstract": "Envisioning alternative futures and desirable worlds is a core element of design that must be cultivated, especially when a deep transition of practices, values, and power is necessary for vibrant and just future lifeworlds. In this paper, we contribute towards fabulation as an approach for design futuring that foregrounds feminist commitments and more-than-human concerns. Analyzing two fabulation case studies around biodata and bodily fluids, we offer three themes based on our process of developing these fabulations: how they engage materials, how they work to trouble temporalities, and how they cultivate imagination. We argue for the emerging potential of fabulation as an approach for open-ended, joyful design futuring, mobilizing speculative storytelling to foreground absent or neglected relations when imagining alternative lifeworlds.",

Pivoting towards regulations against such practices, we address this gap by offering novel insights into the types of dark patterns deployed in SNSs and people's ability to recognise them across four widely used mobile SNS applications. Following a cognitive walkthrough, experts (N=6) could identify instances of dark patterns in all four SNSs, including co-occurrences. Based on the results, we designed a novel rating procedure for evaluating the malice of interfaces. Our evaluation shows that regular users (N=193) could differentiate between interfaces featuring dark patterns and those without. Such rating procedures could support policymakers' current moves to regulate deceptive and manipulative designs in online interfaces.",

      "abstract": "Screenshots are ubiquitous in mobile computing, yet poorly understood. This paper advances our understanding of reasons for capturing, storing, and sharing screenshots. A crowdsourced user study was conducted where 52 participants shared personal screenshots from their phones, alongside textual reasons for why they were captured. Using mixed methods analyses we uncover common and uncommon screenshot practices that have not previously been documented. By analyzing the language used to describe reasons for taking screenshots, we document a variety of motivations for screenshot captures that provide opportunities for design. We furthermore report nine overarching themes in contemporary mobile screenshot use, considerably extending the currently held view of screenshots as a type of social computing. To inform design, we propose novel screenshot-centered interaction concepts that bridge the empirical findings. Last, we position screenshotting as a style of mobile interaction, which we argue is an undeveloped opportunity for advancing interactivity for mobile computing.",

      "abstract": "The increasing adoption of smart devices in the home introduce new security implications for tenants, with previous research showing the significance of where the devices are placed. This paper examines the relationship between device location and security: we ask how users’ security concerns shape where they place their smart devices and how they attempt to mitigate their concerns. The research focuses on an underrepresented group, those people living in social (low-rent) housing, motivated by the growing interest of housing providers to install smart devices within tenants’ homes. Using speculative design as a probe followed by interviews with eleven tenants, we find that security concerns are centred around ‘intimate places’, ‘social responsibility’ and ‘surveillance’ with users combining social practices and technical security features to mitigate these. Our research contributes new ethical implications for deploying and designing smart home devices addressed to social housing providers and smart device designers. ",

      "abstract": "Local civic participation is essential to democracy. Yet, citizens need to be informed about local matters to get involved. Becoming and staying informed about developments in one's neighbourhood is difficult as local knowledge is scattered among online and offline sources, hard to find and understand. Using participatory Contextual Design we curated a novel form of participation with the interactive artifact \"hubbel\", which combines the digital and the analogue through a hybrid letterbox to crowd-source local knowledge. During our two-month in-the-wild evaluation, the hubbel was heavily used (260 postcards, 2067 visits). It stimulated democratic discourse and (offline) political participation by rendering tacit local issues visible. We propose ways to improve the hubbel's design so that citizens can more easily share their expertise with others and to avoid harmful consequences like pseudo-participation. Finally, the hubbel demonstrates why analogue components are indispensable for civic participation tools. Supplements and open-source code: https://osf.io/jcgue/",

      "abstract": "The ecology of thermoplastic materials is rapidly evolving, enabling an exciting landscape of functional, aesthetic, and interactive forms. Despite their utility in fused filament fabrication (FFF), an even larger and untapped design space exists for thermoplastics. In this work, we introduce a design method that leverages similarities with a more mature medium (glass) to guide a material-centered exploration of a new medium (thermoplastics). Through a collaboration between domain experts in thermoplastics and glass, we synthesized an ontology of kilnforming techniques and developed an annotated portfolio of thermoplastic kilnforms that capture generative design directions for altering the phenomenological qualities of plastic, prototyping metamaterials, and composite forms, and engaging with other material practices. We discuss how material parallels can continue to expand the role of thermoplastics as a design material and how ontology-driven design can serve as a means of localizing, questioning, and generating material knowledge.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the development of alternative formats for religious rituals, such as Protestant online worship services. However, current design approaches focus on problem-solving, and the resulting online solutions merely imitate the offline status quo. To overcome these limitations, we suggest adopting a provotype approach that allows for a more holistic, open-ended dialogue with those affected. We iteratively developed a first provotype in response to tensions found in observation-based field research, aiming to test whether and how it can trigger productive impulses for exploring future technology-mediated worship services based on existing experiences and perspectives. The resulting God-I-Box exaggerates individuality and allows congregants to act almost like liturgists. An analysis of congregants' and pastors' (online) first encounters with the God-I-Box revealed three reaction modes: spontaneous emotions, reflective coping, and exploratory imagination. We conclude with reflections and recommendations for provocative research and design in this context and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Many cohabiting millennials report dissatisfaction about declining levels of sexual desire. Barriers such as desire discrepancy, lack of communication, changing needs, and habituality interfere with sexual desire and relationship satisfaction. This paper explores whether technology has a role in supporting and increasing sexual desire or developing an understanding of different individual needs towards sexual desire within couples’ relationships and how it can do so. To explore this, we conducted a survey (n=77) and interview study (n=12). Results show that participants wanted a shared, dedicated, and protected space to playfully explore their individual desire with each other. They felt technology could facilitate a better understanding of their evolving needs as a couple, motivate open sexual communication, bring spontaneity, and hands-on exploration; however, technology should not inflict judgment or obligations on desire levels; it should help to understand and situate differing needs in a relationship meaningfully. We share our reflections on the role of technology and raise important considerations in such technology design.",

      "abstract": "On-demand work platforms are attractive alternatives to traditional employment arrangements. However, several questions around employment classification, compensation, data privacy, and equitable outcomes remain open. Fraught regulatory debates are compounded by the abilities of algorithmic management to structure different forms of platform-worker relationships. Understanding the conditions of algorithmic management that result in these variations could point us towards better worker futures. In this work, we studied the platform-worker relationships in Instacart work through the accounts of its workers. From a qualitative analysis of 400 Reddit posts by Instacart's workers, we identified sources of ambiguity that gave rise to open-ended experiences for workers. Ambiguities supplemented gamification mechanisms to regulate worker behaviors. Yet, they also generated positive affective experiences for workers and enabled their playful participation in the Reddit community. We propose the frame of ludification to explain these seemingly contradicting findings and conclude with implications for accountability in on-demand work platforms. ",

Some communities have adopted chatbots in addition to SMEs to address commonly asked questions. Yet, SME-bot interactions, particularly teaching paradigms between SMEs and bots remain understudied. We investigate human-AI machine teaching interactions in a scenario-based study (n=48). Participants selected their preferred teaching method in simulated community interactions with a consumer, an SME, and an AI Bot. We investigated preferences across three interactions: demonstration (Showing), preference elicitation (Sorting), and labeling (Categorization). Participants preferred the Showing interaction, followed by Sorting and Categorizing. Participants changed their preferences from lower-effort interactions when considering downstream outcomes. Users considered the community’s perception of interactions between the bot and the SME, specifically transparency of learning outcome, orientation of the feedback, querying the bot and disruptiveness of the interaction. We discuss implications for our findings for teaching interactions in human-AI communities.",

Privacy is becoming a fluid regulatory process the values and expectations of which are being actively rewritten, deconstructed, reconstructed and negotiated as new technologies open up novel forms of social relations and identity construction opportunities. Our proposal is based on using our bodies as tools for identity expression and personal proclamation, seeking to pervert surveillance and its embodied data as a site for opportunity, disruption and resistance. We asked XXX, a writer and journalist, to work with us on a design exploration, to understand new implications of what being an “influencer” means by shaping identities through technologies in an extreme way. After analyzing some of the most commonly employed surveillance technologies worldwide and the main biometric parameters used to monitor the human body, we came up with a series of prostheses and garments in order to exploit XXX’s algorithmic presence. \r\n",

Following a Research Through Design (RTD) approach, we recruited 6 designers to create design proposals with AI. They were invited to collect case studies, make annotated portfolios, collaborate with the generator for design ideation, and undergo semi-structured interviews. Through this process, we gathered empirical data to investigate how designers ideate with AI and what opportunities and challenges emerge in the collaboration. The results showed that the combination of human and AI input in the design process contribute to a fresh form of self-expression and communication. AI was found to bring a distinct perspective that opens up new avenues for artistic expression. The research highlights the potential of AI to augment human creativity and the need for ongoing exploration in this field.",

In this pictorial, we propose a collaborative role for AI to prompt self-reflection. We explore this through a practice-based inquiry of whether and how AI could help a designer reflect on and relate to their own work. Three designers annotate a collection of images representing their fascinations, with subjective labels, indicating different dimensions of their visual concepts. These labels are used to teach an object detection model the designers’ perspectives. Then, they used this trained model on their own design work to evaluate the AI’s potential to prompt self-reflection. By describing this process of AI-training we explore how an AI can help us become aware of our own implicit perspectives.\r\n",

This study investigates how generative machine learning and large language models may play a part in creative design processes of ideation, early prototyping and sketching. A workshop was conducted in which design practitioners and design researchers developed design concepts for a provided design case, with the help of GPT-3. The findings point to three main themes, including i) the practical usefulness and limitations of the system in design ideation processes, ii) how the form of user interaction shapes users' expectations of the system's capabilities and potentials, and iii), how the broader discourse around AI both limits and enables how co-creative processes involving human and AI unfolds. The discussion outlines design implications and alternative framings of this kind of co-creative design practices based on post-human perspectives on design and technology use.  ",

To understand the current state and reflect on the future of goal setting in personal informatics, we report the results of a scoping review of 51 papers that use and provide design implications for implementing goal setting. Our review highlights six implications for using goal setting in personal informatics tools (clarity, transparency, flexibility, framing and reframing, personalization, and reflection). We find that goal setting is becoming increasingly complex as the number of goals and their characteristics increase. We discuss these insights and point towards the importance of supporting self-efficacy during goal setting, showing adaptive goal evolution over time, reducing burden during goal setting, and framing goals to understand the complexity of health goals and support a holistic view on goal setting.",

      "abstract": "From an engineering perspective, sensors provide measurements of phenomena in the world. Sensor data might be noisy, biased or otherwise subject to error, and these labels presuppose the existence of an objective ground truth the sensor is intended to approximate. This paper explores an alternative look at sensor signals as situated observations entangled with the systems they seek to measure, where meaning can be carried in qualitative particulars rather than quantitative and statistical analyses. Karen Barad’s `agential realism' \\cite{baradMeetingUniverseHalfway2007} and Graham Harman’s `tool-being' \\cite{harmanToolbeingHeideggerMetaphyics2002} inform our approach to understanding \\emph{together with} the sensors, which become co-investigators and co-creators of the subsequent knowledge. We illustrate our collaborative effort with the sensor through a case study where we examine sensor signals from a device designed to query the experience of woodcarving by making the experience unfamiliar. We seek a qualitative approach to knowledge (co-)creation with sensor data from a more-than-human perspective.",

      "abstract": "UX practitioners (UXPs) face novel challenges when working with and communicating artificial intelligence (AI) as a design material. We explore how UXPs communicate AI concepts when given hands-on experience training and experimenting with AI models. To do so, we conducted a task-based design study with 27 UXPs in which they prototyped and created a design presentation for an AI-enabled interface while having access to a simple AI model training tool. Through analyzing UXPs' design presentations and post-activity interviews, we found that although UXPs struggled to clearly communicate some AI concepts, tinkering with AI broadened common ground when communicating with technical stakeholders. UXPs also identified key risks and benefits of AI in their designs, and proposed concrete next steps for both UX and AI work. We conclude with a sensitizing concept and recommendations for design and AI tools to enhance multi-stakeholder communication and collaboration when crafting human-centered AI experiences. ",

      "abstract": "What does it mean to design for a miracle—an ineffable phenomenon that might just exist in the world, but might also transcend it? Focusing on an esoteric strand of Jewish mystical thought known as Kabbalah, we draw from speculative interview activities with 11 Jewish creative interlocutors to describe a process of designing a \"miracle machine.\" Interweaving foundational Kabbalah literature with design inquiry, we find that lived experiences of miracles span life-saving events, effortful acts of love, and ineffable forms of knowledge. We also learn that people envision miracle machines as natural, cosmic, and sensory systems with transcendent capacities. These insights rework a normative focus on the human mind (cognition) and body (embodiment) by embracing the all-too-often overlooked soul as a design resource. We end with a reflection on what soulful speculation entails and the purview that it expands, reorienting our understanding of what machines are altogether.",

While such interfaces are becoming more mainstream in vehicles, knowledge of situational and contextual factors which influence user preferences about these interactions is sparse. Through semi-structured interviews with 15 individuals, we take a scenario-specific look at perceptions, expectations, and concerns of voice, gesture, and multimodal interactions within vehicles. We presented participants with scenarios where cognitive load, social norms, and other situational factors vary greatly, such as heavy-traffic or multiple passengers. We found situational preferences of voice and gesture shifted greatly, and often contradicted broadly stated preferences. For example, users generally prefer touch, but use voice in complex traffic, and prefer gesture around other occupants to not interrupt conversations. Based on our findings, we share design considerations that can help interaction designers account for variations in user preference when designing modally flexible automotive interfaces.",

We aimed to uncover if hybrid gifting can facilitate nostalgic experiences through repurposed digital media. In this case, we used a physical chocolate box and a QR code, that when scanned presented nostalgic images and text. Findings from gift exchanges and eighteen semi-structured interviews with givers and receivers are presented through thematic analysis. We reveal the impact on exchanges when nostalgia is evoked, and outline the roles of people, emotions, and objects. The contribution of this work is an understanding of re-purposing our growing digital archives to frame nostalgic memories as gifts.",

Queer utopia, coined by queer theorist Jose Muñoz, is a way of using queer aesthetics and performance to expose heterosexual norms and imagine worlds of hopeful queer alternatives. Through close reading and interpretation of TikTok, we examine content made by rural queer farmers on TikTok and ask how it enacts queer utopias. We show these farmers perform queer identity in rural farming spaces which subverts stereotypes of both who is queer and who can farm, and their videos also enact queer political utopias by connecting farming to social justice and radical sustainability. We explore how TikTok offers a sociotechnical stage where queer rural farmers can perform queer utopias in ways that celebrate creative and generative uses of platforms by queer folks.",

      "abstract": "Sensor networks are increasingly commonplace in visions of smart cities and future healthcare systems, promising greater efficiency and increased wellbeing. However, the design of these technologies remains focused on specific users and fragmented by context, overlooking the diversity of needs, wants and values present when technologies, people, and lived realities interact within instrumented spaces. In this paper we present a workshop method – Sensing Care – that can help researchers, interdisciplinary design and development teams, and potentially affected users, to explore what it takes to design for living with sensor technologies that intersect and interact across private and public spaces, through speculative scenarios and role play. Drawing from three deployments of the workshop, we discuss how this approach supports the design of future care-oriented sensor networks, and helps designers understand what it means to live with complex technologies as people traverse diverse contexts.",

      "abstract": "In response to research concerns that smartphone usage negatively impacts intimate relationships, this paper presents a study exploring how design can encourage smartphone accountability in family home settings. We developed and deployed three provotypes with seven families via a Research through Design study intended to encourage reflections on ubiquitous and routinised smartphone usage. The provotypes progressively explore ways of making smartphone use visible by facilitating individualised accountability, competitive accountability, and collective accountability. We present insights into how these provotypes shaped family practices based on a qualitative study with 26 participants. We found that, by emphasising different forms of shared accountability, the provotypes reduced smartphone use, which in turn fostered family intimacy and togetherness, rooted in meanings of caring and sharing. Finally, we discuss our study's implications for how provotypes can help explore forms of accountability in practices involving sustainable technology use within the home.",

      "abstract": "Connected homes and smart assistants shape the future practices of humans, but they do not yet perfectly fit their needs and processes. Our research explores how smart assistants can effectively support users during cooking. First, we completed an observational study with ten participants to understand their needs for competence and autonomy in relation to their individual cooking. Following the empirical results, we prototyped a multimodal assistant that interactively provides stepwise guidance for a multi-part recipe. We evaluated the prototype in a Wizard-of-Oz approach with ten participants. The classification according to cooking competence and need for autonomy turned out to be an efficient way to understand the different user perspectives on the prototype. We could observe under which conditions users prefer graphical or voice interaction and how proactivity of the assistant affects human agency and derived general insights for the design and co-performance of smart assistants in other domains.",

      "abstract": "HCI projects bringing digital and interactive technologies into art museums are affected by a conception of the relation between art and design that narrows the available design space. This is often done by positioning such technologies either as presenting information about artworks, as artworks themselves, or by taking a 'hands-off' approach. Aiming to re-investigate this conceptual space, we draw on an enactive approach to art developed by Alva Noë and, by means of a design example (an installation in the MUNCH museum), discuss how this approach redirected the design process. Specifically, how it affected the way the design team related to the original artworks and their history, and how they approached evaluating their work. We show by example how understanding such technologies in terms of how they educate visitors' attention, similarly to art critique, allows designers to participate in correspondence with artworks using unique material, aesthetic, and embodied means.

      "abstract": "During past decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been consistently used in Creativity Support Tools (CSTs). Recently, with the development of generative AI models, particularly Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) in Computer Vision, it became possible that AI directly generates visual ideas. However, there were rarely any work in creativity research that harnessed the design ideas generated by such models directly for design space exploration. In this paper, we propose a StyleGAN-driven digital mood board, GANCollage, that integrates AI generated visual ideas into the ideation phase for creativity support. GANCollage supports semantic explorations of StyleGAN generations in an iterative human-in-the-loop manner, using an AI-driven interactive tagging system. Our evaluation involving 10 participants manifests that GANCollage provides more creativity support without compromising the final results. It also offers a more enjoyable, explicit and effective way of exploring AI generated visual ideas for ideation.",

      "abstract": "Contemporary human-food interaction design is often a technology-driven endeavor in which food’s materiality has been largely underexplored. Building on the concept of “computational food”, this paper explores the design of food as a material realization of computation through a material-centered approach. We engaged with a “Research through Design” exploration by designing a computational food system called “Dancing Delicacies”, which enables food items to be “programmed” and “reconfigured” within dynamic trajectories. Our practice led to a design framework resulting in four original dish designs. Our dishes aim to illustrate the richness of this new design space for computational food. Furthermore, through engaging with expert practitioners from the hospitality industry, we provide a first account of understanding the design of computational food for dynamic dining trajectories and its speculative use contexts in the industry. With this work, we hope to inspire researchers and designers to envision a new future of human-food interaction.",

      "abstract": "Role-playing can be an effective method for disability awareness education (DAE), and the immersive nature of virtual reality (VR) holds promise for enhancing DAE experiences. However, existing VR applications for DAE often pay less attention to the social aspects of disabilities, resulting in a lack of ability to simulate implicit social discrimination experienced by individuals with disabilities. To bridge this gap, we developed DiVRsity, a customizable VR group role-playing platform for DAE. To identify design requirements for DiVRsity, we conducted a formative study with VR and DAE experts. In an evaluation study, 28 participants engaged in role-playing exercises using DiVRsity, simulating discriminatory interpersonal situations experienced by individuals with vision impairments. Findings revealed that participants' disability awareness significantly increased after engaging in role-playing activities using DiVRsity compared to before. We discuss the potential of VR as a role-playing platform for DAE and provide design implications for future VR-based DAE tools. ",

While most technologies focus on mindfulness meditation training for novices, in this paper, we explore designing technology to support everyday mindfulness activities for people with varying levels of experience. Through 9 magic machine workshops, 30 mindfulness practitioners explored and reflected on their personal experiences of everyday mindfulness, and generated designs that support their daily practice. Our findings identified six categories of designs conceptualized by our participants: everyday objects, physical spaces, wearables, metaphorical art, companions, and toys. We further analyze the practitioners' thought processes and considerations for designs that support everyday mindfulness, such as eliciting and regulating emotion and associating mindfulness with routine daily activities. Finally, we discuss the implications of designing individualized mindfulness products and the potential of using co-design magic machine workshops to explore a practical design space.",

When older adults adopt and use mobile shopping, social interactions with close others greatly influence their experience. Therefore, this paper aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how social interactions with close others shaped older adults' mobile shopping practices. We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 31 older adults who reported using mobile shopping regularly. We found that older adults engaged in three types of social interaction: learning from, collaborating with, and assisting close others in adopting and using mobile shopping. Through these social interactions, they gradually built trust in mobile shopping systems and supported each other's decision-making processes. In conclusion, we presented design implications for facilitating social interactions to improve older adults' mobile shopping experience.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce Physica, a tangible physics simulation system and approach based on tabletop mobile robots. In Physica, each tabletop robot can physically represent distinct simulated objects that are controlled through an underlying physics simulation, such as gravitational force, molecular movement, and spring force. It aims to bring the benefits of tangible and haptic interaction into explorable physics learning, which was traditionally only available on screen-based interfaces. The system utilizes off-the-shelf mobile robots (Sony Toio) and an open-source physics simulation tool (Teilchen). Built on top of them, we implement the interaction software pipeline that consists of 1) an event detector to reflect tangible interaction by users, and 2) target speed control to minimize the gap between the robot motion and simulated moving objects. To present the potential for physics education, we demonstrate various application scenarios that illustrate different forms of learning using Physica. In our user study, we investigate the effect and the potential of our approach through a perception study and interviews with physics educators.",

      "abstract": "We focus on the stories of five older adults who became voice assistant users through our study, and with whom we speculated about future interfaces through two design probes, one for health data reporting and one for positive reminiscing. We delivered a voice-first ambient interface (VFAI) to each participant, and closely observed participants' journeys through periodic themed interviews (16 hours, 21 minutes of transcribed recordings), usage log reviews (4,657 entries), and phone and text support. Participants' lived experiences impacted their perceptions and interactions with their VFAI, fueling rich insights about how to design for diverse needs. For example, while one participant saw increased potential in the VFAI after interacting with the design probe for health data reporting, another was skeptical of using it to communicate with her doctor. We contribute an in-depth exploration of VFAIs to support aging in place, implications for design, and areas for future work for tailoring VFAIs towards enabling continuity of care in people's homes.",

      "abstract": "Although mid-air hand gestures have been widely adopted by VR/AR products (e.g., Quest 2 and HoloLens), some drawbacks remain due to their lack of tangibility and tactile feedback. Opportunistic Tangible User Interfaces could address these shortcomings by repurposing existing objects in one’s physical environment. However, there has yet to be a systematic investigation of the gestures that would be desirable when using opportunistic objects or how such gestures would be impacted by such objects. In this work, we conducted an elicitation study to investigate the desirability of object and gesture combinations across a variety of interactions. The results contribute (1) an opportunistic tangible UI gesture set for spatial interfaces, and (2) an Affordance-Based Object Selector Scheme that identifies ideal objects for tangible input given a desired input gesture, based on that object’s physical affordances. Arising from these findings is the vision of the Adaptive Tangible User Interface, which supports the on-the-fly composition of tangible interfaces based on the affordances found in the physical environment and a user’s input task.",

      "abstract": "In the 21st century workplace (especially in COVID times), much human social interaction occurs during virtual meetings. Unlike traditional screen-based remote meetings, VR meetings promise a more richly embodied form of communication.  This paper maps the experiential terrain of seven commercial VR meeting applications, with a particular focus on the range of shared social experiences and collaborative abilities these applications may enable or constrain. We examine a range of applications including Spatial, Glue VR, MeetinVR, Mozilla Hubs, VRChat, AltspaceVR, and Rec Room. We analyze and map avatar system strategies, meeting environments and in-world cues, meeting invitation model, and different models of participation. In addition, we argue that commercial applications for meeting in VR that cater to workplace contexts might benefit from borrowing some of the strategies used in more leisure-focused environments for supporting social interaction.",

      "abstract": "The design of digital interventions for mental health often overlooks the foundational belief in one's own self-worth and related ability to develop close relationships with others. Attachment theory explains these interpersonal aspects, which have long been associated with positive mental health outcomes such as resilience when faced with adversity. We report on generative interviews with mentors experienced in supporting youth, as part of design work initiated by community leaders concerned about the traumatic effects of gun violence and systemic racism on local youth. These community leaders wanted to extend their existing mentoring efforts through digital technology. We identified attachment theory as the best fit for helping us understand how mentors are addressing trauma among youth, in ways that can inform how we design in support of these relationships and communities. We introduce attachment-informed design as a set of design principles that represent a novel approach to digital mental health interventions.",

      "abstract": "Creative coders create programs that generate visual output. Frameworks such as p5.js support sketching with creative code. Given the focus on expressivity over functionality, code reuse in creative coding practice is distinct from other programming contexts. Remixing facilitates iteration on existing code, but we have yet to understand how creative coders use remixing in practice. To understand creative coder remixing strategies, we studied the community of OpenProcessing, a site dedicated to sharing code-generated artworks. We found that 30% of the 1.2 million sketches in our data set were involved in remixing. For in-depth insight, we qualitatively analyze source code and visual output of 350 antecedent-remix pairs. We present on the diversity of ways that authors remix to curate projects, annotate process, explore variations, and transform existing sketches. We discuss the prevalence of these types and implications for supporting a multiplicity of remixing strategies in creative work.",

In particular, we focus on sensing vibrations—for their hidden yet omnipresent qualities in domestic environments. We designed the Inner Ear in response and in contrast to a growing collection of ‘always on and recording’ smart home devices. With the Inner Ear, we purposefully let participants choose when to capture vibrations and which capture should be physicalized. In this pictorial, we describe the design and fabrication process of the capturing device as well as the data physicalization workflow. We contribute insights on (1) the design rationale and development of a double function artifact (to both capture and represent), as well as (2) design decisions involved in balancing legibility with leaving room for meaning making during the transcription of home vibration data.\r\n",

      "abstract": "The climate impact of our food consumption is a key issue to sustainability. Yet understanding the food system and the impact it has can be difficult given its abstract nature. In this paper, we report on a Research through Design project aimed at designing and evaluating a data physicalization for supporting collective sense-making of the climate impact of food. Throughout the design process, we have explored the materiality of CO2 emissions and ways to design with less resource use. The resulting data physicalization, Carbon Scales, was evaluated in a three-week field study with 27 participants. Our findings show that collective sense-making can be enabled through interactive data physicalizations and that this can lead to carbon literacy. We expand on a) sustainability through design by arguing for the value of artifacts that let people stay in the interaction as this can support collective sense-making and b) sustainability in design by showcasing the value of designing with an interaction-first and materials-second mindset.",

      "abstract": "This work explores e-textiles in the design space of Human-Vehicle Interaction (HVI) and compares distraction levels between e-textile and screen-based interactions during driving tasks. We developed three prototypes (in the steering wheel, headrest cover, and seat-belt pad) to support tactile interactions (tap, press, and swipe) with car interior elements for non-driving applications (such as media control). Our designs used digital embroidery to achieve aesthetic design qualities and wireless connection. In a deployment study with 16 participants, we collected quantitative and qualitative data through video recording, field observations, and user interviews. The study repeated all scenarios using screen-based interaction for comparison. Our findings present insights into fabric-based sensors including fewer collisions and a 302.7% decrease in eye distraction. These findings suggest new design opportunities, such as retrofitting existing vehicles, designing ideation toolkits for diverse users, devising an e-textile Fitts’ Law for reachability, and expanding vehicle interaction research within the HCI community.",

      "abstract": "The Participant Journey Map (PJM) provides structured insight into participation with interactive play in (semi-)public environments. It supports understanding of participants’ behavior and was developed based on experiences with previously developed playful interfaces, related research and expert interviews. We apply the PJM to interactive playful museum exhibits and evaluate and refine it based on its usage in a situated context. We observed 672 play sessions with 6 interactive playful museum exhibits. The observation data was visualized and analyzed using the PJM. This study shows that the PJM provides a realistic representation of participant behaviour, can be used to identify stagnations and progressions in participation flow, and support identification of influencing design and contextual factors. With this paper we contribute by presenting the PJM as a well-grounded, valuable and realistic framework for evaluating and understanding participation with situated interactive play, based on post-hoc evaluation of multiple interfaces with many users.",

      "abstract": "People with osteoarthritis or other chronic conditions need to adopt and maintain healthy behaviors, such as physical exercises. Current behavior change technologies primarily seek to motivate this through goal setting, self-monitoring, and rewards. Based on Organismic Integration Theory (OIT), we designed Equi as a tangible alternative. Its aim is to “integrate” behavior rather than to externally control it. When behavior becomes integrated, its maintenance is based on self-congruence. Equi facilitates integration by situated reflection, symbolism, and appreciation of values. We conducted a two-week field exploration to gather osteoarthritis patients’ experiences with Equi. We identified specific features and general principles that are conducive to the pursuit of self-congruence, such as ambient visibility, reflection, insight and matching, as well as detrimental ones, such as performance orientation or controlling forces (e.g., reminders, rewards). From a theoretical perspective, OIT offers strategies for designing behavior change technologies that focus on the maintenance of newly acquired behavior.",

Due to their prohibitive cost and limited access, there is limited research within HCI and the rules to design graphics on these low-resolution tactile displays are unclear. In this paper, eight tactile readers with visual impairments qualitatively evaluate the implementation of Pixel Art to create tactile graphical primitives on a pin array display. Every pin of the pin array is assumed to be a pixel on a pixel grid. Our findings suggest that Pixel Art tactile graphics on a pin array are clear and comprehensible to tactile readers, positively confirming its use to design basic tactile shapes and line segments. The guidelines provide a consistent framework to create tactile media which implies that they can be used to downsize basic shapes for refreshable pin-array displays.",

To better understand inclusive theatre practices for technology design, we worked with the first professional inclusive theatre ensemble in Greece, which faced difficulties due to social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic. In this paper, we attempt to better understand inclusion within such theatre practices through the co-designing of a prototype digital system for Touch Tours, an experience through touch service. We conducted a series of research through design activities with the group, building on eighteen months of ethnographic research. Our goal was to develop a service based on their practices.   We contribute design implications for inclusive services, with respect to equity in experience, which enhance the activistic character of the movement, and HCI research concerned with developing technologies that support inclusion.",

Whereas previous HCI design research has tackled problems with waste management from an individual, behavioral change perspective, we approach this design space through a feminist ecological design perspective of Digital Environmental Stewardship. Through a combination of qualitative empirical data and materials generated at design workshops, we outline challenges related to waste management in a complex of five multi-apartment buildings. We propose a number of design explorations addressing such challenges, and reflect on the generative role of the DES framework in framing design from a collective and ecological perspective.",

Given that much of the current interaction design research for VR is conducted in lab-based settings, there is a need for design considerations that engage with the complexities of these real-world spaces. We present an analysis of visual data (e.g., GIFs, videos, photographs) collected from a manual search of Reddit posts that show ``play spaces'' and other home-based contexts of VR. Our findings offer insight into the diverse and dynamic characteristics of VR spaces, with set-ups ranging from bedrooms to garages, and with the people, objects, impediments, and affordances of individual spaces demonstrating a variety of ways that VR is used in the home. We conclude by discussing directions for future interaction design research that seeks to incorporate physical actions and environments while also engaging with the complex realities of domestic VR. \r\n",

In this work, we design a personal informatics technology probe that scaffolds reflection on how time-use satisfies Max-Neef's fundamental needs of being, having, doing, and interacting via self-aspects, relationships and organizations, activities, and environments. Through a combination of a think-aloud study (N=10) and a week-long in situ deployment (N=7), participants used the probe to complete self- aspect elicitation and Day Reconstruction Method tasks. Participants then interacted with network visualizations of their daily lives, and discovered insights about their lives. During the study, we collected a dataset of 662 activities annotated with need satisfaction ratings. Despite challenges in operationalizing a theory of need through direct elicitation from individuals, personal informatics systems show potential as a participatory and individually meaningful approach for understanding need satisfaction in everyday life.",

Extant research in HCI and interaction design suggests leveraging data on photos’ contexts (e.g., time and place) to support photo use by the bereaved. Extending this research, we interviewed 17 bereaved parents to examine how the bereaved might also interact with photos’ content (e.g., color schemes, facial expressions). We characterize their interactions as processes of meaning-making that enabled them to keep their finite photos relevant and maintain continuing bonds with their children. By identifying meaning-making processes in terms of interactions with both photos’ content and contexts, we open up possibilities for supporting photo use for the bereaved that leverage content-related data. Our findings more broadly highlight the importance of accounting for subjective meaning-making processes in data-driven approaches to photo use in HCI and computer vision.",

Our toolkit enables forestry future-making by helping forest goers to pay attention to, reflect on, ideate around, and document their forestry experiences.

In the context of Immersive Sampling, practitioners engage in experiencing immersive environments, while capturing, organizing, revisiting, and remixing found content. We situate this subset of tasks in literature and argue for their importance for emerging, future content creation domains. To further explore how Immersive Sampling might take place, we created VRicolage, a proof-of-concept prototype showcasing a set of interactions in Virtual Reality to sample, revisit, and remix captures. Given the democratization of immersive environments, Immersive Sampling provides practitioners with a means to collect, revisit, and remix digital materials.",

      "abstract": "Recent research has shown that users increasingly seek meaning in technologies and that eudaimonic user experience (UX) is part of everyday encounters with technology. Yet, to date, there is no validated means to assess eudaimonic properties in interactive artefacts. We conceptualised, developed and validated a six-item questionnaire for measuring eudaimonic properties of technologies---the Eudaimonic Technology Experience Scale (ETES). Our scale includes two factors, which describe what aspects of a eudaimonic experience can be supported by technology: eudaimonic goals and self-knowlege. We consulted work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), psychology and philosophy to gather an initial set of concepts that could contribute to eudaimonic UX. We then built the scale based on expert interviews and exploratory factor analysis and verified its quality in a number of tests (confirmatory factor analysis, reliability and validity checks). ETES provides a standardised tool for identifying eudaimonic qualities in interactive systems and allows for rapidly comparing prototypes.",

      "abstract": "We propose a novel, cost-effective soft sensor capable of detecting contact force, multiple touch points, and reflecting sensor interaction in real-time with a 3D virtual surface representation. Our fabrication process has been optimized for cost efficiency through careful material selection, utilization of automated machinery, and low-cost hardware. The sensor can be easily replicated without the need for complex laboratory equipment. The sensor employs trained neural network models for real-time signal translation into localization, force measurement, and deformation mapping. We have also developed an efficient data collection system that captures accurate 2D localization, force measurement, and 3D surface data to generate a high-quality pre-validated data set. This data set is filtered using prior knowledge before being fed to two neural network models. Our interactive prototype demonstrates the stability and accuracy of the low-cost soft sensor, delivering reliable results in both single-point and multi-point contact scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Mastering skills which involve high dexterity, such as playing the piano, requires extensive guidance through personal teaching. Understanding how we can leverage data from sensor-based systems to improve the learning process, allows us to build interactive systems which effectively facilitate skill acquisition. To explore such possibilities, we developed EyePiano - a gaze-assisted tool for reflective piano playing. EyePiano guides the practice process of learning piano scores through analyzing the pianist's gaze behavior. We based the design of EyePiano on requirements identified through interviews with piano teachers and a feasibility evaluation of gaze metrics. Our system illustrates that basic gaze metrics are sufficient to predict difficult regions for students. Thus, highlighting sections of the music piece which are particularly difficult for the pianist allows EyePiano to support piano rehearsals for students. Our work showcases the feasibility of using gaze data for reflective music education, enabling effective instrument practice.",

      "abstract": "Collective stress is the stress within a group or an organization. It affects individuals' well-being and group productivity. HCI research has started exploring collective stress visualization to facilitate group awareness and collective coping via testing prototypes in controlled settings. However, an in-depth understanding of users' needs and envisaged scenarios based on their authentic experiences are still lacking. In this study, we utilized a participatory approach called co-constructing stories to investigate how a collective stress visualization would be used in office workers' authentic workday routines. We constructed use case stories with a group of office workers separately based on their personal lived experiences, using a design probe called AffectiveGarden. Our results categorized six clusters of benefits for collective coping through visualization and their implications for future design practice.",

      "abstract": "The gig economy and digital labor platforms, such as food delivery, have become essential while also troubling the current socioeconomic landscape. Delivery platforms promise entry-level work, flexibility, and other benefits. However, researchers remain divided on if these platforms benefit workers and society at large. This study aims to shed light on the comprehensive challenges in food delivery work, uncovering gig worker-centered design opportunities to improve the lives of food couriers. Adopting an exploratory research process, we analyzed 19 ride-along food delivery videos and performed nine semi-structured interviews with food couriers in Portugal. Our findings illustrated the complexity and challenging nature of delivery work due to the entangled physical, digital, social, natural, and human factors. We captured and discussed gig worker-centered opportunities that surfaced from work challenges, echoing the needs of food couriers about supporting work, justice, inclusion, and work vision.\r\n",

      "abstract": "The current state of Virtual Reality (VR) presents a limited and underwhelming user experience. Users are restricted from naturally walking beyond the physical boundaries of the real world, unable to fully explore large virtual environments. The virtual manifestation also often mirrors the physical features of the real world, neglecting the limitless possibilities of the virtual universe. In response to this limitation, this pictorial introduces Architectural Narrative VR, a generative environment that dynamically designs spaces on-the-fly. This approach enables users to roam freely within the constraints of their physical space, while the architectural proportions and rhythm of virtual spaces are designed to relate to external factors such as the sequential presentation of content and user behaviour. This work contributes to VR research by exploring new ways of generating virtual spaces that prioritise user-dependent rather than predefined manifestations of the architectural narrative, offering greater potential for immersive and multidimensional user experiences.",

      "abstract": "Allowing users of interactive systems to reflect on their task proficiency is often incidental. This is unfortunate, as communicating meaningful task-related proficiency feedback could improve users' awareness of their abilities and their willingness to improve. To highlight the feasibility of this concept, we evaluated how different methods of readability feedback impacted users during a text production task. In general, our results showed that having access to readability feedback allowed participants to reflect on their task solving approach, facilitating the users' understanding of their proficiency. Revision-based methods are less distracting for the user than continuous feedback methods, while still offering high efficacy. Further, feedback should be paired with a subtle form of gamification elements. We envision this reflection-oriented design to user proficiency to be applicable to a variety of interactive systems, allowing for an improved and engaging user experience.",

      "abstract": "Automation transparency – the visibility of responsibilities, capabilities, goals, activities, and effects of autonomous systems – is not only important for the operator, but also relevant for other humans in the system’s environment. This pictorial investigates current trends in the development of External Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) and highlights the most important factors for designing eHMIs. Further, it explores automation transparency for a self-driving passenger ferry for urban waterborne transport and how it can communicate messages about the system’s perceptions, current state and future intention to nearby ships and bystanders through an eHMI. As a result of a user-centred design process, we propose a unique eHMI design making an urban autonomous passenger ferry capable of expressing its state and intention to nearby ships and humans via displays, light, and moving panels. The results of this paper can inform designers of the importance of automation transparency for autonomous waterborne transport systems.",

      "abstract": "The remote communication within intimate groups can be challenging due to lack of or excessive of non-verbal messages, which lack physicality. In this paper, we introduce Stubbi, a device designed to enhance remote text and voice communication in small intimate groups by enabling the exchange of simple physical movements. Each group member is equipped with Stubbi, which consists of three stubs that represent each person and enable the expression of physical movements through height changes and rotation. Our in-lab study involving six groups of three friends revealed that Stubbi effectively maintained the flow of IM conversations by increasing attentiveness and responsiveness. Additionally, in group voice calls, the exchange of personified messages through physical movements of the stubs assisted group interactions, such as turn-taking. Our findings suggest further implications for designing interactive systems that can support improved remote communication by seamlessly connecting IM and voice call conversations for small intimate groups.",

This pictorial presents design explorations, four design concepts, and one prototype of a sensor for measuring the conductivity of cervical mucus in vaginal fluids. We present these as instances in the design space for sensing intimate bodily fluids and provide discussions on the proximities, visibilities, and temporalities of these sensing technologies. We offer the unfolding concept of “tactful feminist sensing”, opening up for further engagements with intimate care that attend to the multiplicity and fleshiness of bodies.",

Here we investigate an interactive 3D printed model (I3M) that combines a conversational interface with haptic vibration and touch to provide more natural and accessible experiences. Specifically, we co-designed a multimodal model of the Solar System with nine blind people and evaluated the prototype with another seven blind participants. We discuss our journey from a design perspective, focusing on touch, conversational and multimodal interactions. Based on our experience, we suggest design recommendations that consider blind users' desire for independence and control, customisation, comfort and use of prior experience.",

      "abstract": "Models are interpretable when machine learning (ML) practitioners can readily understand the reasoning behind their predictions. Ironically, little is known about the ML practitioners' experience of discovering and adopting novel interpretability techniques in production settings. In a qualitative study with 18 practitioners at a large technology company working with text data, we found that despite varied tasks, practitioners experienced nearly identical challenges related to interpretability methods in model analysis workflows. These stem from problem formulation, the social nature of interpretability investigations, and non-standard practices in cross-functional organizational contexts. A follow-up examination of early-stage design probes with seven practitioners suggests that self-reported experts are \"perpetual intermediates\", who can benefit from regular, responsive, and in-situ education about interpretability methods across workflows, regardless of prior experience with models, analysis tools, or interpretability techniques. From these findings, we emphasize the need for multi-stage support for learning of interpretability methods for real-world NLP applications.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the new design space of extra-linguistic cues inspired by graphical tropes used in graphic novels and animation to enhance the expressiveness of social robots. To achieve this, we identified a set of cues that can be used to generate expressions, including smoke/steam/fog, water droplets, and bubbles. We prototyped devices that can generate these fluid expressions for a robot and conducted design sessions where eight designers explored the use and utility of the cues in conveying the robot's internal states in various design scenarios. Our analysis of the 22 designs, the associated design justifications, and the interviews with designers revealed patterns in how each cue was used, how they were combined with nonverbal cues, and where the participants drew their inspiration from. These findings informed the design of an integrated module called EmoPack, which can be used to augment the expressive capabilities of any robot platform. ",

      "abstract": "According to the World Bank, 33% of women in Sub-Saharan Africa experience domestic violence due to men’s social status over them. Prior research suggests that smart home security systems can perpetuate patriarchal attitudes at the expense of women’s rights. However, women’s perspectives on smart home security systems are not well understood. This paper presents a study with 33 Malawian women to understand how these technologies might be used in their homes. Based on interviews and focus group discussions, we present women’s perspectives on using smart home security systems and how they might exacerbate patriarchy. We found that while these technologies provide opportunities for supporting domestic security, they may affect women’s privacy as they complete everyday activities, like cooking. We use design sessions to explore opportunities for designing these technologies in patriarchal societies. This study expands existing discussion about smart home security systems by considering how patriarchal norms shape their utilization.",

      "abstract": "Noticing differently commits to stepping out of familiar reference frameworks while attending to oft-neglected actors, relations, and ways of knowing for design. Photovoice is an arts- and community-based participatory approach allowing individuals to communicate their lives and stories about pressing community concerns through photography. This paper bridges photovoice and the commitment to noticing in HCI and design through a photovoice project with Detroit residents on safety and surveillance. The photovoice process---alongside the production, reflection, and dissemination of photographs---makes residents' everyday situations legible and sensible, allowing both community members and researchers to orient to and engage with multiple viewpoints, sensibilities, and temporal trajectories. This process confronts the invisibility of both the sociotechnical infrastructures (in our case, surveillance infrastructures) and minoritized communities' relational ontologies. By advocating participatory noticing in design research, we show the opportunities for adopting arts- and community-based participatory approaches in decentering dominant ways of knowing and seeing, while at the same time fostering community capacity and relations for future potentialities.",

      "abstract": "Research on aging technologies typically has explored health condition management and physical activity, while other aspects of active aging (e.g., psychological and social well-being) receive less attention. To better support active aging, we focus on the context of tracking technologies because half of the U.S. aging population engaged in keeping records of health and non-health information using manual and digital mediums. We interviewed 18 older adults to investigate their holistic tracking practices. We found participants were motivated to manage their everyday life tasks, preserve sentimental values, generate knowledge for broader audiences, and support relationships and caregiving. These motivations can help older adults age actively by supporting multi-dimensions of well-being besides physical health. Reflecting on findings, we discuss design considerations for tracking technologies to support active aging by expanding the current focus on supporting physical health to broader psychological and social well-being.

      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the relationship between art and HCI. New HCI research draws on artistic practices as a source of design inspiration, turns to the arts for assistance in solving wicked problems, or uses design research to understand artistic collaboration. Despite the widely noted potential of art-HCI research, the relationship between the two fields remains poorly understood, and precise descriptions of what makes art-HCI collaboration successful remain elusive. In this paper, we look at artist-in-residence (AiR) programs within STEM organizations as a way of learning about these collaborations. Drawing on interviews with individuals with recent involvement in these programs, we identify a series of design considerations for these residencies and note recurring concerns. Finally, we argue that many challenges in these programs arise from the instrumentalization of art, and recommend ways to foster more meaningful relations through AiR programs. ",

We engaged in a Research through Design process to improve the ideation of AI products and services. We developed a design resource capturing AI capabilities based on 40 AI features commonly used across various domains. To probe its usefulness, we created a set of slides illustrating AI capabilities and asked designers to ideate AI-enabled user experiences. We also incorporated capabilities into our own design process to brainstorm concepts with domain experts and data scientists. Our research revealed that designers should focus on innovations where moderate AI performance creates value.

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs; SAE levels 4 and 5) face substantial challenges regarding acceptance and UX. Novel human-machine interfaces (HMIs) providing transparent system information could account for those and facilitate adoption. However, since the availability of AVs for early concept studies is limited, context-based interface prototyping is required. This paper demonstrates the prototype and wizard-of-oz-based on-road evaluation of a futuristic windshield HMI concept that visualizes real-time object detections via augmented reality (AR).\r\nIn a mixed-methods within-subjects study (N=30), participants assessed three early-stage concept variants to explore whether object detection visualization can counteract the aforementioned challenges. The findings confirm that transparent system feedback can increase understandability, perceived usefulness, and hedonic UX, but the amount and the timing of the provided information are crucial. The applied prototyping method proved suitable for investigating HMI concepts with real-time AR on urban roads. Based on a critical discussion, the paper concludes with design and prototyping recommendations.",

      "abstract": "Text-to-image AI are capable of generating novel images for inspiration, but their applications for 3D design workflows and how designers can build 3D models using AI-provided inspiration have not yet been explored. To investigate this, we integrated DALL-E, GPT-3, and CLIP within a CAD software in 3DALL-E, a plugin that generates 2D image inspiration for 3D design. 3DALL-E allows users to construct text and image prompts based on what they are modeling. In a study with 13 designers, we found that designers saw great potential in 3DALL-E within their workflows and could use text-to-image AI to produce reference images, prevent design fixation, and inspire design considerations. We elaborate on prompting patterns observed across 3D modeling tasks and provide measures of prompt complexity observed across participants. From our findings, we discuss how 3DALL-E can merge with existing generative design workflows and propose prompt bibliographies as a form of human-AI design history.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) glasses separate dyadic interactions on different sides of the lens, where the person wearing the glasses (primary user) sees an AR world overlaid on their partner (secondary actor). The secondary actor interacts with the primary user understanding they are seeing both physical and virtual worlds. We use grounded theory to study interaction tasks, participatory design sessions, and in-depth interviews of 10 participants and explore how AR real-time modifications affect them. We observe a power imbalance attributed to the: (1) lack of transparency of the primary user's view, (2) violation of agency over self-presentation, and (3) discreet recording capabilities of AR glasses. This information asymmetry leads to a negotiation of behaviors to reach a silently understood equilibrium. This paper addresses underlying design issues that contribute to power imbalances in dyadic interactions and offers nuanced insights into the dynamics between primary users and secondary actors. ",

      "abstract": "While speculative methods (e.g., design fiction) could help industry to reflect critically about future products and services, little is known about their potentials and limits when applied in a corporate setting. In this case, we worked with an automobile manufacturer to explore the near future of self-driving cars. For more than a year, we speculated using diverse methods, developed stories about a future with self-driving cars, and told them through 24 artifacts (e.g., city map, quick start guides). In this paper, we scrutinize the process, discuss what has worked and what not, which challenges we faced, and how corporate requirements shaped the emerging design fiction. We saw a trend toward affirmative rather than speculative design, driven by product-centricity and the need to justify process and outcome through concrete innovation. While speculation raised interesting questions about technological futures, it remained a challenge to transform them into concrete design implications.",

Supporting efforts in finding alternatives to capitalism requires understanding the role of design in imagining alternative economic futures and reaching those most harmed by current capitalistic models. Through a collaboration between a community organization in Detroit and a team of university researchers, we hosted and facilitated a five-week workshop series with Black and Brown working-class Detroiters where they collectively imagined alternative economic futures using speculative design. They proposed Community Capitalism, Childcare Collectives, and Village-Based Childcare as alternative economy concepts from the workshops and described their unique characteristics and traits of love, care, and inclusion. Aligning with generative justice frameworks, Detroiters prioritized sustainable families and communities. We contribute an understanding of technology's role in the imagined economic futures, a discussion of what this means for community-involved governance, and a push for centering Afrofuturism in speculative design approaches to foster futures literacy.

      "abstract": "Public surveys intend to integrate civic values into official decision-making.\r\nBecause such surveys are typically infrastructured from the top-down, citizens' participatory agency is often reduced to reacting to concerns that may not align with their bottom-up needs. This paper presents PosterTalk, a physically situated and digitally facilitated middle-out survey platform that explicitly involved bottom-up citizens in its gatekeeping activities. Over a four months in-the-wild deployment, PosterTalk accumulated 41 inquiries and 420 responses spanning over 13 civic themes. \r\nIts emerging survey content directly influenced the local policy agenda of the facilitating neighbourhood committee, and nudged them to reassess their civic representativeness. \r\nBy critically analysing the different survey content and stakeholder engagements, this paper contributes an encompassing middle-out framework to guide and benchmark participatory agency in future public survey deployments and offers four guidelines for diversifying bottom-up civic agendas, readjusting top-down representation, avoiding bottom-up misperceptions of power, and promoting top-down introspection.",

      "abstract": "Designing technology for dance presents a unique challenge to conventional design research and methods. It is subject to diverse and idiosyncratic approaches to the artistic practice that it is situated. We investigated this by joining a dance company to develop interactive technologies for a new performance. From our firsthand account, we show the design space to be messy and non-linear, demanding flexibility and negotiation between multiple stakeholders and constraints. Through interviews with performers and choreographers, we identified nine themes for incorporating technology into dance, revealing tensions and anxiety, but also evolution and improvised processes to weave complex layers into a finished work. We find design for dance productions to be resistant to formal interpretation, requiring designers to embrace the intertwining stages, steps, and methods of the artistic processes that generate them. We suggest that our findings can be of value in other HCI contexts requiring flexible design approaches.",

      "abstract": "Tools supporting immersive live video conferencing (VC) have gained popularity recently across diverse application domains. A core component of the experience is augmenting video communication with multimodal interactive media. While many direct-manipulation techniques for VC communication have been proposed in existing literature, the usability and preferences for these techniques have never been formally studied. In this paper, we examine how embodied interaction democratizes content authoring, and propose a rehearsal-to-performance (RtP) framework along with a VC system, CLIO, that enables performers to directly interact with their media using voice, gesture, and external devices such as tablets. We evaluate existing operation-to-modality mappings for VC communication, as well as describe novel mappings not present in the literature. A series of studies demonstrate modality preferences and potentials for incorporating real-time direct-manipulation tools to create expressive augmented VC performances.",

Material choice for 3D printing is tightly connected to these challenges, and as such researchers and designers are exploring sustainable alternatives. Building on these efforts, this work explores using spent coffee grounds as a sustainable material for prototyping with 3D printing. This material, in addition to being compostable and recyclable,  can be easily made and printed at home. We describe the material in detail, including the process of making it from readily available ingredients, its material characteristics and its printing parameters. We then explore how it can support sustainable prototyping practices as well as HCI applications. In reflecting on our design process, we discuss challenges and opportunities for the HCI community to support sustainable prototyping and personal fabrication. We conclude with a set of design considerations for others to weigh when exploring sustainable materials for 3D printing and prototyping.",

Previous HCI works have explored how cuteness can be leveraged to create more joyful user experiences across a variety of technologies, for example, in the design of cute interfaces for AI agents and the cute physical and behavioral aspects of robots. These works rely on the “Baby Schema” identified by ethologist Konrad Lorenz to apply cuteness as a decoration. This pictorial explores ways that artists and designers can contribute their cultural and aesthetic understandings of cuteness to create richer interactive experiences. Our interpretive framework serves as a provocation for discussing the value of style in the design of interactive systems, and provides guidance for defining cuteness building blocks to support interdisciplinary teams of artists, designers and engineers in the creation of cute user experiences.",

      "abstract": "Building shape-changing, robotic or deployable interfaces is notoriously difficult, often requiring fabrication skills or specialized hardware. We present a construction kit for novice users to enable immediate hands-on exploration of custom shape-changing or robotic structures through pneumatically actuated origami tubes. Our construction kit consists of generic origami actuators that can be combined with our connectors to result in a variety of shapes and motions. Our novel connectors support simple mechanical connections through snap fits and pneumatic configurations through plugs. To assist users in designing and previewing complex deformations, we provide a design tool that generates control code for user-defined designs. We envision that our construction kit will facilitate creativity support tasks (e.g. product design) or education. We demonstrate the capabilities of our construction kit with three application examples and a series of objects created during our co-creation study with novice users.",

      "abstract": "The think-aloud protocol is an effective method frequently used by designers and researchers to understand how users interact with computing systems. However, there is limited research on the use of this method with deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) populations, especially in virtual settings. In this paper, we investigate the behaviors of DHH participants in virtual think-aloud sessions to better understand the challenges of conducting this type of research with this population. We conducted twelve virtual think-aloud sessions with DHH participants using Zoom, and we gathered feedback from surveys, interviews, and observations. Our results identified DHH behaviors leading to a lack of clarity in think-aloud data, such as asynchrony between signing and navigating the interfaces, as well as the use of visual descriptive signs instead of explicit terminology to ambiguously refer to interface components. Based on our findings, we provide methodological and design implications to help researchers effectively carry out virtual think-aloud studies with DHH participants (e.g., when and how to prompt for clarification).",

      "abstract": "We describe the design of Loci Stories – a networked storytelling cabinet which uses voice recognition to tell colourful and unique stories from volunteers working at an English country hall. Loci Stories was created as part of a wider co-design research within heritage venues that sought to improve interpretation and designs approaches engaging with polyvocality. The work aimed to nuance existing authorised heritage discourse interpretations by championing the stories of volunteers who have a unique perspective on the place. We contribute an account of our design and its evaluation findings to propose four “textures” of polyvocality inspired by music theory – monophony, homophony, polyphony, and cacophony. We discuss Loci Stories through the lens of these textures and situate our work in furthering the design space of polyvocal heritage-based interaction design.",

      "abstract": "Science writers commonly use extended metaphors to communicate unfamiliar concepts in a more accessible way to a wider audience. However, creating metaphors for science writing is challenging even for professional writers; according to our formative study (n=6), finding inspiration and extending metaphors with coherent structures were critical yet significantly challenging tasks for them. We contribute Metaphorian, a system that supports science writers with the creation of scientific metaphors by facilitating the search, extension, and iterative revision of metaphors. Metaphorian uses a large language model-based workflow inspired by the heuristic rules revealed from a study with six professional writers. A user study (n=16) revealed that Metaphorian significantly enhances satisfaction, confidence, and inspiration in metaphor writing without decreasing writers' sense of agency. We discuss design implications for creativity support for figurative writing in science.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated Australian older adults' response to the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, the adjustments they made to their activities, technology use, and social relations, to inform how technology design could be inspired by these adaptations. Online interviews revealed that some sorely missed social interactions, however, most enjoyed having a greater agency to curate their own activities and slowing down as a result of lockdown. These findings prompted us to rethink the design space of temporal design from the perspective of those craving an ongoing impact of slowness in their lives. We suggest that designing for a slower pace of life can be inspired by people's response to life circumstances in lockdown, complementing the original concept of slow technology which seeks to intervene in a fast-paced life to encourage people to slow down and reflect. We conclude by proposing three new design pathways based on this new standpoint.",

Our study involved design workshops with 15 gardeners, who engaged with different prompts (phenology wheel, nature cards, and paper prototypes) to provoke relational thought for creating nature fictions. Through this process, we identified three design spaces that illustrate the relevance of the nature fictions approach: 1) Community building through awareness and collaboration around nature, 2) Multispecies care in the garden, and 3) Creating balance in public spaces – From the garden to society. We discuss key tensions and anxieties, and opportunities for each design space, and we reflect on working with nature fictions and more-than-human thought.",

These benefits may be mediated by self-transcendent emotions evoked by nature. \r\n\r\nWe need to explore the capacity of technology to offer such experiences when we lack access to the restorative power of nature.\r\nDespite growing research validating this capacity, there is a lack of articulated design knowledge of how such experiences can be created.\r\n\r\nHere, we explore a technologically-mediated support for mental well-being through an agile design approach informed by self-transcendent emotion theory and transformative experience design.\r\n\r\nWe developed Awedyssey as a sensory deprivation countermeasure experience in virtual reality (VR) and as a part of a public exhibition. We gathered qualitative feedback through interviews, diaries, and surveys. From this data we identified design tensions for designing complex emotional experiences when considering the diversity of individuals and dual effects of designing for realism, autonomy, vastness, and comfort.",

      "abstract": "Multi-modal classroom sensing systems can collect complex behaviors in the classroom at a scale and precision far greater than human observers to capture learning insights and provide personalized teaching feedback. As students are critical stakeholders in the adoption of smart classrooms for the improvement of teaching, open questions remain in understanding student perspectives on the use of their data to provide insights to instructors. We conducted a Speed Dating with storyboards study to explore student values and boundaries regarding the acceptance of classroom sensing systems in STEM college courses. We found that students have several emergent beliefs about teaching and learning that influence their views towards smart classroom technologies. Students also held contextual views on the boundaries of data use depending on the outcome. Our findings have implications for the design and communication of classroom sensing systems that reconcile student and instructor beliefs around teaching and learning.",

This paper draws on speculative design to explore, question, and problematize consequences of AR becoming pervasive. Elaborating on Desjardin et al.'s bespoke booklets, we co-speculate together with 12 globally dispersed participants. Each participant received a custom-made design workbook containing pictures of their immediate surroundings, which they elaborated on in situated brainstorming activities. We present an integration of their speculative ideas and lived experiences in 3 overarching themes from which 7 `dark' scenarios caused by UAR were formed. The Scenarios are indicative of deceptive design patterns that can (and likely will be) devised to misuse UAR, and anti-patterns that could cause unintended consequences. These contributions enable the timely discussion of potential antidotes and to which extent they can mitigate imminent harms of UAR.",

      "abstract": "Timbre exploration and creation are key tasks in electronic music composition. Modern synthesizers can produce thousands of unique timbres, but this complexity hinders musicians' ability to explore these timbres effectively. We contribute SoundTraveller, an interactive timbre exploration system aimed at fostering electronic musicians' creative processes. SoundTraveller allows the user to explore the timbral space using two modes: evolutionary and morphing, with which they can generate hundreds of unique timbres without the need to edit individual parameters. Our user study confirmed that SoundTraveller supported participants' exploration, decreased their cognitive load, and increased their perceived creativity. Through analysis of our interview study, we contribute design considerations for timbre exploration systems, and for exploring large aesthetic parameter spaces more generally. Finally, we discuss how systems like SoundTraveller can fit into the existing workflows of electronic music composers, and how shared agency with creative technologies can impact the creative process.",

      "abstract": "HCI researchers are increasingly concerned about the prevalence of manipulative design strategies in user interfaces, commonly referred to as \"dark patterns\". The line between manipulation and persuasion strategies is often blurred, leading to legal and ethical concerns. This paper examines the tension between persuasive UX practices and manipulative designs. UX/UI design professionals (n=22), split into eight focus groups, conducted design activities on two fictitious scenarios. We qualitatively analysed their discussions regarding strategies for influencing user behaviours and their underlying reasoning. Our findings reveal a combination of classical UI design strategies like sticky interfaces and incentives as their most common practice to influence user behaviour. We also unveil that trust, transparency, and user autonomy act as guiding principles for the professionals in assessing their ideas. However, a thorough approach is missing; despite a general user-first attitude, they feel constrained by contextual factors. We explain how the tensions between principles and context contribute to manipulative designs online.",

      "abstract": "Sojourner Truth’s portraits with her knitting needles remind us of the entanglements of race, gender, labor and resistance that are at the foundations of transformative approaches required for reworking design. In this paper, I outline Black feminist technoscience as a framework that bridges Black feminism and feminist technoscience in order to connect its critical theory that unpacks power and liberation through the lived experiences of Black women to work in feminist technoscience that has produced important critical scholarship on design and technology. Shifting our focus to Black women heightens our understanding of the transgressive systems embedded in design and opportunities to transform it. I explore core principles of Black feminist technoscience, including intersectionality, coming to voice, the personal and situated, (Black) temporality, (em)bodied ecologies and the ethic of care. Finally, I present Black feminist technoscience as a praxis that is grounded in storytelling as a method for reworking design. ",

      "abstract": "Our bodies are home to an unseen ecosystem of microbes that live in symbiosis with us. In this work, we extend the “human” in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to include these microbes. Specifically, we explore the skin microbiome as an intimate material for interaction design. Viewing the body as a microbial interface, we start by presenting a method to grow our microbiome such that it becomes visible to the human eye. We then present a design space that explores how different environmental parameters, such as temperature and growth media, can be controlled to influence the color of the microbiome. We further investigate how our interactions in a daily uncontrolled environment (e.g., exercising, hugging, typing) can impact the microbiome. We demonstrate several wearable applications that reveal and control the microbiome. Lastly, we address the challenges and opportunities of working with the microbiome as an intimate, living material for interaction design.",

      "abstract": "We use a design workbook of speculative scenarios as a values elicitation activity with 14 participants. The workbook depicts use case scenarios with smart home camera technologies that involve surveillance and uneven power relations. The scenarios were initially designed by the researchers to explore scenarios of privacy and surveillance within three social relationships involving “primary” and “non-primary” users: Parents-Children, Landlords-Tenants, and Residents-Domestic Workers. When the scenarios were utilized as part of a values elicitation activity with participants, we found that they reflected on a broader set of interconnected social values beyond privacy and surveillance, including autonomy and agency, physical safety, property rights, trust and accountability, and fairness. The paper suggests that future research about ethical issues in smart homes should conceptualize privacy as interconnected with a broader set of social values (which can align or be in tension with privacy), and reflects on considerations for doing research with non-primary users.

      "abstract": "Research and design in human-computer interaction centers problem-solving, causing a downstream effect of framing work with and for marginalized communities predominantly from the lens of deficit and damage. Frameworks such as assets-based design and designing for resilience have emerged to highlight the strengths of these communities. However, we observe an additional need to center positive aspects of humanity, such as joy, pleasure, rest, and cultural heritage, particularly for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color. In this paper, we present three case studies of existing technologies that center BIPOC flourishing to provide an alternative path for HCI. We propose six actionable tenets for designing for flourishing in the everyday: (1) seek opportunities to design for self-actualization, (2) identify and center the desire to flourish, (3) collaborate and distribute power, (4) refrain from damage-centered reductionism, (5) bring the humanity of a community into the design process, (6) and evaluate for self-sustainability.",

      "abstract": "Automatically integrating data within interactive clinical checklists allows for enhanced dynamic displays, while also providing information needed for checklist adaptation to the context of the medical event. In this mixed-methods study, we used user-centered design sessions with clinicians to design a checklist interface that automatically captures and displays dynamic patient data. We compared the manual and automatic checklist versions during video-guided simulation sessions, evaluating the effects of automatic capture on clinicians’ interactions with dynamic data and their situation awareness. Despite clinicians’ concerns that automatic data capture would affect situation awareness, we found no significant difference in awareness scores. Participants preferred the automatic version, highlighting its improved accuracy and completeness. From our findings, we propose a framework for capturing dynamic data and designing dynamic data interfaces within interactive checklists. We conclude by discussing barriers and design opportunities for supporting awareness of data trends through checklists.",

      "abstract": "Voice assistants have sharply risen in popularity in recent years, but their use has been limited mostly to simple applications like music, hands-free search, or control of internet-of-things devices. They have also been critiqued for their weak conversation skills. What would it take for voice assistants to guide people through more complex tasks? In our work, we study the limitations of the dominant approach voice assistants take to complex task guidance: reading aloud written instructions. Using recipes as an example, we observe twelve participants cook at home with a state-of-the-art voice assistant. We learn that the current approach obscures the bigger picture and overwhelms users with too much information, among seven other challenges. Instructions delivered by a voice assistant are particularly difficult because they cannot be skimmed as easily as written instructions. We draw on our observations to propose eight ways in which voice assistants can \"rewrite the script\"---like summarizing, splitting, or reordering information---to transform written sources into forms that are readily communicated through spoken conversation. We conclude with a vision of how new work in natural language processing can be leveraged for intelligent systems to guide users effectively through complex tasks.",

      "abstract": "Sleep has been studied as an individual activity, with the interconnected behaviors among family members being rarely considered. In this study, by incorporating the identified themes from the previous phase, we designed and tested two types of family-based sleep management systems: Bedtime Pal and Caring Heart. These systems redistributed sleep-relevant tasks among family members, so that they would have the chance to reflect on the difficulties and values involved in those tasks. We deployed the two prototypes and performed an in-the-wild study with 12 families in their homes. This study empirically revealed the importance of considering social dynamics as a design factor for family sleep management technologies. Design implications for sleep management technologies are discussed. ",

We elaborate on our collaborative commitments that include a focus on materiality and particular team dynamics. We report on three frictions we experienced while working on a TC2 jacquard loom: the translation of weaving patterns from one production technique to another, working within the material limitations of the loom, and the design of a woven box that allowed us to articulate differing perspectives on failures. In our discussion, we argue that these material encounters are a way for design and creation research to work through tensions at play between digital technologies, artistic practices, and cultural continuities.

We report on our experience co-designing educational games with six culturally and socioeconomically diverse afterschool sites over two years, and insights from interviewing ten program administrators across all sites. We found that even within the same afterschool program network, site differences in organizational culture and resources impacted the effectiveness of co-design programs, the co-design output, and expectations for student engagement. We characterize our afterschool partners into different archetypes – Safe Havens, Recreation Centers, Homework Helpers, and STEM Enrichment Centers. We provide recommendations for conducting co-design at each archetype and reflect on strategies for increasing equitable partnerships between researchers and afterschool centers. ",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has enabled scalable auto-creation of context-based personalized learning materials. However, it remains unclear how content personalization shapes the learners' experience. We developed one personalized and two non-personalized, crowdsourced versions of a mobile language learning app: (1) with personalized auto-generated photo flashcards, (2) the same flashcards provided through crowdsourcing, and (3) manually generated flashcards based on the same photos. A two-week in-situ study (n=64) showed that learners assessed the quality of the non-personalized auto-generated material to be on par with manually generated material, which means that auto-generation is viable. However, when the auto-generation was personalized, the learners' quality rating was significantly lower. Further analyses suggest that aspects such as prior expectations and required efforts must be addressed before learners can actually benefit from context-based personalization with auto-generated material. We discuss resulting design implications and provide an outlook on the role of content personalization in AI-supported learning.",

      "abstract": "Designing for values has been a focus of human-computer interaction research, but what happens when value-laden design artifacts are put into practice? Do they exercise their commitment to stated design values? We present four case studies that suggest a gap between the values that technologies set out to support and their performance toward supporting these values in practice. By critically analyzing these case studies, we theorize the phenomenon of value dilution—technical artifacts moving away from values they committed to embody. We hypothesize two significant methodological gaps contributing to value dilution—the static framing of stakeholders and a lack of engagement with politics of values. We argue that addressing value dilution needs to be a long-term and ongoing task in the design and use of technology as values in design are not only embodied, but also they are dynamic, subject to change in how they are enacted.",

We conducted two qualitative studies to explore the design of conversational agents (CAs) that can support BLV players’ learning and provide companionship. In Study 1, we recruited 14 BLV participants and identified their rule learning challenges, with emphasis on cognitive load, and co-designed functional and social characteristics in Amazon Alexa that can support rule learning and offer companionship. We then developed a new Alexa skill and had 9 BLV participants evaluate our skill against the Alexa skill for the game Ticket to Ride (Study 2). We generated four design principles for CAs to support board game rule learning for BLV people: conciseness, pausing capacity, customization, and companionship. \r\n",

      "abstract": "As digital photos grow exponentially, people need new approaches to engage with their photos over time. We describe our study of PhotoClock, a mobile application that leverages the temporal metadata embedded in digital photos to encourage contemplation of memories bound up in one’s photo archive. PhotoClock uses the clock-time of the present moment to re-present one’s photos taken around that same time of the day in the past. As time ticks away relentlessly, PhotoClock highlights the ephemeral and ongoing quality of time. We conducted the field study with 12 participants over 8 weeks. Our goals are: (i) to investigate the reflective potential of clock-time as an alternative design approach for supporting memory-oriented photo interaction, and (ii) to explore conceptual propositions related to slowness and temporality. Findings revealed that PhotoClock generated diverse and reflective experiences on participants’ life stories. We conclude with implications and opportunities for future HCI and design research.",

Many engage in online shopping, which eliminates some challenges of physical shopping. However, clothes shopping online suffers from many other limitations and barriers. More research is needed to address these challenges, and extant works often base their findings on interviews alone, providing only subjective, recall-biased information. We conducted two complementary studies using both observational and interview approaches to fill a gap in understanding about VI people's behaviour when selecting and purchasing clothes online. Our findings show that shopping websites suffer from inaccurate, misleading, and contradictory clothing descriptions; that VI people mainly rely on (unreliable) search tools and check product descriptions by reviewing customer comments. Our findings also indicate that VI people are hesitant to accept assistance from automated, but that trust in such systems could be improved if researchers can develop systems that better accommodate users' needs and preferences.\r\n\r\n",

Therefore, as a pilot study, this paper investigates how Participatory Action Research (PAR), principally the integration of interactive technology with co-design activities, can be applied to support the producing and sharing of community-based immigrant heritage for British-Chinese citizens. In addition, the reasoning behind why British-Chinese communities have faced cross-cultural barriers when sharing their values and significance of their heritage more widely within British society during the COVID-19 pandemic has also been explored. This study potentially makes a significant contribution to the literature because design-led inquiry was used to explore design strategies and considerations of interactive technology that improved the participation of British-Chinese immigrants in sharing the significance of their intangible heritage socially, equally, and coherently during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      "abstract": "Gig workers, and the products and services they provide, play an increasingly ubiquitous role in our daily lives. But despite growing evidence suggesting that worker well-being in gig economy platforms have become significant societal problems, few studies have investigated possible solutions. We take a stride in this direction by engaging workers, platform employees, and local regulators in a series of speed dating workshops using storyboards based on real-life situations to rapidly elicit stakeholder preferences for addressing financial, physical, and social issues related to worker well-being. Our results reveal that existing public and platformic infrastructures fall short in providing workers with resources needed to perform gigs, surfacing a need for multi-platform collaborations, technological innovations, as well as changes in regulations, labor laws, and the public's perception of gig workers, among others. Drawing from multi-stakeholder findings, we discuss these implications for technology, policy, and service as well as avenues for collaboration.\r\n",

      "abstract": "As a research tradition, participatory design (PD) tends to focus on power dynamics where researchers hold greater power than participants. This paper uses design fiction to consider what this tendency overlooks by examining settings where participants may exist in multiple power relationships simultaneously implicated by the research, specifically focusing on the contexts of misinformation, disinformation, and online hate (M/D/OH). Drawing from existing literature in M/D/OH, we present a series of imaginary method abstracts that prompt questions for researchers to reflect on as they adapt PD techniques for new, different contexts. We highlight three value tensions—authenticity, reciprocity, and impact—integral to sustaining a concern for responsibility in PD scholarship. We end with reflections and potential considerations for responsibly applying PD and design fiction methods in M/D/OH settings.",

Most user interactions with small devices consist of brief glances at the time or notifications. Consuming information from small displays poses challenges, which have been seldom studied from the perspective of older users. In this paper, we worked with older adults towards creating health data visualizations for them for small devices. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 older adults, in which we (1) conducted group discussions to understand participants' opinions, (2) measured times taken to interpret health data visualizations with and without progress information, (3) measured how much information they could manage to see during brief glances. When data was visualized without progress indicators, participants took less time to understand the data and made fewer errors. Participants preferred health data visualizations that featured peaceful, and positive pictorial representations. We present design opportunities for older adults' data visualizations in small devices.",

      "abstract": "A common way to enable immersion in VR is to render a virtual body that mirrors the user's physical movements.  VR allows us to design interaction schemes that go beyond direct avatar embodiments. In particular, there is a growing body of literature investigating the simultaneous control of multiple bodies in VR. We contribute to this literature by investigating the important case where multiple bodies perform a coordinated interaction with each other. Such actions directly question what kind of embodiment users experience. Concretely, we investigate people's abilities to perform coordinated bimanual selection and handoff tasks between a first-person and third-person body through a user study with 19 participants. Results provide quantitative \\& qualitative evidence for people's ability to perform complex coordinated tasks through two bodies. Furthermore we characterize  participant performance in different task and interaction configurations, summarize the strategies they employed, and discuss qualities of user's proprioception.\r\n",

      "abstract": "With recent computer vision techniques and user-generated content, we can augment the physical world with metadata that describes attributes, such as names, geo-locations, and visual features of physical objects. To assess the benefits of these potentially ubiquitous labels for foreign vocabulary learning, we built a proof-of-concept system that displays bilingual text and sound labels on physical objects outdoors using augmented reality. Established tools for language learning have focused on effective content delivery methods such as books and flashcards. However, recent research and consumer learning tools have begun to focus on how learning can become more mobile, ubiquitous, and desirable. To test whether our system supports vocabulary learning, we conducted a preliminary between-subjects (N=44) study. Our results indicate that participants preferred learning with virtual labels on real-world objects outdoors over learning with flashcards. Our findings motivate further investigation into mobile AR-based learning systems in outdoor settings.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an analysis of the user experience of Reframer, a novel human-AI drawing interface designed with the iterative and reflective nature of creativity in mind. Collaboration with Reframer occurs in real time, with the user and the system drawing together concurrently. This approach is inspired  by theories of creativity as being more problem-framing than problem-solving, and contrasts with the automated one-shot end-to-end workflows of most generative AI models. A 12-participant qualitative exploratory study of the capabilities of our prototype is detailed, as well as a thematic analysis of user attitudes towards drawing with it. The paper then describes two modified prototypes and a second 32-participant comparative study revealing how interface variations evoke differences in user attitudes and experiences. It concludes by proposing a model that characterises the conditions under which users experience co-creative AI as a collaborator, rather than a non-agentive tool.",

      "abstract": "Some people with a motor disability that limits hand movements use technology to draw via their eyes. Free-eye drawing has been re-investigated recently and yielded state-of-the-art results via unimodal gaze control. However, limitations remain, including limited functions, conflicts between observation and drawing, and the brush tailing issue. We introduce a professional unimodal gaze control free-eye drawing application and improve upon free-eye drawing by extended gaze-based user interface functions, improved brush dynamics, and a double-blink gaze gesture. An experiment and a field study were conducted to assess the system's usability compared to the mainstream gaze-control drawing method and hand drawing and the accessibility among users with motor disabilities. The results showed that the application provides efficient interaction and the ability to create hand-sketch-level graphics for people with motor disabilities. Herein, we contribute a robust and professional free-eye drawing application, detailing valuable design considerations for future developments in gaze interaction.",

But how will 6G transform mobility and communication within a country facing the challenges of a rapidly aging population and the growing threat of natural disasters? We investigate how 6G-enabled technologies could shape social and economic values in Japan in the next decade. To accomplish this, our team has created frameworks informed by secondary research, workshops, and storytelling to develop scenarios for Japan in 2030 and beyond. This paper describes our design process, as well as how our methodologies generated four distinctive future scenarios where 6G technologies are actively used in the context of Japan. The speculative futures presented in this paper are intended to spark discussion about the implications of novel technologies and present ways in which design-led research can drive technological innovation forward.",

      "abstract": "Increasingly, IoT kits are used in pedagogical contexts to support learning experiences and teach students about IoT. However, few of them focus on both the technical aspects and the societal implications of IoT, such as cybersecurity and privacy. In this paper, we describe the Orbit IoT Kit, a micro:bit-based toolkit that supports teachers in IoT activities. The kit combines the microcontroller with relays and a web application, enabling students to connect everyday objects to the Internet and visualize the devices' data flow. Based on an intervention in a secondary school with 3 teachers and 20 students of ages 12-13, our results indicate that the design and features of the kit — internet communication and data visualization — support teachers to engage students in learning about a holistic perspective of IoT. We reflect on our research propositions, discuss design strategies, and present three design recommendations for IoT toolkits: Connectivity, Visualization, and Openness. ",

      "abstract": "Labor shortages have shaped many industries over the past several years, with hospitality experiencing one of the largest rates of attrition. Workers are leaving their jobs for a variety of reasons, ranging from burnout and work intensification to a lack of meaningful employment. While some literature maintains that labor-replacing automation is poised to bridge the shortages, we argue there is an opportunity for technology design to instead improve job quality and retention. Drawing on interviews with unionized guest room attendants, we report on workers’ perceptions of a widely-used algorithmic room assignment system. We then present worker-generated design ideas that adapt this system toward supporting three key facets of wellbeing: self-efficacy, transparency, and workload. We argue for the need to consider these facets of wellbeing through design across the service landscape, particularly as HCI attends to the impacts of AI and automation on frontline work.",

      "abstract": "AI-powered symptom checkers are automating the work of telephone triage nurses in assessing patient urgency. Yet, these systems exclude several vulnerable patient groups and overlook telenurses' competent interaction with their patients. This study, conducted in collaboration with telenurses, examines how AI can support their clinical assessment and was carried out in four phases: 1) interviews that revealed telenurses' challenge of juggling decision-support and documentation interfaces, 2) a co-design workshop that conceptualized continuous nurse-AI interaction, 3) development of a prototype that suggested questions for nurses to ask callers, and 4) a role-play workshop that demonstrated nurse-AI interaction in practice. The study addresses how we can design for control in human-AI collaboration in order to enhance, rather than replace, human decision-making processes.",

      "abstract": "Mindfulness technologies have gained research interest in recent years. We explore the use of smart-glasses (Optical Head Mounted Displays or OHMDs) for breath-based mindfulness practice as a well-being technology for everyday users. Since OHMDs do not occlude the wearer’s view, practitioners can access the digital environment while performing daily activities. Through our pilot series, we identified suitable visual and auditory attributes for OHMD mindfulness sessions in casual walking settings, and combined user-preferred features into our proposed Mindful Moments design. Results on physiological, sustained attention and self-reported mindfulness measures suggest that Mindful Moments facilitates higher state mindfulness than the Control. Its results proved comparable to the state-of-the-art Walking Meditation, while also being more accessible, convenient, and easy for novice practitioners to implement in everyday environments. We further evaluate Mindful Moments in a realistic setting, enhancing current understanding of mindfulness practice on OHMDs, thereby contributing a technique for improved health and well-being.",

      "abstract": "The rapid pace of technological progress carries with it a heightened risk of ethics and privacy violations, creating an urgent need for mechanisms to address this risk. We approach this problem from the perspective of designers and technologists aiming to design technology that better accounts for ethical implications. We iteratively developed a workshop-based method (𝑁 =113, seven workshops) for probing ethical implications of emerging ubiquitous computing technologies. We contribute a method that enables people with varying levels and areas of domain expertise and with a variety of lived experiences to collectively speculate about the ethical implications of emerging technologies, navigate value tensions, and prototype artifacts as a way to grapple with those tensions. We introduce implication design as a means for participants with and without design experience to communicate how a technology might change to better serve them. Lastly, we share our learnings from and reflections on our design process.",

In contrast, for this project, we wanted to use body sensor data as an artistic resource to craft wearable textile portraits as mementos of a moment in time. During the pandemic, we conducted a user study to design knitted biodata portraits. We met up individually with 20 participants to measure their heart rate, and translated that data into digitally-designed aesthetic patterns for machine knitting. Using a hacked knitting machine, we fabricated these patterns to create 20 personalized wearable shrugs to enable individuals to “wear their heart on their sleeve”. Two years later, when it was safe to do so, we conducted 2 studio workshops with participants, followed by 10 individual interviews. Our qualitative study insights reveal how individuals felt about seeing their own biodata, and the biodata of others, as aesthetic machine-knitted wearables with perceived precious value and attachment.",

Stress data engagement is crucial to the early detection and intervention of long-term stress which could cause harmful health effects. This paper explores the design of tangible displays to enhance engagement with self-tracked stress data. We conducted two co-design workshops in which participants were invited to design and draw sketches of stress displays for three different contexts. The workshops revealed many innovative ideas for using everyday spaces and materials as an interface to structure user interactions with the data, aimed at increasing awareness of stress data and management strategies while addressing various concerns associated with how the data is displayed. By focusing on stress data, this study highlights important opportunities to use everyday spaces as an interface for health data engagement.",

      "abstract": "Our study investigates the design practices of Hand-Proximate User Interfaces (HPUI) which are displayed on and around a user's hand in a head-mounted display (HMD). Specifically, we examine one-handed inputs where the main mode of interaction is thumb-to-finger contact. Our focus is on the user interface (UI) design of these displays, and we aim to develop design guidelines and heuristics for this novel design space. To achieve this, we conducted a participatory design study involving 15 participants who provided feedback on 120 different design examples, as well as their thoughts surrounding the HPUI design. Participants favored designs that were ergonomically comfortable and flexible, and those that provided clear visibility regardless of hand positioning. Based on this feedback, we developed 7 design guidelines for Hand Proximate User Interfaces. In applying these guidelines we find that common application interfaces can easily be accommodated using HPUI for use on head-mounted displays.",

      "abstract": "Remote Sighted Assistance (RSA) is a popular smartphone-mediated aid for people with blindness, where a sighted individual converses with a blind individual in a one-on-one (1:1) session. Since sighted assistants outnumber blind individuals (13:1), this paper investigates what happens when more than one sighted individual assists a single blind individual in a session. Specifically, we propose paired-volunteer RSA, a new paradigm where two sighted volunteers assist a single user with blindness. We investigate the feasibility, desirability, and challenges of this paradigm and explore its opportunities. Our study with 8 sighted volunteers and 9 blind users reveals that the proposed paradigm extends the one-on-one RSA to cover a broader range of more intellectual and experiential tasks, providing new and distinctive opportunities in supporting complex, open-ended tasks (e.g., pursuing hobbies, appreciating arts, and seeking entertainment). These opportunities can not only enrich the blind users' quality of life and independence but also offer a fun and engaging experience for the sighted volunteers. The study also reveals the costs of extended collaboration in this paradigm. Finally, we synthesize a taxonomy of tasks where the proposed RSA paradigm can succeed and outline how HCI researchers and system designers can realize this paradigm.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent systems learn and evolve depending on what kinds of input are given and how people actually use them after deployment. While such a characteristic may be a troubling property for AI user experience designers, it also imbues an intelligent system with an open-ended quality, empowering end-users to ‘design’ their own system in use to achieve more desired experiences. In light of this, we conducted in-depth interviews with 16 users of various AI-based everyday recommender systems, investigating how people design their AI user experiences in actual use contexts. Exploring people’s current experiences of adopting and adapting those systems to achieve their own desired experiences, we discovered three styles of end-user design of their experiences: teaching, resisting, and repurposing. We end with a discussion of the implications of our findings, recognizing end-users’ motivation to challenge a prescribed experience of an intelligent system.",

Through first-person, speculative, and situated generative design methods, we engaged with a range of forestry activities to explore their capacity to afford experiences based on joy and care. An analysis of our 16 trips to the forest (and the reflections they motivated) revealed 13 play potentials [6] of human-forest interactions: 13 aspects of forestry experiences that can be intrinsically joyful. We present them clustered as 5 overarching directions that can guide the design of technology that pays more attention to nature’s inherent playful character. Our work can inspire a new wave of forest technology that transcends techno-solutionism and privileges alternative values of joy and care.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic exemplified the complexity of the field of crisis communication, with multiple channels and streams of information and misinformation causing new challenges for the authorities and general public alike. This complexity requires better addressing the situated and interrelated aspects of sensemaking practices and platforms, and how different disciplines and organisations collaborate during a crisis to turn ambiguity into resilience, and complexity into comprehension. We use design research and participatory design methodology to draw on learnings from the Finnish context and response to COVID-19 and other crises. These insights are then used to create design principles that bridge crisis informatics theory with HCI knowledge to create speculative, diegetic artefacts, which embody new practices and platforms that can be used to encourage collaborative sensemaking to tackle complex, large-scale crises and therefore have a positive impact on the resilience of the society.",

      "abstract": "Social virtual reality (VR) avatars hold promise for allowing people to represent themselves as they want to be seen. But most social VR environments constrain avatar options in ways that limit the accurate presentation of age and promote the assumption of youth. Through individual interviews with ten women in midlife, we explore experiences representing age and other aspects of identity in social VR. Participants expressed a desire to show age and gender with increased nuance: they sought more gradations of color, texture, and body types, and disliked the hypersexualization that resulted from integrated clothing and body parts. As they customized their avatars, participants struggled to depict both physical and personal characteristics, taking into account how others might evaluate their self-perception. These findings highlight opportunities for nuanced representations of physical attributes as well as options for representing the self at other levels: psychological, social, and aesthetic. ",

In this paper, we therefore explore how a robot emitting spatial sound affects a human’s impressions and behavior. Following a Research-through-Design (RtD) approach, we created two immersive robot sound designs which are emitted across the robot’s body and through speakers in the environment. In an evaluation study, participants interacted with the robot and shared their impressions through semi-structured interviews. Reactions showed that spatial robot sound had a notable effect on participant behavior and impressions, influencing, among others, how much attention they paid to the physical robot and how much animacy and agency they attributed to it. We report on our insights into how spatial sound may provide social robots with new ways to inform and engage the humans around them.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Many creative writing tasks (e.g., fiction writing) require authors to write complex narrative components (e.g., characterization, events, dialogue) over the course of a long story. Similarly, literary scholars need to manually annotate and interpret texts to understand such abstract components. In this paper, we explore how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and interactive visualization can help writers and scholars in such scenarios. To this end, we present Portrayal, an interactive visualization system for analyzing characters in a story. Portrayal extracts natural language indicators from a text to capture the characterization process and then visualizes the indicators in an interactive interface. We evaluated the system with 12 creative writers and scholars in a one-week-long qualitative study. Our findings suggest Portrayal helped writers revise their drafts and create dynamic characters and scenes. It helped scholars analyze characters without the need for any manual annotation, and design literary arguments with concrete evidence.",

This pictorial explores a design process, “Garbatrage,” wherein designers exploit the difference in value between parts in waste product and those used in new products. Drawing upon our own material re-use of hoverboards, we inductively outline a framework to help designers consider the micro- and macro-economic context of material recapture of waste components, necessary to make for more circular economies and sustainable supply chains at scale. We then apply this framework to identify other potential targets for Garbatrage. We conclude with opportunities for design to make the practice of Garbatrage more widely adoptable. ",

These applications are no longer perceived as distant, instrumental entities, but offer a more affective and intimate experience. In this paper, we address the long-term experience of living with a digital contraception technology that utilizes self-tracking. We draw upon four design workshops with a total of 14 users of the app Natural Cycles to illustrate moments of ambivalent affects and oscillating relations. Based on our analysis, we concretize four dimensions of ambivalence in different scales and temporalities. We propose three strategies of designing with these unavoidable disruptions, conflicting feelings, and shifting relations to acknowledge users’ agentic engagements, nuanced dynamics of intimate self-tracking experiences, and users as embodied and affective beings. We contend that by attending to these existential ambivalences, digital contraceptive can become better configured to plural modes of life and long-term intimate relations that they engender.",

      "abstract": "Metaverse platforms such as Roblox have become increasingly popular and profitable through a business model that relies on their end users to create and interact with user-generated virtual worlds (UGVWs). However, UGVWs are difficult to moderate, because game design is inherently more complex than static content such as text and images; and Roblox, a game platform targeted primarily at child players, is notorious for harmful user-generated game such as Nazi roleplay games and gambling-like mechanisms. To develop a better understanding of how harmful design is embedded in UGVWs, we conducted an empirical study to understand Roblox users’ experiences with harmful design. We identified several primary ways in which user-generated game designs can be harmful, ranging from directly injecting inappropriate content into the virtual environment of UGVWs to embedding problematic incentive mechanisms into the UGVWs. We further discuss opportunities and challenges for mitigating harmful designs.",

      "abstract": "We present the design of the Memory Machine (MeMa), a technology probe that can store, contextualise, and document media to represent memories. We accumulate vast physical and digital possessions throughout our lives, making it difficult to distinguish value in amassed images, albums, videos, mementos, and music. One option we wanted to explore via MeMa was to frame personal memories as a gift, in turn providing a way to revisit, share, and collate personal archives. We deployed MeMa into participants' homes and tasked them to create a digital gift involving an autobiographical memory. Through qualitative methods we uncovered the experience of twelve gift-givers. We found that the framing as a gift brought meaning to a collection of media, promoting reflection and emotional reminiscence in participants. Our contributions include design implications involving the relationship between emotions, technology, and gifting.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the value of a participant-led walking method, during which matters of place in urban or rural contexts are explored. While walking, a diverse dataset is collected, including audio recordings, photographs, GPS tracks, as well as three words that participants are prompted for at each stop along the walk via a bespoke web application. We used this approach in an urban community in the UK and a rural community in Greece as part of ongoing place-based initiatives. Our findings show how participants connected personal and emotional stories with structural issues, countered official, ‘authorised’ discourses about both places, and how maps and videos created after the walks acted as boundary objects. We reflect on the claims of walking as a method that fosters equitable researcher-participant relationships, outline future design directions for participatory walking and mapping technologies, and consider the value of walking methods and map-making for participatory design.",

      "abstract": "This paper is a Research through Design (RtD) investigation that deeply reflects on our ambivalence with three design choices we made while designing in a multispecies context. The ongoing RtD project, called Turner Boxes, aims to design a technological network to interact with wild bees in an urban environment. The design choices negotiate challenges we encountered, including the potential effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) on bee ecologies; sucrose feeding as an established human-bee interaction; and the question of human intervention when designing in relation to other species. We analyze our negotiations of these challenges along with the practices of beekeepers and ecologists who were part of our investigation, to realize that ambivalence is a characteristic and a resource in multispecies designing. We extend this analysis through feminist epistemologies to articulate a position of diffraction, a standpoint from which to design in multispecies worlds in which interdependencies and differences are critical.",

      "abstract": "Pollinators decline nowadays has been recognized as one of the most threatening problems connected to biodiversity loss, yet concrete actions to tackle it fail to engage with relevant social actors, beyond scientists, bringing into the discussion local and embodied knowledge. To engage farmers and citizens in supporting pollinating insects, we developed a participatory action in the shape of a “rural performance”, which revolved around the character of a Robot and his mission of monitoring biodiversity in hosting farms. As the story unfolded and farmers & citizens actively took part in it, they were questioned about their idea of biodiversity and their relationships with pollinating insects. We suggest that the “rural performance” worked as a material deliberation method for citizens and farmers on the topic of pollination decline by situating a fictional robot and his speculative narrative in a real context where actual people could interact with and respond to him.

      "abstract": "Numerous methods and tools have been proposed to motivate or support ethical awareness in design practice. However, many existing resources are not easily discoverable by practitioners, and are often framed using language that is not accessible or resonant with everyday practice. In this paper, we present three complementary strands of work with the goal of increasing the ability of design and technology practitioners to locate and activate methods to support ethically-focused work practices. We first constructed a set of empirically-supported \"intentions\" to frame practitioners' selection of relevant ethics-focused methods based on interviews with practitioners from a range of technology and design professions. We then leveraged these intentions in the design and iterative evaluation of a website that supports practitioners in identifying opportunities for ethics-focused action. Building on these findings, we propose a set of design considerations to evaluate the practice resonance of resources in supporting ethics-focused practice, laying the groundwork for increased ecological resonance of ethics-focused methods and method selection tools.",

An increasing number of technologies are being developed to support remembering. However, so far, they seem to have not taken the opportunity yet to support remembering through bodily movements. To better understand how to design for such embodied remembering, we conducted a diary study with 12 participants who recorded their embodied remembering experiences in everyday life over a three-week period. Our thematic analysis of the diaries and interviews led to the creation of a framework that helps understand embodied remembering experiences (ERXs) based on the level of skilled and conscious movements used. We describe how this ERX framework could help with the design of technologies to support embodied remembering.",

In pilot robot co-design workshops in a local memory care facility, we noticed PLwD struggled to understand, express themselves, fully participate, and benefit from the experience. After reflecting on challenges with the facility's director of program development and education, we redesigned the workshops prioritizing elements of the Eden Alternative's well-being for PLwD: identity, connectedness, security, and autonomy. We delivered these new workshops over five weeks with 12 PLwD participants. Analysis of resulting video recordings and transcripts shows the new activities allowed participants to see themselves as having knowledge relevant to social robot design; to relate to each other, the robot, and the researchers; to feel comfortable; and to actively contribute to and offer valuable insights for robot design. Participants reported feeling meaning, growth, and joy during the workshops.",

Our attempt to design a robust chatbot by prompting GPT-3/4 alone suggests: not yet. Prompts made achieving “80%” UX goals easy, but not the remaining 20%. Fixing the few remaining interaction breakdowns resembled herding cats: We could not address one UX issue or test one design solution at a time; instead, we had to handle everything everywhere all at once. Moreover, because no prompt could make GPT reliably say “I don’t know” when it should, the user-GPT conversations had no guardrails after a breakdown occurred, often leading to UX downward spirals. These risks incentivized us to design highly prescriptive prompts and scripted bots, counter to the promises of LLM-powered chatbots. This paper describes this case study, unpacks prompting’s fickleness and its impact on UX design processes, and discusses implications for LLM-based design methods and tools.\r\n\r\n ",

      "abstract": "Digital fabrication practice such as 3D printing has increasingly moved into home and hobbyist environments. Beyond running machines, practitioners in these settings undertake maintenance and repair. However, acquiring the skills necessary for machine maintenance is a non-trivial process contingent on experience, equipment, and materials. We seek to better understand how practitioners develop the skills necessary to maintain their 3D printers. We collect interview and survey data from active members of online 3D printing communities to conceptualize themes to characterize current maintenance practice. We find that maintenance is core to our participants' 3D printing practice: practitioners develop maintenance routines that formalize tacit understandings of fabrication processes, advance expertise during required acts of repair, and rely on hands-on testing to reconcile differences between physical prints and digital models. Given our findings, we argue for considering maintenance as a core part of digital fabrication, and discuss implications for the design of future digital fabrication systems.",

      "abstract": "We designed the LilyTiny sewable microcontroller over ten years ago in an effort to make electronic textiles more accessible to students, educators, and novices; it was meant to be affordable, easy to get started with, and well-supported by curriculum. We also designed the LilyTiny with hopes of helping to bridge the gap between e-textile activities using only lights and batteries – and those requiring knowledge of Arduino programming. Following its pilot, the LilyTiny was released as a commercial product through SparkFun Electronics, costing about $5 (USD) and shipping pre-programmed to control various LED behaviors. Free curriculum was released alongside it, detailing six low-cost activities that could be taught without any prior electronics experience. \r\n\r\nThis paper shares our study of the LilyTiny's adoption since its release, especially with regard to computing education. We discuss several measures of impact, beginning with a review of derivative products and a multi-year analysis of sales data from the LilyTiny's sole distributor. We then augment our discussion with a survey of customer reviews, social media posts, and related computing education curriculum and research. Finally, we reflect on the experience of bringing a prototype to market – and how this work might invite broader discussion around defining and measuring impact. Ultimately, we do believe that our findings substantiate the LilyTiny's value in the computing education landscape – particularly when it comes to lowering barriers of entry to e-textiles.",

Stardust contains a set of dotted pattern cards and a secret set of 9 spices. The user engages with the kit by poking holes in the pattern card to reveal a unique art and a number that guides the user to a secret spice from the box. The user then places the poked pattern card over their favorite hot coffee or tea, and gently sprinkles the secret spice over it, thus serendipitously finds the spice and the punched pattern. The user can then enjoy their coffee featuring a visually appealing and aromatic latte art. We present a descriptive account on how we brought Stardust into being and contribute ideas for integrating art based multisensory experiences in mundane activities.",

      "abstract": "Mind-wandering (MW) and fidgeting are both present as pervasive phenomena in everyday life and can positively impact ideation. Importantly, within the MW experience, MW can manifest in bodily behaviors such as physical fidgeting. Here, we use an extended mind framework to consider fidgeting as a case of extended MW, where (part of) a MW episode is mediated by a fidget object. We position extended MW, fidgeting, and cognition as interrelated processes. We present the design of an interactive haptic fidget object that aims to support introspective self-awareness in MW and aid in idea synthesis. We discuss the results of an exploratory user evaluation in which the fidget object was used by designers during a personally relevant work session combining research, synthesis, and creativity. We close this paper by discussing the initial findings of our research, the implications for extended MW, and additional propositions for future research directions.",

      "abstract": "This demonstration presents Echo Mask, an interactive inflated mask that examines how digital devices could mediate rumination by reducing the meaning of thoughts. The user repeats into the Echo Mask a phrase as they hold the mask in a specific shape. A machine learning model associates the shape with the sound segment. As the user moves, the device produces a mixed, chaotic playback while the shape of the mask shifts and its machine learning system loses its certainty. Through repetition, distortion, and playback, the focus of the user is brought to the sound instead of the meaning of the thoughts. We share a detailed interaction scenario and design reflections to engage readers with the concepts behind this experience. The device illustrates the ability of digital devices to participate in rumination and suggests a design approach that could enhance our experience of the here and now. ",

By utilizing a mix of a top-down and bottom-up approach, we seek to understand embodied co-creativity in an improvisational dance setting to better develop the design of the modular AI agent to creatively collaborate with a dancer. The purpose of this demonstration is to describe the five-module agent design and investigate how we can design an immersive experience that is design-efficient, portable, light, and duo-user participation. Through this installation in an imitated black box space, audience members and dancers engage in an immersive co-creative dance experience, inspiring discussion on the limitless applications of dance and technology in the realms of learning, training, and creativity.",

In this workshop, we will focus specifically on how artist residencies are addressing (or not addressing) the challenges that artists, craftspeople, and/or independent designers face when collaborating with researchers affiliated with DIS. By focusing on the question ``what is mutual benefit?'', this workshop seeks to combine the perspectives of artists and academic researchers who collaborate with artists (through residencies or other forms of sustained collaboration) to (1) reflect on benefits or deficiencies in what the residency research model is currently doing and (2) generate resources for our community to effectively structure and evaluate our methods of collaboration with artists. Our hope is to provide recognition of the research contributions of artists and pathways for equitable inclusion of artists as a first step towards broader infrastructural change. ",

An augmented reality mobile app for smartphones uses image recognition of the record's center labels and printed double-sided coasters to replay a virtual dance performance with avatars animated by motion-captured performances. An antique record cabinet retrofit with upcycled modern electronics also houses a laptop, motion tracking camera and webcam aimed at the vinyl surface, which allows people to interact or perform live atop the vinyl themselves, observed on the projection behind the player. The work combines retro-analog and emerging technologies to explore memory, isolation, queer futurism and nostalgia as a tool for resilience while experimenting with what a record of dance is and can be.",

However, prior work has different conceptualizations of resilience, tackles resilience at different scales, and focuses on re- silience as the ability to adapt to adversity. This one-day workshop will bring together HCI researchers, interaction designers, health- care professionals, healthcare service users, and carepartners to critically reflect upon the epistemological stances on resilience and foreground the notion of resilience in health and wellbeing research. Our workshop themes include: 1) reflecting upon the diverse con- ceptualizations of resilience; 2) designing for resilience from a social justice perspective; 3) designing for multi-stakeholder resilience for individuals, families, communities, and society.\r\n",

However, the mobile phone adoption experiences of blind and low vision (BLV) older adults have largely been unexplored. We shed light on the socio-technical aspects of mobile phone adoption based on deep qualitative interviews with five BLV adults aged 60 and above. We found that narratives of smartphone accessibility can be misleading, expert knowledge is needed although scarce, and although smartphones increase access to society, using a smartphone with accessibility features for BLV people can be isolating. We present design implications for smartphones in order to improve shared access to the phone environment and to support inclusion and independent learning following smartphone adoption.",

We invite those interested from all professional and religious/spiritual backgrounds to imagine and design tangible interactive artifacts for religious or spiritual purposes such as beliefs, practices, or rituals. The workshop will include the demonstration of (imagined) artifacts, reflection on designing for religious/spiritual purposes, and hands-on design sessions.",

Current technologies mediate and monetize the construct of time which is constantly enforced upon us as experiences of acceleration, productivity, and linear progression as its dominant purpose. This design research takes a postphenomenological view by exploring the mediation of time through the speculative design of an interactive hourglass. The work investigates through the hourglass the possibility of co-shaping temporality and possible reframing of the perceived standards of time. This investigation is intended to help understand potential multiplicities in the mediation of time while also exploring other possible human-artifact-world relations.",

These underlying conditions make it difficult for patients and healthcare providers to prioritize the treatment of the underlying diseases and hair loss management.We are yet to see technological interventions designed to help these patients manage their hair fall improvement journey. Here, we explored the barriers to hair fall management and strategies people with hair fall use to manage their hair fall. We designed a mobile application to help people with hair fall continuously track and report their hair fall progress. Sharing hair fall progress data would enable healthcare providers to see the impact of ongoing treatment on hair fall and change their treatment routine accordingly. We then provide design recommendations for future HCI researchers looking to support similar problems.",

Generative technologies are developing rapidly and many designers are using them. Yet, there remains little published work on the use of GenAI in design. Our goal is to not only showcase the potential of GenAI for design, but to engage in discussions of its shortcomings and opportunities as they have been already articulated by scholars. By synthesizing both published and unpublished works, we will develop best practices, ethical considerations, and future research directions for the use of GenAI in design. We will explore a range of topics and themes, including leveraging the characteristics of GenAI for design, mapping the diverse applications of GenAI in design, envisioning a framework for design, and guiding future work on GenAI in design research. Ultimately, we hope to provide a roadmap for the integration of GenAI into the design research process and to encourage designers and researchers to explore the potential of GenAI in a thoughtful and deliberate way.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Human-centered design (HCD) shaped our thinking for the past decade. However, this methodology risks negating non-human actors in design proposals. The current theoretical discourse in HCI questions this anthropocentric worldview and explores the potentialities of incorporating more-than-human perspectives in design processes. Yet, we have relatively few concrete methods for engaging with more-than-human actors and decentering human perspectives. Therefore, we propose a methodology beyond HCD to explore “more-than-human” perspectives in design. This methodology utilises Uexküll’s concept of “Umwelt” as a guiding notion and integrates it into a methodology where creatively visualising overlapping Umwelts lead to moments of decentering. By doing so, we aim to transform design processes to create more inclusive and sustainable design interventions which consider our interconnectedness with the more-than-human world and the consequences for our planet.",

      "abstract": "Xenoforms is an interdisciplinary work that integrates the areas of artificial intelligence, robotics, synthetic biotechnologies, and architecture, with the purpose of reflecting on machine agency and the computational colonization of the physical space. Xenoforms are machine-generated synthetic prototypes intended to act as speculative augmentation entities that mutate, expand and take full control of an architectural host, mirroring colonization strategies mainly observed in the practices of parasitic organisms. The work features a robotic A.I. agent that acts as a laboratory researcher pursuing a never-ending quest for identifying the form and properties of the fittest synthetic candidate, one that will successfully achieve architectural augmentation. This installation highlights the anticipated moment when computational systems define self-established goals and motivations and asks us to consider the symbiotic conditions that are expected to be formed between physical objects, biological organisms, synthetic technologies, and artificially-intelligent entities.",

However, the sociotechnical aspects of the passengers’ experience have not yet been investigated despite its significance. To address this gap, we conducted an empirical study in Shucle, a ride-pooling MoD service piloted in South Korea. Drawing on our interview with eight Shucle users, we explore the existing passengers’ experience in this context. Our initial findings revealed that passengers faced personal losses in terms of unpredictability and uncontrollability owing to the algorithmic decision-making that coordinates the sharing of the tool as transportation. We then discuss important issues to be considered for human-centered design in the context of passengers with different goals and interests sharing a real-time algorithm-based ride-pooling service.\r\n",

RIR allows refining and validating the design of translational tools through exhaustive rapid iterations on several versions of tools. To demonstrate RIR, we present a study of translational design cards in the context of societal resilience with 14 participants. In the paper, we share our study experience, challenges, and lessons learned in conducting the RIR method. Reflecting on our experience, we provide recommendations on various aspects of the method, such as onboarding, activity design, card interactions, schedule management, data collection and analysis, and decision-making processes. We hope our study experience and recommendations open doors for researchers to use the RIR method for designing translational tools for diverse design spaces.",

The novelty of the proposed approach comes from the seamless integration of physical pigments into the painting planning process, achieving adaptive paint mixing during the painting process. Our approach does not require specialized equipment beyond a robot arm and a camera, providing broad opportunities for public and educational usage. This demo aims to upgrade the virtual, pixel-based experience of AI-supported art to a real-world tangible, creative experience. Participants engage in the process both by providing input for the robot such as images, text prompts, or audio, and also by providing physical selections of pigment for the robot. We hope that this demo motivates attendees to work on more systems that can support and augment human creativity. ",

      "abstract": "Here we present a playful installation that will allow DIS attendees to (literally) walk through the data produced during a situated design research study where we explored how to design technology for joyful and caring human-nature interactions. Our study unfolded as a one-month backpacking adventure where a researcher engaged 200+ backpackers from 35+ nationalities. While hiking, the researcher co-experienced the nature with other nature-goers, facilitated discussions on the human-nature-technology interplay, and co-imagined how future innovations might make that interplay more joyful and caring. He documented those radically situated engagements in different ways, including quick drawings and short writings, a reflexive notebook, Instagram stories, or photos and videos, among others. Our installation will allow DIS attendees to navigate those data in a way that is both playful, situated, and inspirational – putting themselves into the researcher’s boots and getting a more intimate sense of both how the study felt and what it yielded.",

HCI community has increasingly examined ways to support caregivers, but the solutions mostly focus on the negative emotions of caregivers. Informal caregivers go through a range of emotional experiences, both positive and negative. In this dissertation work, I aim to understand the emotional work of informal caregivers and how AI systems can be better designed to support this work. I start with conducting user studies and interviews to understand the valence and intensity of emotions in caregiving work and how this affects the caregiving burden. Then, I plan to use the Emotion Practice Theory to understand the complex emotional work from studies 1 and 2 through parts that AI systems can help caregivers with. This dissertation aims to provide a framework for designing AI systems to support the emotional work of informal caregivers.",

I work with gardeners of private home gardens because the garden is a place to observe shifts in our natural surroundings caused by anthropogenic climate change, and many gardeners have begun to treat gardens as biodiversity hotspots. To explore human-nature relations in the garden, I draw from phenology, the observation and study of the timings of cyclic biological occurrences.  In my first study I used cultural probes to explore what gardeners notice in their surroundings, identifying key human-nature relations (emotional, climate, personal historic, multisensory, global). I subsequently used these insights in my second study through co-design fiction workshops with gardeners to imagine future technologies that support sustainability in and from the garden. Based on the findings, I have presented three design spaces: community building through awareness and collaboration, multispecies care, and creating balance from the garden to society. The DC will be helpful to discuss these design spaces with consortium members to help shape a strong final study.",

The haptic cues reflect a plant’s “comfort” level based on proximal environmental conditions, aiming to increase awareness and induce feelings of closeness, symbiosis, and empathy with the user’s natural environment. Composed of inflatable silicone and non-elastic textile layers, NugiTex responds to nearby atmospheric conditions such as temperature and humidity levels, which are measured in real-time by AirSpec, smart eyeglasses fitted with sensors to collect environmental data. Variations in temperature and humidity in a room are then interpreted and translated into three types of haptic cues - shrinking, hard pushing, and mild pushing - each a metaphorical representation of the plant’s condition. Users are given these real-time haptic cues through FlowIO, a pneumatic platform for controlling the airflow and pressure of soft devices. We predict that the increase in awareness of natural entities through interactive embodied experiences will promote the Inclusion of Nature in Self (INS), and encourage pro-environmental behaviors.

I plan to explore research goals by designing and creating an interactive system through a participatory design and co-speculation approach. The research prototype can be lived with blind people in their homes to support their experience of reminiscence. With reciprocity in mind, I aim to involve participants in exploring, designing and reflecting together in all stages of the proposed research.

      "abstract": "“Setting” is an artwork created by the author on site, and site-specifically, for DIS 2023. It comprises a concept, a mobile phone app written as an interactive, sound-making website, and a group of five performers who carry the mobile phones through an outdoor site adjacent to the conference venue, thereby distributing the emitted sound texture in public space. The performers are subjected to the algorithmic decisions that the app communicates to them, but at the same time they also control the app. The interaction system is based on feedback and the repurposing of technological sounds that are distributed outdoors. The performance repurposes the everyday mobile phone use into an interactive arts piece, thereby questioning our human relationship to our surroundings as it is mediated through, by, and with technology. The performance is then mediated into the arts gallery, where the notion of time, as perceived through technology, is challenged. The piece “Setting” makes a contribution to asking about the resilient use of everyday technology in an outdoor situation.",

      "abstract": "Recently, subdomains of Human-Computer interaction (HCI), such as Tangible Interfaces and Haptics, have experienced disruptive hardware transformations owing to advances in Soft Robotics and Programmable Materials.\r\nHow will these fields shape the future of HCI over the next decade and beyond? Unfortunately, the transfer of fundamental advances from basic science to end-user experiences can take years due to many interdisciplinary challenges. These include challenges related to fabrication methods, durability, tools, access to resources, and transfer of knowledge. How can we most effectively overcome such challenges, what opportunities exist to accelerate progress, and what application possibilities can we envision and contribute to the future? We aim for a comprehensive approach to soft robotics design and fabrication and concepts of future applications for their integration into daily life. This workshop invites to explore how programmable materials develop new streams of HCI at the intersection of technology, design, art, and innovation. ",

      "abstract": "Efforts to diversify the design of virtual assistants (VAs) are inspiring new work on voice as a factor of user experience (UX). One trajectory is voice agedness. The Computers are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm suggests that humanlike computer agents are perceived in line with models of people. Notably, work on ageism and similarity attraction theory would predict that agents with “younger” and “older” voices may be treated differently. As a first effort, we explored the UX of a novel “older adult” text-to-speech (TTS) system. Younger (n=16) and older (n=18) people evaluated a VA that switched voices (“young” and “old”) in a storytelling activity. While most preferred the VA’s younger-sounding voices on most measures, all tended to rate the “elder” VA as more appropriate within the storytelling context, challenging expectations based on similarity-attractiveness theory. This work provides initial clues about the relationship between age characteristics and age stereotypes for voice UX.",

Through scenarios like planting, this framework suggests a new paradigm for mutual influence that allows users to impact communities' political decisions. Sixteen participants in the first round of interviews were involved in the framework's creation. Then we developed and implemented our framework in the community with the help of other stakeholders. This proof-of-concept creates user groups using information from users' daily activities as input and grows the green plants in a virtual environment. Finally, we involved AI agents and stakeholders in the framework test and iterations. Our study's user evaluation of a few key stakeholders demonstrates how our strategy enhances user viscosity and experience. Via human-planting ecosystems in a virtual community, this research gives a fresh viewpoint on decentralized governance and an engaging method for co-creating interactive ecological communities.",

The automated typewriter recognizes your speech and translates it into Morse code, excluding the words 'I' and 'you' and those letters. It creates a new perception of distance and captures the moment of losing authority over your own thoughts. Even if you see the typewriter transcribing what you just said with Morse code, the resulting sentences composed of dots, dashes, 'I', and 'You' on the paper seem to respond to your speech with a completely new and seemingly encrypted meaning, as if they are talking back to you. This can result in the loss of the speaker's original intention and can also represent the ephemeral aspect of either inner or outer voice.",

The work’s interactive design amplifies collective action and individual agency through a shared exploration of natural materials, resonance, and embodiment inspired by the Earth’s hydrosphere. It takes its name from the piles of rubble, wood, or caisson offering a first line of defense against shoreline erosion in coastal areas. Those breakwater forms, and especially their distributed structures, provide a biomimetic model for its interactive design. Performers and participants explore the sonorous properties of sand, wood, and paper while specialized piezo sensors and custom software process and broadcast an assemblage of sonic textures. The soundscape features repetition and contrapuntal patterns driving the non-linear experience. This case study outlines key design choices and conceptual undercurrents. It provides insight into the work’s ensemble devising methods and influences from social justice movement work. Participants find resilience in patience, fortitude, and shared memory; they find each other in the whispers between the noise.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning systems can help humans to make decisions by providing decision suggestions (i.e., a label for a datapoint). However, individual datapoints do not always provide enough clear evidence to make confident suggestions. Although methods exist that enable systems to identify those datapoints and subsequently abstain from suggesting a label, it remains unclear how users would react to such system behavior. This paper presents first findings from a user study on systems that do or do not abstain from labeling ambiguous datapoints. Our results show that label suggestions on ambiguous datapoints bear a high risk of unconsciously influencing the users' decisions, even toward incorrect ones. Furthermore, participants perceived a system that abstains from labeling uncertain datapoints as equally competent and trustworthy as a system that delivers label suggestions for all datapoints. Consequently, if abstaining does not impair a system's credibility, it can be a useful mechanism to increase decision quality.",

We reviewed videos of 19 pediatric resuscitations from the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, finding that PPE violations were associated with specific phases in the patient care process (e.g., before patient arrival), specific tasks (e.g., medication preparation), and specific locations (e.g., at the room entrance, bedside). Our results to date have suggested that alert design will require considering the urgency of correcting PPE violations vs. the urgency of the task being performed. We conclude by discussing our initial observations and the next steps.",

Inspired by the idea of a \"Wunderkammer\", a concept from the Renaissance and Baroque periods as a representation of a microcosm of the world, this artwork incorporates a contemporary cabinet of curiosities with AI-generated content of other forms of existence and expands the current Metaverse paradigm including emphasizing algorithm energy sound and rhythm. The research-creation process includes storytelling, object creation, virtual environment design, sound creation, and image enhancement, blending the esthetics of the obtained results with the tools used for the creation. Understanding and interacting with AI as a creative partner opens up new possibilities for future research-creation, both for the research part in providing collective knowledge as for the creation part to propose a machine-thinking inspired recombination of ideas. Resilience is not only achieved by how we respond to bad things, but also how we broaden our possibilities.",

These sensor-based technologies measure physiological processes including heart rate, breathing, skin conductance, brain activity and more. Researchers are exploring biosensing from perspectives including: engineering, human-computer interaction, medicine, mental health, consumer products, and interactive art. These technologies can enhance our interactions allowing connection to our bodies and others around us across diverse application areas. However, designing with biosignals in Human-Computer Interaction presents new challenges pertaining to User Experience, Input/Output, interpretation of signals, representation, and ethics. There is an urgent need to build a scholarly community that includes the diverse perspectives of researchers, designers, industry practitioners and policymakers. The goal of this workshop is to leverage the knowledge of this community aiming to map out the research landscape of emerging challenges and opportunities, and to build a research agenda for future directions.",

      "abstract": "Documentary filmmaking is inherently subjective. The filmmaking team decides when to film, how to angle the camera, how to edit, and what narrative to put forward. At the same time, documentary filmmaking has a capacity for sharing people’s experiences, expressing emotion, and foregrounding context through image, sound, and movement. In this paper, we discuss the tensions with using documentary filmmaking as a method for documentation as well as dissemination in design research. We present our approach to creating a series of 12 documentary shorts in the context of the Inner Ear project. The Inner Ear is a data physicalization project that invites participants to capture vibrations in their homes, which are then materialized as porcelain sculptures. We articulate the pressures and uncertainties of filming, and the responsibility of building narrative through editing. Finally, we discuss the generative but conflicting goals of combining research documentation with public dissemination via documentary filmmaking.   ",

      "abstract": "Exercise benefits people not only in physical health but also in mental health. Compared to individual workouts, many people prefer group exercise because of the additional peer support like guidance from experienced peers, and socializing benefits like the opportunities to meet new friends when exercising with others as a group. However, during the pandemic, many group exercise sessions were shifted from in-person to online through video conferencing platforms. Such change significantly decreased the exercise feedback and social signals that participants could receive during the exercise, such as the immediate self-checking with a studio mirror, the group movement calibration with co-exercisers, and the sense of social presence (i.e., the existence of other co-exercisers) in the small community. To address these challenges, we present ZoombaTogether, a video platform add-on that enhances the remote Zumba dancing experience with on-the-fly pose detection and visualization techniques. It tracks and evaluates how well remote dancers follow the instructor with minor latency and provide them with visual feedback to simulate a joint exercise experience with group members. ZoombaTogether visualizes the participants' performance at both individual and group levels to help them understand their movement similarity to the instructor and other dancers with a set of extensible visualization modules. Meanwhile, ZoombaTogether addresses the participants' privacy concerns by supporting on-device computer vision-based body posture estimation so that they could keep their personal video private from other group members. In this work, we provide a solution to use visual feedback as a communication channel for exercise participants and demonstrate the possibility of enhancing the online group exercise experience. We encourage the community to carry on our work and explore solutions to the challenges of missing social signals in online group exercises.",

Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can aid in decision-making, but HCI issues have reduced their adoption and effectiveness. In my dissertation work, I will design and evaluate a CDSS to support clinicians in treating patients with life-threatening injuries during trauma resuscitation. I will examine how the CDSS can obtain the data needed to recommend interventions and communicate the recommendations to the clinical team. In my preliminary research, I examined manual and automatic approaches to capturing the data needed for decision support. I also investigated the information that should be communicated to the team to assist in decision-making. My next steps focus on evaluating the effects of decision support on clinical decision-making. From this work, I plan to contribute a framework for designing CDSSs used during team-based, time-critical medical events. ",

As people experience transitions and different stages to their life, their needs, priorities, and goals change. However, people often face challenges with applying these changes to their personal informatics tools. This research investigates how personal informatics tools can support changing goals through ethnographic studies, the design and development of tools, and evaluation of these tools. This contributes to the understanding how personal informatics can support long-term goal setting.",

However, with Head-Mounted Displays (HMD), VR is often isolated from reality, which might hinder interactions with the real world. In this paper, we explore whether the combination of VR and ubiquitous computing can help overcome this limitation. We call this paradigm Extended VR. To exemplify the paradigm, we present ReViveLand, a VR system for enhancing real-world engagement where we personalize the VR environment based on the pervasive collection and analysis of users’ daily health and behavioral data. With ReViveLand, we hope to extend VR experiences to the physical world and also empower users’ real-world engagement to benefit their mental health. Ultimately, we hope our work could inspire HCI researchers to further consider how a combination of virtual reality and ubiquitous computing might expand the current interactive experiences.",

My work adds to recent trends in sustainable HCI (SHCI) which uses posthuman theories to understand and intervene in The Anthropocene Era and impacts of climate change. In my dissertation research, I explore posthuman framings of environmental sustainability HCI by asking how data mediates relations between bodies and land using cases and embodied orientations which push the posthuman agenda to intersect with social justice. Through explorations of situated bodies in place, I ask how data practices bring people into relationship with land in more or less sustainable ways. I use race and queerness as critical embodied orientations to land and water histories which interrogate climate changed futures in the Midwestern United States.",

Following a surge of criticism on traditional consequentialist, value- and principle-based suggestions, recent studies have turned towards relational ethics as a promising alternative to capture the messy, complex, and fluid characteristics of moral considerations in technical systems. This project follows these approaches, seeking to prototype new methods of ethics-as-practice for design practices of data driven technologies. I use sociotechnical imaginaries as a means of constructing alternative futures which position ethics as a contextual, situated doing, inherently embedded in design practice. Through this combination of relational ethics and sociotechnical imaginaries I seek to develop a conceptual framework that enables designers to engage with the ethical dimensions of their work productively and intentionally in practice.",

The root is our collective and individual attraction to and overly reliance on “ratio”, the ability of the mind for machine-like operations in simple systems; at the cost of “intellectus”, the ability the pick up on and reflect on what is important, and “formlessness”, the pure field of experience without thought which can sustain and grow intellectus. I activate and explore these in participatory design of infrastructure for nature connectedness. In the end, I hope to have contributed to proliferating understandings and inspirations for how nature connectedness can happen, the importance of nature connectedness, and how communities can be supported to practice and develop nature connectedness for themselves.

Based on the authors’ previous research exploring “alternative ways” of computation through food design, the Logic Bonbon is a liquid-centered dessert that “computes” its own flavor and presentation through hydrodynamically induced logic operations (AND, OR, and XOR), which form the basis of computation. This artwork serves as a material speculation, provoking a reimagining of the concept of \"resilience\" – the theme of this Art Exhibition – across the boundary between the “edible” and the “computable.” It envisions an innovative future for Human-Food Interaction (HFI) design by considering the material paradox between fragility and adaptability, ephemerality and durability, as well as palatability and computability.",

Our work involved a five-week co-creation process comprising twenty sessions, where forty-four participants collaborated with artists to craft four physical boxes representing \"Meaningful Places.\" These boxes were then transformed into immersive Virtual Reality (VR) environments, inviting the participants to engage with their creations in an entirely new way. The art installation during the DIS 2023 Art exhibition features the VR experience alongside the physical boxes our workshop participants created. With this, we invite viewers to step into the worlds imagined and crafted by those living with dementia, but also explore them in a celebration of the unique perspectives and experiences of those who made them.",

A typical phrase, along this line, would be social media user’s privacy concerns. The rise of content creation platforms such as Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok challenges this binary view through the platformization and commodification of content creation practices, leading to the situation where multiple stakeholder groups coexist and have different and sometimes competing perspectives, values, interests, and concerns. This workshop seeks to foreground the ‘multi-stakeholder’ nature in the study of privacy and safety in content creation, bringing together diverse researchers with similar interests and collectively envisioning emerging research agendas in this domain.",

This work explores how everyday objects' wear and tear might serve as an interface by leveraging patina's ability to semiotically communicate objects' physical memory. We focus on textile patina because of fabric's ubiquity, proximity to the body, and creative affordances (e.g., mending, sewing). Through our prototype of Pull It Together, a pocket whose surface actuates to modulate threadbareness, we discuss how artificial patina might enable designers to help users process invisible tensions (e.g., stress, unspoken needs). We developed distressed swatches with tangible animations to understand the medium's materiality, and conductive patches to help mend literal and emotional wear and tear. We propose applications of artificial patina that support dialogue around well-being, community solidarity, and creative practice, and present opportunities for translating everyday objects' sensory perspectives into ambient interfaces for reflection and communication.",

The discriminatory impacts of civic algorithms remain opaque to city inhabitants and experts alike. Current Explainable AI (XAI) approaches, while influential, are limited in their ability to explain the inequitable algorithmic spatial effects in an accessible, critical, and grounded manner. My thesis explores the potential of participatory mapping as a critical and collaborative technique to address these limits. My work draws on (1) scholarship on critical data and algorithmic studies, (2) qualitative research with domain experts from history and criminology, and (3) participatory mapping sessions with city residents and ML practitioners. Ultimately, my research will inform the design of a toolkit to help people in classrooms and community centers collaboratively reflect on how city residents may unevenly experience the impact of artificially intelligent systems guiding contemporary urban life.",

This research explores the use of 360° video as a specific technology for sustainability, as well as the sustainability of such technologies in academic research, through a series of case studies. These three cases studies can be taken together as a work of sustainable human-computer interaction as well as multi-sited, multimodal anthropology using research-creation as a method. This research addresses the overall question, How can anthropologists, media makers, and human-computer interaction scholars understand sustainability through their professional practices? This work contributes to the exploration of new technologies for cultural and environmental sustainability as well as to more sustainable technology lifecycles in academic research by examining systemic change at the university level.",

Scholars have previously described the ecologically-mediated nature of ethics in practice as a manifestation of \"ethical design complexity;\" however, the means of addressing this complexity is under-explored. In this provocation, we build on three years of prior empirical work on ethics and design practice to propose three ways of \"wrangling\" ethical design complexity: 1) articulating and interrogating complexity through constructed ethical dilemmas; 2) identifying potentially binding constraints through ethical tensions; and 3) describing and traversing naturalistically-defined ethical situations. We leverage these three approaches to provoke further scholarship and ethically-engaged design work.",

      "abstract": "While standalone Voice Assistants (VAs) are promising to support older adults’ daily routine and wellbeing management, onboarding and setting up these devices can be challenging. Although some older adults choose to seek assistance from technicians and adult children, easy set up processes that facilitate independent use are still critical, especially for those who do not have access to external resources. We aim to understand the older adults' experience while setting up commercially available voice-only and voice-first screen-based VAs. Rooted in participants observations and semi-structured interviews, we designed a within-subject study with 10 older adults using Amazon Echo Dot and Echo Show. We identified the values of the built-in touchscreen and the instruction documents, as well as the impact of form factors, and outline important directions to support older adult independence with VAs.",

      "abstract": "This proposal describes the design and demonstration of the Unlogical Instrument. This textile-based gesture-controlled sound interface invites the audience to generate sound by interacting with the textile using different gestures, such as poking, flicking, and patting. Unlogical is a statement about breaking the dogmatic approach of commonly used musical instruments. It brings resilience to the form of musical expression and interaction for the audience. It introduces an interactive mechanism mediated by intuitive human gestures and the curiosity to explore tangible material. Unlogical Instrument locates the focus on the textile. This artwork investigates the relationship between the gestures and the sound perception that originates from the textile through a material-driven approach. Inkjet printing is applied to transfer the original textile into a sensorial interface. The audience will listen to the sound while interacting with the textile surface, exploring and understanding this instrument through free-form playing. ",

We explore the design of a decision-support system for cases with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), a frequently performed life-saving intervention during trauma resuscitation. To better understand the current practices around making decisions about CPR and the types of systems that could support decision-making, we are conducting interviews with clinicians and reviewing videos of past resuscitations. In this work-in-progress, we discuss our preliminary findings, which include the types of computerized support envisioned by clinicians. We also discuss the design considerations that will inform our next steps as we continue this work.",

      "abstract": "Over the past few decades, human-computer interaction (HCI) and interaction design (IxD) scholars have embraced humanistic traditions to cultivate new modes of inquiry: widening examinations of technology’s social constitution, from affective computing, aesthetic interaction, and experience design to critical race theory, post-colonial computing, and “the more-than-human turn.” Today, with mounting political and environmental crises, scholars increasingly turn to humanistic inquiry to emphasize the necessity of both critical and imaginative encounters. This work often involves recognizing and reworking systemic inequities baked into the practices, policies, and governance structures associated with computing worlds. The goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together scholars, practitioners, and makers working across HCI and the humanities to develop a concern for the politics of imaginaries. We explore technopolitical imaginaries as the creative connections drawn between past, present, and future possibilities that shape computing development. Across discussions and hands-on activities, we seek to lay the foundation for a broader conversation on the stakes of a humanistic imagination and how HCI might learn from its optimisms without shying away from the necessity of its pessimisms.",

The collaborative visions were built into physical installed objects using recycled, organic, found materials from site-specific paradigms for physical exhibition as a form of human-AI collaboration. The outcome is a collaborative imagining of our climate future and our collective resilience and adaptions to this future from a technological and material perspective.",

In this systematic review, we evaluate literature (n=79) from 2014 to 2022 that has empirically described dark patterns in order to identify the presence, impact, or user experience of these patterns as they appear in digital systems. Based on our analysis, we identify key areas of current interest in evaluating dark patterns' context, presence, and impact; describe common disciplinary perspectives and framing concepts; characterize dominant methodologies; and outline opportunities for further methodological support and scholarship to empower scholars, designers, and regulators.",

Exhibition visitors will be visually listening to online participants’ stories via YouTube while “viewing” their stories on a live silent sound meter. Regardless of the messages from the stories, this project shows people’s cries and whispers about their hardships via the abstract visual representation. This silent sound installation is a significant interface to cope with our traumatic events in the post-pandemic era. Cries and Whispers Project is growing participatory art, which is anchored in different places to share diverse local stories with neighbors.",

The problem arising from monolingual ideology in technology is pronounced for individuals with limited digital literacy and English familiarity. We present a case study of two pairs of first-generation migrants and their children who completed a series of web and mobile-based tasks in their home language, English, and a different language.  We highlight the various roles the children played in helping their parents use technology and the ways in which the pairs moved between languages to seek and provide help.  We make a case to move away from monolingual ideologies in technology towards translanguaging, taking into account the rich language repository available to bilingual and multilingual users. We conclude by drawing three design considerations to nurture translanguaging practices in technology design. ",

      "abstract": "Movement forms the basis of our thoughts, emotions, and ways of being in the world. Informed by somaesthetics, we design for \"taking up space\" (e.g. encouraging expansive body movements), which may in turn alter our emotional experience. We demonstrate SoniSpace, an expressive movement interaction experience that uses movement sonification and visualization to encourage users to take up space with their body. We use a first-person design approach to embed qualities of awareness, exploration, and comfort into the sound and visual design to promote authentic and enjoyable movement expression regardless of prior movement experience. Preliminary results from 20 user experiences with the system show that users felt more comfortable with taking up space and with movement in general following the interaction. We discuss our findings about designing for somatically-focused movement interactions and directions for future work.",

The connected kettles allow individuals to visualise the state of a local grid and choose to use, store or push energy back to the grid, receiving or losing karma points according to the degree in which their actions contribute to balancing the state of a local grid. The points, however, fluctuate according to each player's profile, which is defined based on the UK Census for energy consumption, which breaks down energy expenditure by parameters such as income, ethnicity, region, and sex. Join us to understand opportunities and critical issues raised by these systems but be careful not to get into negative Karma!",

      "abstract": "Sustainability has never been more critical for DIS researchers. Within the DIS and HCI community, the term has multiple meanings: In sustainable HCI, it frequently refers to ecologically sustainable lifestyles through the design of interactive systems and to sustainability in HCI practice itself. Conversely, community-based HCI speaks of the sustainability of HCI, referring to the longevity of our socio-technical interventions. This workshop seeks to bring together these seemingly different conceptions of sustainability to explore their commonalities. Arguably, longevity is important for sustainable HCI, as is ecological impact for community-based HCI. We invite participants from diverse fields, such as sustainable HCI, HCI4D, Community-Based Participatory Design, and Digital Civics to reflect on past and current work, develop best practice recommendations, and design sustainability roadmaps to help researchers and designers to conceive, run, and evaluate future projects with sustainability through, in, and of HCI in mind.",

      "abstract": "The assignment of parcels of land affects many communal activi- ties, from voting to public school assignments. This process creates unease and often has a strong impact on communities. We propose Redistrict, an interactive web-based system designed to support redistricting deliberations for public school zoning. Redistrict helps community members explore and experiment with the possible con- sequences of various zoning scenarios. This point-and-click digital discovery activity allows the user to understand long-term impli- cations of proposed zonings and to provide feedback in an easy, intuitive way. By providing the opportunity for more people, indi- vidually or collectively, to look at the problem from different points of view, Redistrict promotes transparency, shared understanding, and cooperation. We designed Restrict to serve as a common in- formation space to help cultivate trust and enable communities to grow stronger, smarter, and more resilient.",

However, these generative AI applications lack clarity on how they work and operate for their users. Revealing how generative AI tools work enables designers to understand these tools’ limitations and capabilities. We developed a tangible interface with sand as a medium for human-AI co-creation and to extend the work in human-AI drawing practices beyond two-dimensional digital surfaces. Sand Playground is a co-creation interface that uses sand as the interaction medium. Sand playground has three co-drawing modes, artistic mimicry, zen garden and doodling. We conducted a user study with ten designers. We found that the interface enabled users to predict the AI agent’s actions. Our research introduces novel insights into the role of tangible interactions and physical interfaces in generative AI literacy and explainability in design tools.",

These include pictorial papers, video/audio documentaries, public exhibitions, posters and brochures, design fiction, comics, podcasts and many more. These alternative research outcomes play a critical role in explaining, disseminating, and translating valuable insights and knowledge from HCI research to people outside academic communities. We propose this workshop to initiate the conversation among researchers in the DIS community in generating alternative forms of research outcomes. What inspirations, motivations and critical factors influence the creation of alternative research outcomes? Who is the main audience, and what are the barriers and limitations of making them? The outcome of the workshop will be an enhanced understanding related to how HCI knowledge can be translated to or created for different audiences outside of academia, and a guide for HCI researchers towards creating alternate research outcomes.",

By using living and once-living media (e.g., fungi, plant and insect specimens, biodesigned artefacts) as starting points for investigating more-than-human temporalities, participants will discuss how a pluralistic temporal approach can offer to the discourse of designing-with nonhuman entities, and how this aligns with emerging HCI research trajectories and concerns.",
