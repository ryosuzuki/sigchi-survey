      "abstract": "Under the influence of global deforestation for consumer goods, not only complex ecosystems disappear, but also centuries-old indigenous culture and knowledge are constantly under a threat. Where in the West nature and culture are separated, they are inseparably one in Indigenous cultures. When a landscape disappears, so do the associated cultures, traditions and advanced knowledge of the natural world.\nRite Of Passage is Sébastien Robert’s second project of his research You’re no Bird of Paradise, which focuses on Indingeous music and rituals that are in danger of disappearing. Initiated in Chile in 2019, this project studies the influence of the Kultrun - a Mapuche drum - on the crystallisation of the Araucaria Araucana’s resin – a Mapuche sacred tree considered as living fossil – and explores the possibilities of preserving its ancestral rhythms in that medium. With his installation, Sébastien carries the patterns of the Kultrun and documents their influence on the formation of the crystals. This is being done using a technique called sensitive crystallisation that allows the formative forces of any organic material to be revealed pictorially.",

      "abstract": "In their foundational paper entitled 'Getting a Grip on Tangible\nInteraction', Hornecker and Buur develop a framework around four\nthemes.  Three of these - Tangible Manipulation, Spatial Interaction and\nEmbodied Facilitation - have become cornerstones of much work in the\nfield of TUI.  The fourth theme, Expressive Representation, has received\nless attention because it is predicated on the expectation that a TUI\ncan tangibly respond to the actions of a user, ideally in real time.  To\na great degree, this lack of attention is due to the fact that the\ntechnical challenges of actuating an object or surface so that it can\nrespond in a tangible way are non-trivial.  Furthermore, there is as yet\nno language of 'Expressive Representation' for tangible interaction that\nis equivalent to, say, animation for the visual modality.\n\nIn this talk, I will Draw upon our current work on the design of a\nfluid-actuated, bi-directional tactile display to suggest some fruitful\nstarting points that we might use to think about modes of Expressive\nRepresentation for tangibly responsive user interfaces.\n\nSile O'Modhrain is an associate professor at the University of Michigan\nwhere she holds a joint appointment in the Performing Arts Technology\n(PAT) program in the School of Music, Theatre and Dance, and in the\nschool of information.  Her research focuses on human-computer\ninteraction, especially interfaces incorporating haptic and auditory\nfeedback. She earned her master's degree in music technology from the\nUniversity of York and her PhD from Stanford University's Center for\nComputer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA). She has also worked as\na sound engineer and producer for BBC Network Radio. In 1994, she\nreceived a Fulbright scholarship, and went to Stanford to develop a\nprototype haptic interface augmenting graphical user interfaces for\nblind computer users.  For the past eight years, she has been working\nwith Brent Gillespie and Alex Russamanno to design and build a full-page\ntactile array to support the display of braille and tactile graphics.",

      "trackId": 11126,
      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "In interactive performance, kinesthetic empathy refers to the ability of performers to read, decode, and react to one another’s physical input. To develop kinesthetic empathy, performers rely on sonic, visual, and other sensory cues. Remote and interactive performance oftentimes limits these cues due to deficiencies of the virtual environment. In this case, performers must develop connections between alternate sensory modes to achieve kinesthetic empathy. This paper explores alternative systems for remote performance and investigates the ways in which human players creatively exploit these platforms to achieve kinesthetic empathy between remote participants. We present three examples of technologies and performance techniques used to achieve this connection that were employed in a variety of contexts during the summer of 2020.  Though each of the examples resulted in satisfying musical experiences for particular participants, they do not reflect a rigorous research process showing either qualitatively or quantitative the presence of kinesthetic empathy between participating musicians or between performer and audience in these remote environments.  Therefore we propose a plan for future research to gain more evidence that there is some embodied connection in these systems grounded in current research in the field of neuro-psychology and cognitive science.  \r\n",

Chinese paintings are characterized by a long history and implicit emotional expression, and it is challenging for non-professional visitors and foreigners to understand. To enhance visitors'  interest and comprehension of Chinese artworks, we design an EEG-based interactive installation. The installation simulates the process of accomplishing a painting. Visitors can control the generation of lines, colors, and movements of characters by wearing a commercial EEG headset. Our design contributes a novel experience of 'painting with your mind' and at the same time transform exhibits visiting into an enjoyable gaming.",

      "abstract": "We present “Plantimus”, an external sensory enhancement device that assists children to ‘hear’ plants. By embedding a digital layer on top of the physical world, we encourage children to step-out and reflect upon our inherent connection to nature as well as our responsibility towards it. Developing abstract thinking and self-exploration, the Plantimus is a two-piece device resembling a stethoscope, that generates different sounds when directed towards plants. The design process, as well as the technical implementation, are described in detail. Insights from the initial user testing are described, showing that children react positively to the experience of ‘hearing’ plants; and that the experience is also intriguing to adults. Future directions involve advancing the plant recognition method and the specificity of the plant-sound relationship and testing the device within new scenarios of use.",

Two equivalent representations of the same data set, one in physical form and one in VR, were created. Participants answered understanding questions while they had access to the model, and were subsequently asked about the data after the model was removed. We recorded time needed to answer understanding questions and correctness rates for recollection. The results favour the conclusion that the virtual representation significantly inhibits participants’ ability to work with the dataset. Reflecting on our study setup and participants’ comments, we discuss recommendations for future studies aiming at a systematic and comprehensive comparison of the differences in interacting with purely virtual and with physical data representations.

In previous studies, researchers contributing to people’s first impressions of technical artifacts focused mainly on visual attributes. However, their findings do not apply to visually impaired people who cannot visually explore technology. Hence, we assume that visually impaired people rather rely on their haptic perception to get a first impression. To examine how visually impaired people form their first impressions of technological products, we conducted an explorative study with three visually impaired participants. We asked them to evaluate haptic features of mobile phones and speakers using the repertory grid (RepGrid) method. This method can be applied in research fields at an early stage when no findings are available yet. To empower the participants to autonomously rate items, we used a haptic scale. We complemented qualitative results of the RepGrid technique with observations on how long participants explore technology as well as a following interview on first impressions. We found eight constructs which can serve as a basis for a quantitative evaluation on how devices make a haptic first impression.",

      "abstract": "This work-in-progress investigates the somaesthetic qualities of exploring posthuman strategies and relations with technology through casting soft robots directly onto the skin. Through a Research-through-Design process, a soft robotic prototype, Nautica, was developed based on embodied design ideation, autoethnographic bodystorming and prototyping in soft robotics. Nautica explores the concept of an embodied navigation system, that explores re-embodying the disembodied virtual body found in digital navigation systems. The Nautica prototype was tested directly on the designer-research’s body which led to discerning preliminary emergent properties. It was discovered that several “material” commonalities between the wearer and robot emerged over time due to the materiality and behavior of soft robots, which may bring to light new ways of experiencing hybrid somatic relations with technology. This work-in-progress ends on suggesting further work such as connecting the soft robot to a real, functioning navigation system, and to expand the testing of the Nautica prototype.",

We used a inexpensive FFF 3D printer, without any customization of the printer, to heat-seal and patterning different types of mono and multilayered thermoplastic bags. We characterized 8 different types of commonly-used product package's plastic film which are mostly made of polypropylene and polyethylene, and provided 3D printer settings for re-purposing each material. In addition to heat-sealing, we explored a new design space of using a 3D printer to create embossing, origami creases, and textures on thermoplastic bags, and demonstrate examples of applying this technique to create various materials for rapid design and prototyping. To validate the durability of the inflatables, we evaluated 9 different thermoplastic air pouches' heat-sealed bonding strength. Lastly, we show use-case scenarios of prototyping products and interface, and creating playful experience at home.",

      "abstract": "The development and widespread use of digital fabrication techniques has accelerated the fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) objects, enabling not only to design their shapes but also to customize their internal structures and materials to realize various functions. Here, we propose a design method to embed internal pumps and liquid paths inside 3D objects. We utilized the pump driven by electrohydrodynamics (EHD) of fluid migrating in response to an applied electric field. To arrange the EHD pumps and fluid paths in appropriate positions inside 3D objects, we stacked layered acrylic plates cut with digital fabrication tools such as laser cutters and cutting plotters. Using these embedded pumps, we can control the flow of fluid that can change color, shape, and motion of the objects. In this paper, we detailed our fabrication techniques named LayerPump, and demonstrated its design space and application scenarios.",

      "abstract": "AuxeticBreath is an interactive new-media installation that visualizes the rhythmic respiratory rate, as well as tidal volume - the amount of air displaced or exchanged in a single breath - of collective human breaths using soft robotics covered with auxetic structures (i.e. structures with a negative Poisson’s ratio, exhibiting the property of becoming thicker when stretched and narrower when compressed) [1]. The goals of this artwork are 1) to encourage audience interaction with collective breaths and user contemplation of the changing perception of respiration during the COVID-19 pandemic; and 2) to explore a new artistic approach using a combination of auxetic structures and soft robotics. The metaphors and artistic expressions of continuous inflation and deflation of elastomers, and the emission of light from the expansion of auxetic structures invite an individual's presence to become part of the larger collective installation, and to take a moment to consider underlying changing perceptions of breath during the pandemic. By employing an emerging technology, we want to encourage other artists to explore and modify techniques and methods generally only used among engineers, and to embrace them as new artistic approaches for realizing their own ideas.

      "abstract": "In the last decade, HCI research has proposed promising technologies for enabling shape-changing interfaces. Nevertheless, the usefulness and the user experience of shape-change are still to be explored and understood. This paper extends the understanding of both the utility and the usability of a cylindrical display that uses axisymmetric shape-change. Firstly, we present 16 use cases for axisymmetric shape-change resulting from brainstorming sessions. Secondly, we present a two-month comparative field study in the workplace. We asked six participants to shift energy consumption according to local energy forecasts by using energy storage. The results show that physical shape-change is as pragmatic but more hedonic than animations on a flat-screen. Shape-change seems to convey an endless fascination over time. Finally, we state the limitations and the lessons learned from this preliminary field study. Future work will extend to a six-month field study.",

      "abstract": "Our Swatch deals with the question of how a simple switch with different triggers can best be put into the context of e-textiles. It is quite easy to use and follows a sliding mechanism. With the help of a button, you make contact between different tracks. Depending on where the button is located, different actions are triggered. To make it easier to use, we have chosen 3 different LEDs, which light up when the button touches the respective track. The functionality of our invention can be used in different ways for practical purposes. The Slider can be applied to different types of textiles at any time and is hardly noticeable because of its minimalist and clear design. Nevertheless, it convinces with its functionality, because it allows for seamless integration of electronic circuits using elements already available in textile production.",

Taking this into consideration, this paper explores how we can upcycle and repair our clothes with e-textiles, and how to share these techniques with other makers and crafters. To do so the author interviewed 4 visible mending educators about their teaching practices and personal experiences with mending. These interviews were then used to inform the design of the E-Darning Sampler for the TEI 2021 swatchbook, which includes examples of different e-textile darning patterns and functionalities made with darning looms. This paper contributes insights on how to design educational samples for encouraging sustainable making practices.",

      "abstract": "The complexity of tasks and computations undertaken by machines has grown exponentially. In order to communicate these complexities to humans working with machines, these machines must be programmed to express themselves in forms that humans can understand, not merely with procedures and numbers, but with intentions, expressive gestures that communicate emotion, and interactions that form stories, all of which can be more intuitively grasped by humans. I explored machine gestures for communicating personality and narratives by building a “shy” lamp that looks away when humans gaze closely, and follows human faces when they’re far away. I followed by building a group of machines that all direct their gaze at the human unless she looks away, at which time they continue performing a skit. Artistic interventions with audiences shows playful interactions that depend on placement of the camera, showing a way of communicating machine personality using playful face-detection-based interactions.",

      "abstract": "The performative art installation is a rose uses plants as natural interfaces in order to establish a direct relation between natural and technological systems. The installation is used to visualize digital-physical interaction that is not necessarily explicit – triggered by touch or air movement, by direct and non-direct manipulation, depicting the sum of all interactions during the course of the day. The technical realization consists of detection of the movement of plants caused by the movements in their immediate vicinity and the subsequent deformation of a computer-generated sphere. The paper is explaining several different layers of meanings the artist was motivated by when developing the artwork.",

The display also includes a \"progress bar\" which fills up the more players collaborate musically, and to \"win\" the game, the progress bar must be full, initiating a multicolor light show for the players.

      "abstract": "Roads in You is an interactive biometric-data art and physical 3D data visualization by using a vein matching process to roads. Veins are beautifully complicated forms hidden under skins. It includes many intersections of roads that resemble the roads and paths surrounding us. In this artwork, participants scan their veins, capture the aesthetically formed vein lines, and observe existing roads in the earth that match to the veins inside of their bodies. The surprising results discovered through this process are visualized in both interactive 3D map visualization and 3D printed sculptures as personal souvenirs as a part of the artistic experience. Unique aspects such as artistic expression and situated metaphors in this artwork invite audiences to experience a unique matching process and discover newly meaningful roads for them. Enhanced 3D data visualization and physical data sculptures are new additions to this updated version. This data-driven artwork aims to find an interesting correlation between biometric data and map-based data in terms of research questions.",

      "abstract": "In augmented reality (AR), gesture/hand-based interactions are becoming more common place over tangible user interfaces (TUIs) and physical controllers. Major concerns regard portability and battery-life with TUIs and physical controllers in an AR environment. For a TUI or physical controller to be usable \"on the go\" and in the field, they need to be compact such that they can be easily deployable. Subsequently, it is desirable to be low-energy or powerless, such that the device remains functional after long periods. In this paper, we present our initial design towards a powerless, passive controller that leverages the optical camera of a AR head-mounted display (such as the Hololens or Magic Leap) for tracking. We discuss related work, design motivations, high and low fidelity designs, opportunistic/adaptable input modalities, and use cases. We conclude with propositions for future work. ",

      "abstract": "Hearing health is an emerging societal challenge, especially for older adults. Unidentified hearing loss can lead to social withdrawal, depression, and isolation. To improve public awareness of hearing health, we create an interactive testing device installed and operated in public spaces. While a user encountered the design unexpectedly, they could play around with it and get a report on their hearing. Compared to the audiometry testing, our system can generate reliable results with a high correlation of 0.78 on average to the standards. When we evaluated its user experience with 12 visitors in an art museum, it was positively recognized. Nature sounds used in the test provide a feeling of engagement and safety. Meanwhile, the visualization and printed results trigger discussions and reflections on the testing results. It shows the potentials in raising people’s awareness and providing early diagnostics on their hearing health.",

      "abstract": "We propose inDepth, a novel system that enables force-based interaction with objects beyond a physical barrier by using scalable force sensor modules. inDepth transforms a physical barrier (eg. glass showcase or 3D display) to a tangible input interface that enables users to interact with objects out of reach, by applying finger pressure on the barrier’s surface. To achieve this interaction, our system tracks the applied force as a directional vector by using three force sensors installed underneath the barrier. Meanwhile, our force-to-depth conversion algorithm translates force intensity into a spatial position along its direction beyond the barrier. Finally, the system executes various operations on objects in that position based on the type of application. In this paper, we introduce inDepth concept and its design space. We also demonstrate example applications, including selecting items in showcases and manipulating 3D rendered models.",

      "abstract": "Participatory design with wearable users entails engaging people in the design process from the early ideation phases. However, user-generated wearable concepts are often limited by the narrow design space of commercially available wearables. This paper presents an ideation scaffolding method we developed for eliciting wearable concepts, called Wearable Crazy Eights, where participants used an ideation deck and sketched up to 8 concepts in 8 minutes. Herein, we discuss the artifacts produced from our ideation method in a study with 46 participants comparing 3 groups. By comparing the 3 groups we were able to parse the effects of each activity on the resulting ideas. Our contribution is a replicable and customizable ideation method for encouraging outside-the-box thinking in wearable studies.",

      "abstract": "Animals in managed care ideally are provided with environmental stimuli for their psychological and physiological well-being. Most commonly, food-based enrichment methods are used to mimic wild conditions, allowing animals to search and forage. Other sensory stimulation devices may be employed to activate animal senses and reduce stereotypical behaviors. However, many of these devices fall short in providing choice and control to animals, an important factor in cognitive engagement. In this paper, we present a case study conducted at the San Diego Zoo that looks at the process of such embodied design for two elephants. We discuss the constraints and means to provide choice and control through our design. The resultant system, called Soundyssey, is an active auditory enrichment device for elephants that encourages play behaviors through embodied interaction. Our preliminary results indicate that elephants understood the system easily and interacted with the interface for a significantly longer time than passive objects around them. During the interactions, elephants showed more positive behaviors such as focus and exploration, reducing the possibility of negative stereotypical behaviors. We suggest that such technologically-enhanced objects and embodied design can enhance standards of managed animal care. ",

Through this, we propose the potential design of a pressure activated fibreglass skin for rigid and semi rigid fibreglass structures.

As such, this swatch explores 'undyeing' as a design process that utilizes light and dye as materials for controlled interaction. The swatch itself consists of a knitted cotton I-cord coated with silver doped titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2/Ag) and dyed with hibiscus. The I-cord is used to encase a strand of LEDs and was then continuously woven into a swatch. When the LEDs are turned on, the light activates the nanoparticles which in turn break down organic matter (the dye). This swatch provides a proof of concept for the undyeing process, which I believe could be an interesting area of future exploration for HCI researchers and artists alike.",

Cyborg Crafts blends techniques from the fiber arts with cyborg-inspired technologies (e.g., open-source biosensing EEG headsets and RFID implants). Second SKIN (Soft Keen INteraction), intended to support this practice, is a handmade collection of four modular soft wearable sensors with a temperature-dependent dynamic display. Each sensor has unique sensor-specific outer shell textures based on non-woven textile techniques, and each supports a different sense: momentary switch, pressure sensor, pinch sensor, and a gesture-detecting, capacitive touch sensor. The interactions of pressing, pinching, and touching are encouraged by sensor-specific extruded designs lending to finger placement. The outer shell textures are made from a mixture of flaxseed mucilage and silicone rubber. Thermochromic pigment additives endow display functionality to these passive devices through the application of heat in excess of 86°F.\r\n",

We use it in a somewhat similar manner to how conductive copper tape is often used for fast production of lo-fi electrical prototypes. However, copper tape has a number of drawbacks if one is prototyping with soft materials, textiles, or even directly on the human body. Because it is not elastic, it does not adhere well to such materials. Sports tape, however, has the desired elastic qualities, and additionally is designed to adhere not only to arbitrary objects, but also to human skin. We polymerize sports tape to make it conductive. The resulting conductive tape has a series of electrical properties which make it an exciting sensor-material. It is piezo-resistive. This means its resistance changes with applied forces. It can also be used to create a voltage gradient, which enables simple and precise position sensing. This unique combination of mechanical and electrical properties makes it an exciting and unique prototyping resource.",

      "abstract": "Detecting tangibles on capacitive touchscreen has seen vast attention over the past decade. Current state of the art allows a capacitive touchscreen to detect and identify a number of tangibles based on a unique footprint of interconnected conductive elements on the base of the tangible. In most cases, this conductive material is either metal or some carbon-based conductor, possibly integrated into a 3D-printing process. \r\nThe choice of conductive material is, however, not limited to these technical elements. \r\nIn this paper, we want to showcase how the concept of tangible detection on capacitive touchscreens can be transferred to pastry, creating an edible user interface. \r\nThe detection and identification of specific pieces of pastry open applications in the area of entertainment, but also food safety.",

      "abstract": "We present an overview and initial results from an interdisciplinary project bringing together orchestra conducting, e-textile material studies, costume tailoring, low power computing and machine learning (ML). We describe a wearable interactive system comprising of textile sensors embedded into a suit, low-power transmission and gesture recognition using creative computing tools. We further introduce observations made during the semi-participatory approach, which placed the conductor's movements and personal performative expressiveness at the centre for technical and conceptual development. The project is a two-month collaboration between the [removed for reviewing] Orchestra, designers, technical and design researchers, currently still running.\r\nPreliminary analyses of the data recorded while the conductor is wearing the prototype demonstrate that the developed system can be used to robustly decode a large number of conducting and performative movements.",

However, common stereo decks and mobile music player apps do not support these requirements well.\r\nWe present the design and architecture of our system, and a qualitative evaluation performed with 9 semi-professional instructors in their own dance classes. Dance instructors were involved in this project from the very beginning to match the system and interface design to its prospective use cases. Results show that instructors are able to use TempoWatch productively after only a short learning phase.",

      "abstract": "“Footsie” is an interactive kinetic art installation. It inspires to con- nect people through the counter-intuitive physical interaction that is mediated by flirtatious machines. It consists of a table and four robotic chairs; the chair legs carry the motion of “footsie” and arms caress the back of the participant. While it tackles the controversial culture and social norms on touching others body or being touched,an experimental bodily experience explores new aesthetic interac- tion between lonely human and a mischievous digital entity. The interaction is provocative in a slightly uncomfortable way, and the paradoxical feelings and stimulating sensations open simultane- ous interpretations on the meaning of Human-Machine-Interaction. Through nature inspired design like human spine, flexible muscle of mollusca and a caterpillar’s undulating wave motion, these pliable structures were fabricated with 3D printed meta-materials to create the sensual gestures.",

Even though previous HCI studies illustrated that design interventions could support more sustainable food practices in domestic contexts, little attention has been given to hospitality contexts (e.g. restaurants). Addressing this gap, we first investigated food preparation practices in restaurants (i.e. how recipes, menus and meals are prepared) through interviews with 10 chefs and instructors of culinary arts. Then, we designed KNOBIE, a design intervention aimed at supporting chefs’ sustainable food preparation practices through better recipe and menu planning. In this paper, we present the results of these interviews, KNOBIE as a concept to support sustainable recipe planning and how interviews guided its design.",

      "abstract": "Tactons are vibrotactile patterns used to convey information. Conventionally, a small set of tactons is used on mobile phone or wearables to notify users of messages or emails received. However, tactons have multiple characteristics that one can vary to design a multitude of vibrotactile patterns. In addition, one can place vibrotactile actuators on different body areas to leverage the spatial dimension and the varying skin sensitivity across the body. Prior work proposed methods to design tactons based on musical or engineering knowledge, but hands-on methods remain scarce. For this studio, we adopt a hands-on approach for composing tactons. We leverage a simple instrument-like device that consists of vibrotactile actuators connected to dedicated buttons for designing tactons. While pressing a button, the corresponding actuator vibrates. Users can vary several characteristics of the tactons (e.g., duration and amplitude), and experience them in real time during the design process by placing the actuators on the body. These tactons can then be shared with  other participants of the studio. Our goal with this studio is to observe users compose tactons collaboratively using a hands-on device, and better understand how they lay out the vibrotactile actuators on their body and what differences these layouts make in the tactile experience.",

      "abstract": "Since the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), researchers have asked how intelligent computing systems could interact with and relate to their users and their surroundings, leading to debates around issues of biased AI systems, ML black-box, user trust, user’s perception of control over the system, and system´s transparency, to name a few. All of these issues are related to how humans interact with AI or ML systems, through an interface which uses different interaction modalities. Prior studies address these issues from a variety of perspectives, spanning from understanding and framing the problems through ethics and Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspectives to finding effective technical solutions to the problems. But what is shared among almost all those efforts is an assumption that if systems can explain the how and why of their predictions, people will have a better perception of control and therefore will trust such systems more, and even can correct their shortcomings. This research field has been called Explainable AI (XAI). \r\n\r\nIn this studio proposal, we take stock on prior efforts in this area; however, we focus on using Tangible and Embodied Interaction (TEI) as an interaction modality for understanding ML. We note that the affordances of physical forms and their behaviors potentially can not only contribute to the explainability of ML systems, but also can contribute to an open environment for criticism. Our proposal seeks to both critique explainable ML terminology and to map the opportunities that TEI can offer to the HCI for designing more sustainable, graspable and just intelligent systems.",

Starting from the insights of two interactive soft toy projects, the authors explore interactive soft materials in designing for playfulness through a material-driven design approach. This can bring a new dimension in designing interaction for ludic experiences and reveal specific characteristics of soft materials. By combining somaesthetic and embodied design methods, the studio aims at exploring what makes soft materials playful. Moreover, it addresses how technology can enhance the playfulness of these materials and what kind of playful interaction scenarios can be imagined with interactive soft materials by involving the whole-body in the design process. The learnings from the studio will help the authors build a framework which shows the potential and describes the characteristics of interactive soft materials to create new tangible, embedded and embodied interactions for play.

      "abstract": "As immersive technologies are increasingly being adopted by artists, dancers and developers in their creative work, there is a demand for tools and methods to design compelling ways of embodied interaction within virtual environments. Interactive Machine Learning allows creators to quickly and easily implement movement interaction in their applications by performing examples of movement to train a machine learning model. A key aspect of this training is providing appropriate movement data features for a machine learning model to accurately characterise the movement then recognise it from incoming data. We explore methodologies that aim to support creators’ understanding of movement feature data in relation to machine learning models and ask how these models hold the potential to inform creators' understanding of their own movement. We propose a 5-day hackathon, bringing together artists, dancers and designers, to explore designing movement interaction and create prototypes using new interactive machine learning tool InteractML.",

The premise is that, by accessing detailed accounts of everyday experiences, we can obtain refined material for the design of interactive systems more connected with our bodies and emotions.  This TEI studio aims to introduce participants to the basis of phenomenologically grounded techniques in combination with the use of tangible materials as a way to articulate experience from the inner self, applied to the evaluation of existing technologies. This studio offers an alternative to assessment tools that rely on a predefined repertoire of feelings, to instead focus on emergent, complex and unclear aspects of our emotions. These strange collections of emotions -or felt senses- will be further explored through self-reporting tools and group exercises. ",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a Ph.D. research project on the affective relationships between users and wearable sleep-trackers. Sleep monitoring is a recent addition to wearable technology, computing in the intimate sphere of the body. Wearable devices interact with the human body often bypassing conscious thought and manipulating behaviours. The acceptance of sleep-trackers transforms the discourse of sleep from a passive, non-reflexive experience into an active, measurable performance. This produces a subjectivity of the sleeper who is affected by their device. The sleeping body becomes part of a network of sensing devices where human behaviour becomes operationalised. This exploratory research project aims to untangle the effects of sleep-tracking on the individual and the social. Through analysis of language and discourse this study aims to identify the human and non-human subjectivities such technology produces and the affective relationships between them.",

      "abstract": "The experience of aging differs vastly for men and women. For women, the often-slow transition that ends their reproductive capacity – menopause – closely relates to their experiences of aging. Menopause has a significant impact on the biological, psychological and social aspects of a woman’s life. While research suggests that education, guidance, and self-management techniques are beneficial for improving menopausal women’s health, longevity and quality of life, most women lack access to credible resources. Self-tracking technology offers women promising alternatives, but little has been designed to support menopausal women’s health. This doctoral research focuses on developing interactive self-tracking tools to help women access information about their menopausal journey, increase self-awareness of biological and psychological changes, and provide techniques to help adapt and manage their lifestyle. This paper outlines the process and plan for developing an ethnographic web application and an interactive wearable tracking device to help women better navigate their menopausal journey.",

This research is interdisciplinary in nature combining the fields of design, HCI and heritage; and the newly explored interaction methods will suggest new possibilities for the future of Tangible User Interfaces and augmented reality research in general and cultural heritage in particular. In the first year of my PhD, I developed a prototype that showcased a tangible interface to interact with augmented historical artefacts, and preliminary testing with experts yielded very positive results. In the second year, the research will investigate how different tangible interaction methods in augmented reality can promote realism and immersion and enhance the user experience.  ",

      "abstract": "“pheB,” is a robotic “plant-human, embodied, biofeedback” system to support the wellbeing of human inhabitants in confined, physical spaces. This surface aims to increase users’ emotion regulation and foster connections with nature by visualizing the internal states of plants through tactile, expressive movement. Unlike 2D biofeedback visualization models currently in use, our research explores mindfulness practices through immersive, tangible interactions to increase therapeutic effectiveness. This pictorial traces the development of our design (to-date) and presents results from an early user study conducted to (a) assess the prototype at leading breathing exercises, (b) evaluate preferences for different design features, and (c) refine the design of a questionnaire for future user testing. Findings suggest pheB was perceived positively and as an embodied extension of self during guided breathing exercises. This work contributes knowledge toward developing novel biofeedback modalities and offers a design exemplar for interactive artifacts that nurture meaningful relationships with nature. \r\n",

This paper describes a case study of running a wearable technology group project within a undergraduate course entitled Wearable Technology and Society. The computational media students in the class worked with outside performance artists (drag queens and a street dancer) collaborating to create interactive performance garments. Design methods such as the use of boundary objects aided in communication of ideas and cooperation across disciplines and cultural barriers. The urgency and gravity of the interactive garment having to function appropriately in a real performance acted as a motivator for cohesive and expeditated problem solving in the transdisciplinary group setting. The use of these methods on a project with real world outcomes and consequences facilitated an authentic learning experience for the students involved.",

      "abstract": "We introduce the term 'Art Digital Jewellery' as a label for craft-oriented, bespoke approaches to embedding electronics in jewellery. These unconventional digital-physical jewellery practices struggle for attention compared with higher profile, often more mass-production oriented wearables. This is partly because discourses articulating and critiquing these experimental practices are scarce and obscure to HCI researchers. To address this, we describe how these artistic practices arose from earlier fashion movements and we engaged six leading creative practitioners in a structured and iterative dialogue. Analysis of our adapted Delphi survey suggests that core to Art Digital Jewellery is very individualised design processes and creating artefacts which are highly personal in terms of their form, their materials, their narratives and their interactivity. An appreciation of these unique practices may enrich perspectives on designing wearables, marrying craft with technology, and personalisation of experiences.",

      "abstract": "Electronic prototyping is often facilitated by web-based tutorials and breadboards. Several virtual and hybrid platforms do exist, but each also with limitations. Integrating multiple sources of information when using breadboards can hinder learning by increasing cognitive load. The lack of physical interaction with electronic components or active feedback can further impede the process. To address this, we present three editions of PPCards, a card-based platform for prototyping electronic circuits overcoming limitations of existing paradigms. On a comparative evaluation, participants were faster at prototyping with the first edition as compared to web-based tutorials and underestimated the time taken to complete the prototyping tasks, as expected in reduced split-attention conditions. The second and third editions were rated positively on their ability to incorporate multimedia content and provide active feedback. A follow up discussion on split-attention effects and design considerations for future card-based tools to enhance user experience and learning has been added.",

However, students who encounter physical computing for the first time are typically not aware of the form factors and the potential for interaction of the various sensing and actuating possibilities. To complement existing touchpoints that these students have with physical computing, we present electronic smörgåsbords: boards that display collections of physical computing components that are available in-house in an organised and interactive way to support the initiation of interaction design projects. The deveploment of the boards allowed us to articulate four principles for their design, which are intended to inspire the development of future educational material.",

For the first time, we explore the use of focused ultrasound as a means of transferring power to a distal device, transforming passive props into dynamic active objects. We explore the ability to transfer power from an ultrasound array commonly used for mid-air haptic feedback and investigate the practical challenges of ultrasonic power transfer (e.g., receiving and rectifying energy from sound waves). We also explore the ability to power electronic components and multimodal actuators such as lights, speakers and motors. Finally, we describe exemplar wearable and tangible device prototypes that are activated by UltraPower, illustrating the potential applications of this novel technology.",

Responding to a call to challenge taken-for-granted design conceptualizations, we draw on interactive sound-based design in order to develop considerations for the body and physical environments within VR narratives. We propose that a focus on the actions the player is asked to perform (e.g., touch, stand, kneel, grasp, walk, listen, reach, dance) can contribute to an understanding of VR as a sensory, embodied medium that offers ways to playfully engage with physical reality rather than simulate it entirely.

      "abstract": "Mainstream communication technology today enables us to connect with loved ones across long distances. However even with the proliferation of easy-to-use technology, there are reports on increasing loneliness and isolation amongst people. The technologies that enable these interactions are not necessarily designed to support meaningful emotional communication for users in long-distance relationships (LDRs). Furthermore, there is a lack of participatory tools that are designed with the focus of supporting end-user involvement in the design of LDR communication systems. We developed the Flexi Card Game (FCG) – a card-based generative design toolkit to support designers and non-designers in participatory structures in the development of unconventional communication systems to support LDRs. The FCG was developed using an iterative design process, involving end-users, designers, and researchers across five workshops with 56 participants. The paper makes three main contributions: (1) presents FCG - the novel card-based design toolkit itself - available for download, (2) the process of developing a LDR framework into a participatory toolkit that engages end users, and (3) lessons and insights that can help researchers who are developing participatory tools in similar contexts.",

      "abstract": "New technologies for autism focus on the training of either social skills or motor skills, but not both. Such a dichotomy omits a wide range of joint action tasks that require the coordination of two persons (e.g. moving a heavy furniture). The training of these physical tasks performed in dyad has great potential to foster inclusiveness while having an impact on both social and motor skills. In this paper, we present the design of a tangible and virtual interactive system for the training of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in performing joint actions. The proposed system is composed of a virtual character projected onto a surface on which a tangible object is magnetized: both the user and the virtual character hold the object, thus simulating a joint action. Furthermore, we report and discuss preliminary results of a field training study, which shows the potential of the interactive system.",

      "abstract": "Supporting Practice-based vocational skills development in the classroom can be logistically challenging, however tangible interfaces present natural affordances for supporting such skill development. In the context of teaching stage lighting specifically, we present an open source toolkit based around \\textit{tangible hardware proxies} to support the teaching of practice-based skills. Our tangible proxies embody key configuration, interaction and optical properties of real stage equipment. Drawing on notions of representation and bi-directional digital-to-physical transformation, we design a toolkit that specifically supports a gradual transition between virtual, simulated and real equipment during the learning journey, and open the door to embedding stage craft into schools. Through reporting on deployments in two schools, we discuss the affordances of such proxies and their potential for supporting the teaching and learning of practice-based skills in the classroom.",

      "abstract": "Through experience, the techniques used by professional vocalists become highly ingrained and much of the fine muscular control needed for healthy singing is executed using well-refined mental imagery. In this paper, we provide a method for observing intention and embodied practice using surface electromyography (sEMG) to detect muscular activation, in particular with the laryngeal muscles. Through sensing the electrical neural impulses causing muscular contraction, sEMG provides a unique measurement of intention where other sensors reflect the results of movement. In this way, we are able to measure movement in preparation, vocalised singing, and in the use of imagery during mental rehearsal where no sound is produced. We present a circuit developed for use with the low voltage activations of the laryngeal muscles; in sonification of these activations, we further provide feedback for vocalists to investigate and experiment with their own intuitive movements and intentions for creative vocal practice.",

      "abstract": "In stage performances, the connections between audience and performers are often separated by the invisible fourth dimension wall. To amplify this performative connection, we present the concept \"Dancing to Your Beat\": streaming sensor data related to heart and electrodermal activities from audience members and integrating this data into staging elements, such as visual projections, music, and lighting. Thus, the audience‘s internal states are influencing the staging. The performers have a more direct perception of the audience's inner reactions and can create physical expressions in response to them. \r\nIn this paper, we present the wearable sensing system as well as design considerations mapping heart/electrodermal activity to staging element changes. The setup was evaluated over the course of three live performances.",

      "abstract": "Tangible toolkits enable individuals to explore concepts through combining components together and taking them apart. The strength and limitation of many e-textile toolkits is that threads hold them in place, and once put together they need destructive methods to take them apart. In this paper, we propose Punch-Sketching e-textiles, a drawing technique that uses a punch needle to iteratively prototype soft circuits. The benefits of this approach is its sustainability and reusability values where users can easily pull out circuits without damaging the materials or creating waste, while also testing out concepts using the actual threads that will be used in the final prototype. To validate our technique, we ran three studies comparing sewing and punching e-textiles through: 1) understanding the process with 2 fiber artists; 2) exploring the potential with 4 beginner users; and 3) utilizing our methods further with 7 occupational therapists. Insights from these 3 studies include when and how to use each method, toolkit recommendations, considerations for iterative physical prototyping, sustainability, and accessibility. ",

      "abstract": "Many existing explorations of wearables for HCI consider functionality first and wearability second. Typically, as the technologies, designs, and experiential understanding develops, attention can shift towards questions of deployment and wearability. To support this shift of focus we present a case study of the iterative design of electrode sleeves. We consider the design motivations and background that led to the existing, prototype EMS sleeves, and the resultant challenges around their wearability. Through our own design research practice, we seek to reveal design criteria towards wearability of such a sleeve, and provide designs that optimise for those criteria. We contribute (1) new electrode sleeve designs, which begin to make it practicable to take EMS beyond the lab, (2) new fabrication processes that support rapid production and personalisation, and (3) reflections on criteria for wearability across new eTextile garments.

Unfortunately, many design and usability challenges still exist with these technologies. We investigated current shortcomings and limitations through survey (N=105), interview (N=7), and participatory workshop (N=3) data collection methods. Our findings revealed issues with current technology including wear-ability and accessibility in public, operation while performing demanding tasks, interruptions during social activities, continuity of maintenance, and interface operations. Using the data from our investigative work, we produced design criteria to develop a novel wrist-worn interface and separate pump design for a closed loop system. We then evaluated the design through remote usability testing sessions (N=7) with insulin pump users. Our study aspires to inform the future design of novel insulin pumps that enable people with T1D to maintain better control of their glucose through consistent interactions with these tools, during their everyday activities.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Effective end-user privacy management in everyday ubiquitous computing environments requires giving users complex, contextual information about potential privacy breaches and enabling management of these breaches in a timely, engaging and intuitive manner. In this paper, we propose using empirically grounded image schema-based metaphors to help design these interactions. Results from our exploratory user study (N=22) demonstrate end users’ preferences for changes in physical attributes and spatial properties of objects for privacy awareness. For privacy control, end users prefer to exert force and create spatial movement. The study also explores user preferences for wearable vs ambient form-factors for manging privacy and concludes that a hybrid solution would work for more users across more contexts. We thus provide a combination of form factor preferences, and a focussed set of image schemas for designers to use in the design of metaphor-based tangible privacy management tools.",

      "abstract": "Softness is one of the most important factors in human tactile perception. With recent advances in 3D printing, there has been significant progress in fabricating compliant objects. However, existing methods typically remain inaccessible to end-users, mainly due to the separation between designing shapes and setting printing parameters to achieve desired softness, resulting from excluding softness specifications in early design processes. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we contribute an end-to-end design tool that takes a design-by-example approach: given a 3D model, a user can specify the region and a level of softness, by shopping everyday objects as a reference. The tool generates both geometry and 3D printing parameters to reproduce the desired softness, which can be achieved using commodity FDM printers and materials. We also provide a data-driven pipeline to enable other compliance modeling methods to begenerally used within our design tool. In two user studies, we demonstrated that users could easily locate existing reference objects’ softness to a 3D printed object. In a design session, end-users successfully used OmniSoft to design an object with augmented functions.",

Imagination then, is not a reflective activity an individual does by herself, but a shared and embodied activity scaffolded by tangible design. We present a case study in which we designed a toolkit to facilitate imagining the Netherlands in 2050. We wrote speculative stories of people living in 2050 and designed an assortment of objects. We held several workshops to use the toolkit for shared imagination for our client, Rijkswaterstaat. We analyse how, in the context of the workshops, the stories and objects provided affordances for shared imagination. We thereby hope to have demonstrated that it is possible to design for more intellectual activities in a tangible and embodied way.\r\n",

Studies have shown the potential these have to bring computational knowledge closer to new audiences. \r\nWe address how eTextiles can approach a traditional textile art, specifically “Arpilleras” from Chile, to understand how each field contributes from a symbolic, material, and technical perspective. Following participatory approach methods and STEAM guidelines to create an educational program,  we observed how eTextiles can influence the creation of soft interactive interfaces that enhance the communicative character and cultural heritage of a craft, and the potential of their use in a pedagogical context by using a specially designed kit. \r\nOur study suggests that connecting technologies with strong cultural identity craft can help to reach new audiences, revitalise the traditional technique, and create new tools for expression and creativity. \r\n",

      "abstract": "This paper argues that a significant paradigm change in contemporary dance can offer further opportunities for HCI researchers interested in embodied interaction and interactive system design. Based on the analysis of 42 HCI papers in our data set, resulting from searches in two computing research libraries, we suggest seven thematic categories that reflect how HCI researchers have been engaging with contemporary dance. Moreover, we propose a standardized usage of contemporary dance terminology in HCI literature, and discuss the current state of engagement with publications from the field of performance theory. We identify three opportunities for HCI, which can arise through further engagement with the knowledge produced in contemporary dance and performance: to engage with the field of embodied interaction from the perspective of performance research and theory; to employ contemporary dance methods and practices in HCI research; and to integrate contemporary dance choreographers and performers as researchers in interdisciplinary projects.",

      "abstract": "Home decor defines how people experience and share spaces, with the decorative elements forming the ‘interface’ to the home. Despite the opportunities of embedding technology within these elements, research to date has not explored this fully. This paper brings home decor to interaction design utilizing decorative elements as a vehicle to incorporate tangible interaction in domestic spaces. In an IKEA-like format, we designed a product catalogue of our own prototypes that illustrate the possibilities of the nearest future. These design illustrations should offer inspiration to those who wish to work with interactive materials (e.g. appearance-changing and soft-sensing), particularly in the context of interactive spaces. Through making, situating, and speculating, we show how designing interactive decor can be a promising area in Research-though-Design.",

      "abstract": "Digital tangible interfaces have been used to present or embed interactive stories for decades. While many researchers explored different ways of creating engaging  interactive  experiences,  they focused more on the novelty of the interface and the new experience it brought for users, rather than the exploration of tangible interfaces as a language, or a medium, for storytelling. Through a visual journey of our creative explorations, this pictorial reflects upon the design and making of Letters to José, a tangible narrative built during a three-year practice-led research project. Located in the intersection of tangible interaction design and interactive storytelling, our work characterizes the relationships between the artifact, other artifacts, the body, and the space with respect to supporting the narrative experience. The outcome is an annotated visual typology of artifacts for storytelling in the context of tangible narrative, as a design category and toolbox for researchers and creators of tangible stories.",

      "abstract": "Large-scale kinetic displays have been present for decades, both as mesmerising art installations and as information displays. In this paper we present KINEIN, a kinetic display whose large-scale and indefinite deployment time distinguish it from the prototypical level of HCI research artefacts. It consists of 625 “tiles” or “pixels” mounted on a 25 x 25 matrix and operates through mechanical movement. Instead of a motor rotating each tile individually, KINEIN has a vertical column system that moves tiles sequentially. Situated at the entrance of a learning environment, KINEIN is not only a playful artefact for children to physically interact with, but also the first encounter for the school’s visitors. We make use of the pictorial format to illustrate and contribute our Research-through-Design (RtD) process as well as its implications regarding large physical scale and indefinite deployment.",

      "abstract": "Interactive installations face several challenges when used in public or semi-public contexts, such as users not noticing interactivity, or refraining from interacting due to the fear of social embarrassment. Several interaction models proposing solutions to these issues have been established over the years. However, most of these models focus on single-surface installations, which have to be approached for interaction. When the users’ own devices (ODs) are included in the installation, though, the interaction focus shifts. To determine the influence of the ODs on the applicability of existing interaction models, we developed a multi-device quiz game, the “Weisskunig Quiz”, according to these models. The installation was deployed in a real museum exhibition and tested in two qualitative evaluations with random museum visitors and a school class. We describe our design approach, reflect on the found differences, and propose an extension for single-surface interaction models by incorporating the users’ own devices.",

      "abstract": "Walking meditation is a form of mindfulness training, where the act of walking provides a rhythmic meter for attentional focus. Numerous digital technologies have been created to support sitting meditation and walking practices, however, less explored is the influence of these technologies on the first person in-the-moment experience of walking meditation. In this paper, we present a study of group walking meditation, with and without an interactive soundscape that is modulated by one practitioner's brain wave data. In order to understand and design the interactive experience, we developed qualitative methods for data collection of the first person experience of walking meditation. Six workshops were conducted with both novice and more advanced practitioners, involving a guided walking meditation with body scan, structured writing and drawing exercises for elicitation and reflection, and a group interview. Our contribution is twofold: a descriptive model of the experience of walking meditation as represented by the analytic themes of shifting state, attention, self-regulation strategy, and immersion and reflection, together with body maps and experience timelines that visually represent patterns in the data; and a workbook comprising the set of phenomenologically inspired data collection methods, which helps participants articulate their first person experience and enhances their ability to reflect on the practice of walking meditation. The results provide insight into how practitioners divide and shift their attention between the rhythm of walking, breathing and the soundscape; and how some are able to harmonise the multiple dimensions towards a flow experience. Our study contributes to and provide resources for the experience design of interactive technologies to support mindfulness practices of walking meditation, as well as other practices where the mind/body experience is central.",

We focus on materialising the negative consequences associated with living far apart in a textile form, and manifest those in two pairs of wearable artefacts: first, WARMTH, which simulates the bodily distance between remote people through a decrease in felt temperature, and second, BREATH, which embodies the bodily absence of a remote other through a decline in mechanical movement of textiles. The wearables are ‘discussion artefacts’ that enable conversation about, reflection on and exchange of personal, negative, vulnerable and challenging emotions connected to living far apart. The stance taken in this pictorial emphasises the necessity to focus not only on overcoming and bridging the distance between remote people through interactive artefacts; but also, to consider and manifest melancholic and possibly negative personal experiences.",

      "abstract": "When digital applications aim to blend virtual and real worlds, understanding the actual physical actions of users becomes an important task, and the precise timing of these tangible interaction events is needed, along with the identity, and possibly location and history, of all involved actors/objects.  With multiple actors or objects, it is difficult to identify who touches which object and when. Instrumenting objects for Body Channel Communication (BCC) allows message exchange around the human body to directly notice touch events (and the identity of actors).  TangibleID is a framework that unifies tangible interaction capture for objects and users based on wearable BCC.  TangibleID provides identification and communication with tagged objects/users in less than 120~ms and supports a variety of tangible interactions, without the need to restrict user (hand) movements or to maintain line-of-sight connection to cameras.  When an AR application is combined with TangibleID, a new tangible mixed reality experience is achieved, as demonstrated in the ``Haunted Castle'' showcase.  The paper presents an end-to-end technical evaluation including trade-offs regarding robustness and speed of touch recognition, outlines the breadth of interaction modalities, and reports on an initial user assessment.",

The substantial growth in the field of functional apparel design, such as the use of smart textiles, encourages researchers and fashion designers to incorporate technology within their designs. In previous work e-textiles have required interdisciplinary knowledge such as electrical engineering and computer science to be successful. To help with this we created ready-to-use shape changing fabric samples for designers to assess how convenient it could be to implement emerging technologies into their designs. We explored this research gap through a preliminary user case study with seven experienced designers. Our results suggest design guidelines for shape changing fabric samples that would assist designers incorporating technology in their designs.",

      "abstract": "We present Seedmarkers, shape-independent topological markers that can be embedded in physical objects manufactured with common rapid-prototyping techniques. Many markers are optimized for technical performance while visual appearance or the feasibility of permanently merging marker and physical object is not considered. We give an overview of the aesthetic properties of a wide range of existing markers and conducted a short online survey to assess the perception of popular marker designs. Based on our findings we introduce our generation algorithm making use of weighted Voronoi diagrams for topological optimization. With our generator, Seedmarkers can be created from technical drawings during the design process to fill arbitrary shapes on any surface. Given dimensions and manufacturing constraints, different configurations for 3 or 6 degrees of freedom tracking are possible. We propose a set of application examples for shape-independent markers, including 3D-printed tangibles, laser cut plates and functional markers on printed circuit boards.",

      "abstract": "Assembling circuits is a challenging and time consuming activity for novice makers, frequently resulting in incorrect placements of wires and components into breadboards. This results in errors that are difficult to identify and debug, and delays that hinder creating, exploring or reconfiguring circuit layouts. This paper presents VirtualWire, a tool that allows users to rapidly design and modify circuits in software and have these changes instantiated in real-time as electrical connections on a physical breadboard. To achieve this, VirtualWire dynamically translates circuit design files into physical connections inside a hardware switching matrix, which handles wiring across breadboard rows and to/from an embedded Arduino. The user can interactively test, tune, and share different circuit layouts, and once satisfied, can fabricate the circuit on a permanent substrate. Quantitative and qualitative user studies demonstrate that VirtualWire significantly reduces the time taken for (by 37%), and the number of errors made during (by 53%) circuit assembly, while also supporting users in creating readable, space-efficient and flexible layouts.

Therefore, an aesthetic experience will always be perceived differently for every person and time. With our approach, we research the potential to define an adaptive physical aesthetic experience by the targeted EEG feedback of the perceiver.\r\n\r\nIn a series of three distinct projects, we use generative robotic control (KUKA|prc), a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network and electroencephalography (EEG), to create an aesthetic adaptation strategy within a physical parametric output space.\r\n\r\nThough certain physical limitations apply, the resulting artefact interaction offers the potential to make the aesthetic definition to a certain extend relational to individual perception and cognition processes and therefore to some extend adaptive to emotional, contextual as well as cultural change over time.",

      "abstract": "In the few decades since the first mainframe computers were built, computing technologies have grown smaller, and more pervasive, moving onto and even inside human bodies. Even as those bodies have received increased attention by scholars, designers, and technologists, the expectations and understandings of the body articulated by these technological artifacts have not been a focus of inquiry in the field. We conducted a feminist content analysis on select papers in the proceeding of the ACM International Conference on Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction (TEI) since its inception in 2007. Our analysis illustrates how artefacts are implicitly oriented on unmarked bodily norms, while technologies designed for non-normative bodies treat those as deviant and in need of correction. Subsequently, we derive a range of provocations focused on the material bodies in embodied interaction which offer a point of reflection and identify potentials for future work in the field.",

In this paper, we investigate if shape-adapting tools can also be used to improve motor-skill training. In contrast to static tools that remain at the same difficulty level, shape-adaptation can be used to vary the difficulty level to keep learners at the optimal challenge point where the task is neither too hard, nor too easy. \r\n\r\nTo investigate if shape-adaptation helps in motor-skill training, we built a prototype that works in three modes: (1) static, (2) manually-adaptive, and (3) auto-adaptive. For the auto-adaptive mode, we also developed an algorithm that adapts the difficulty level based on the optimal challenge point. Our two user studies show that the auto-adaptive mode provides significant learning gains when compared to the static [F(1,11)=1.856$, $p<0.05$] and manually-adaptive mode [F_(1,12)=2.23, p<0.05]. ",

In this workshop, students of a Bachelor program on Management by Design explained their thesis by visualizing and externalizing the problem space using everyday objects. The use of objects to represent and understand complex design problems is well documented in the fields of Design and Human-Computer Interaction, but is often researched in collocated settings. What happens when the design tools used to externalize and represent complex design problems are everyday household objects, and the discussion happens in a distributed, asynchronous manner? How is shared meaning negotiated and established? In this Pictorial, we discuss six pictures that were taken of the visual representations that the students constructed, and reflect upon the distributed, asynchronous process that was employed to create, develop, and agree upon meaning",

      "abstract": "Recommender algorithms play an active role in many everyday activities. However, personalized recommendations often produce negative experiences due to a lack of awareness, control, or transparency. Allowing users to materialize their algorithmic imaginaries exposes how they experience, perceive, and imagine recommender algorithms. Moreover, it can unearth novel and previously unattended design opportunities for tangible interactions with algorithms. Therefore, we explored how 15 users of a famous movie recommender system materialized tangible designs to reflect and discuss their algorithmic imaginaries during co-design workshops and interviews. Using thematic analysis, we identified two forms of algorithmic imaginaries that can inspire tangible interactions with recommender algorithms: metaphoric and datafied representations. Complementary themes exposed the influence of contextual factors and diverse negative attitudes towards personalized movie recommendations. Based on these findings, we suggest design opportunities and suggestions for improving the algorithmic experience of movie recommendations and similar systems through tangible user interfaces.",

      "abstract": "Given the material nature of data physicalization, their creators need to make many design decisions, including material choices and scale. Our study explores the impact of scale in physicalization, motivated by the assumption that size can affect user experience. We created two different physicalizations (for the same dataset) in three sizes each, and evaluated the resulting six objects with a questionnaire approach and interviews. Our findings highlight that scale needs to be chosen wisely given its impact on representation legibility (ease of viewing and understanding) and affordances for interaction. We discuss factors to take into account when designing large-scale physicalizations and in further research on the potential role of scale in physicalizaton. In particular, we argue that for large-scale physicalizations, scale should matter and communicate meaning, for instance, supporting an intuitive understanding of magnitudes, or a specific experience. Thus, scale needs to be an explicit design decision, that interacts with other design parameters. ",

      "abstract": "Empathy tools are experiences designed to evoke empathic responses by placing the user in another’s lived and felt experience. The problem is that designers do not have a common vocabulary to describe empathy tool experiences; consequently, it is difficult to compare/contrast empathy tools or to think about their efficacy. To address this problem, we analyzed 26 publications on empathy tools to develop a descriptive framework for designers of empathy tools. Based on our analysis, we found that empathy tools can be described along three dimensions: (i) the amount of agency the tool allows, (ii) the type of sensation that are experienced, and (iii) the user’s perspective while using the tool. We show that this framework can be used to describe a wide variety of empathy tools, and provide recommendations for empathy tool designers, as well as techniques for measuring the efficacy of an empathy tool experience.",

      "abstract": "We present Flowcuits, a DIY fabrication method to prototype tangible, interactive and functional electrical components by manipulating liquid metal mechanisms. The generated prototypes afford both physical and visual interactions to demonstrate the inner working, underlying concepts and mechanics of fundamental electronic elements and circuits, which we propose as a method to support playful learning. The fabrication process follows simple imprinting and sealing of fluidic circuits with a 3D printed stamp on a commonly accessible and inexpensive moldable substrate such as 'blu tack'. Utilizing gallium-indium (Ga-In) liquid metal as the conductive element, we demonstrated our approach can create interactive and customizable electronic components such as switches, variable resistors, variable capacitors, logic gates and pressure sensors. In this paper, we present the design analogy of Flowcuits, DIY fabrication approach including a parametric 3D stamp design toolkit and results from a technical evaluation of the demonstrators. The stamps are printed with a low-cost 3D printer and all the materials are inexpensive and reusable, enabling Flowcuits to be easily used without any advance lab facilities.",

      "abstract": "E-textiles, which embed circuitry into textile fabrics, blend art and creative expression with engineering, making it a popular choice for STEAM classrooms. Currently, e-textile development relies on tools intended for traditional embedded systems, which utilize printed circuit boards and insulated wires. These tools do not translate well to e-textiles, which utilize fabric and uninsulated conductive thread. This mismatch of tools and materials can lead to an overly complicated development process for novices. In particular, rapid prototyping tools for traditional embedded systems are poorly matched for e-textile prototyping. This paper presents the ThreadBoard, a tool that supports rapid prototyping of e-textile circuits. With rapid prototyping, students can test circuit designs and identify circuitry errors prior to their sewn project. We present the design process used to iteratively create the ThreadBoard’s layout, with the goal of improving its usability for e-textile creators.\r\n",

These workshops cover e-textile techniques that lend themselves to making alternative game controllers leading up to a concept-led game jam. We use research creation approaches to prioritize creative exploration within a community group for marginalized makers. The goal of the research is to explore and elucidate the overlap between e-textiles and experimental game making. We discuss our playful use of workshops as research method to iterate on the embodied experience of making on behalf of our participants. Our contribution maps the connections between workshop design and development, learning materials generated, through to application within an online game jam setting.",

      "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is often used invisibly in everyday applications with little opportunity for consumers to investigate how it works. In this paper, we expand recent efforts to unfold what students should know about ML and how to design tools and activities that allow them to engage with ML. To do so, we explore how to make processes and aspects of ML tangible through the design of the Machine Learning Machine (MLM); a tangible user interface which enables students to create their own data-sets using pen and paper and to iteratively build and test ML models using this data. Based on insights from the design process and a pilot study with the MLM, we discuss how a tangible approach to engaging with ML can spur curiosity in students and how the iterative process of improving ML models can encourage students to reflect on the relation between data, model and predictions.",

      "abstract": "Motion capture technology is widely used in movement-related  Human-Computer Interaction, especially in digital arts such as digital dance performance. This paper presents a knit stretch sensor-based dance leotard design to evaluate the locations where the sensors best capture the movement on the body. Two studies are undertaken : (1) interviews to determine user requirements of a dance movement sensing system; (2) evaluation of sensor placement on the body. Ten interviewees including dancers, choreographers, and technologists describe their requirements and expectations for a body movement sensing system. The centre of the body (the torso) is determined to be the area of primary interest for dancers and choreographers to sense movement, and technologists find the robustness of textile sensors the most challenging for textile sensing system design. A dance leotard toile is then designed with sensor groupings on the torso along the direction of major muscles, based on the interviewees' preferred movements to be captured. Each group of the sensors are evaluated by comparing their signal output and a Vicon motion capture system. The evaluation shows sensors which are constantly under tension perform better. For example, sensors on the upper back have a higher success rate than the sensors on the lower back. The dance leotard design was found to capture the movements of standing backbends and standing waist twists the best.",

      "abstract": "Citizen participation in urban planning has become more important in the past decades. In recent years, the practice of co-creation has become a popular tool to structure this participatory process. Co-creation is a process that actively involves stakeholders in cooperatively sharing and developing opinions and perspectives towards an outcome that contributes to the overall development. In particular in large and slow processes such as urban planning, co-creation risks becoming abstract and difficult to engage with for stakeholders. This study investigates an experiential approach to participation in urban planning. By building on embodiment to engage participants physically and expressively, this study aims to elicit an understanding between different points of view. With the design of the “What’s going Ön?” experience we explore how Virtual Reality (VR) can play a role in the participation of citizens in the urban planning process of the Ön island in Umeå, Sweden. We present the designed experience and the qualities that play a role in using VR as a tool for participation in Urban Planning.",

      "abstract": "Concrete is a ubiquitous material in urban environments and increasingly used by industry and the maker movement, also because of its material properties. However, there is little research about its affordance and its potential for embedded User Interfaces (UI). In our ongoing work, we investigate different manufacturing processes and design strategies to change and adapt the affordances of concrete to make it appear interactive. \r\nWe tested three interface elements, a button, a scroll wheel, and a slider, with 33 participants in a lab elicitation study. \r\nEach was created in two versions following two design strategies, one with a more natural look, the other more abstract.\r\nFive participants then bodystormed ideas with the prototypes in an outdoor environment. Based on our explorations, we derive 5 design recommendations for creating concrete interfaces, discuss the potential of both design strategies and present different application scenarios.",

      "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in interactive visuals in contemporary dance performances. These visuals often rely on embodied interaction techniques, such as motion capture or biosignal sensors. However, there is a lack of research into how audience members experience these interactive visuals, and how to enhance that experience. We conducted an audience study, involving four different dance performances. Each of the performances explored a different approach for interaction involving visuals. We collected data from audience members, regarding their experience of the performances, using questionnaires and interviews. The analysis of this data allows us to identify implications for design: balancing trade-offs within a mapping clarity spectrum; connecting layers; visuals as co-creative mediator; defined territory and individuality of visuals; exploration of perspective shift and abstract fragmentation. We argue that these considerations are relevant for designers of systems visualizing embodied interaction, not just for dance, but also for other related applications.",

Embroidered with e-textiles, we implement Soft Speakers as tactile, malleable and aesthetic designs to be part of wearables, soft furnishing and fabric objects. We present a rapid technique for the DIY fabrication of audio feedback into soft interfaces. We also discuss and evaluate 5 factors for their parametric design in additive and constructive methods. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and the breadth of new designs that it enables, we developed 5 prototypes: 3 wearables, a piece of furniture and a soft toy. Studying Soft Speakers with maker-users demonstrates expanding the design space, empowering users and supporting inclusive design for both adults and children. Insights from our study show interactive applications in soft interfaces for remote communication, e-learning, entertainment, navigation and gaming, enabled by Soft Speakers’ customizable and scalable form factor.",

The toolkit allows designers with no technical knowledge to leverage their material expertise to experiment with shape-change. We present the toolkit design, and case studies with two design studios who used the toolkit for 15-days each. Through the presentation of their process, we reflect on two main themes: empowering designers to participate in shape-change exploration; and the developing practice of designing objects which integrate motion. We situate this work as part of the growing efforts in the TEI community to involve designers in the evolution of shape-changing interfaces, and demonstrate how material-oriented designers could contribute to this field in which materiality plays a major role in.",

The self-tracker sends the data to an accompanying smartphone application to support patients in understanding their illness, be used in doctors’ consultation, and collect data for allergy research. We chose natural leather as a material for this domestic medical device due to its associations with everyday artifacts, so it would be easier to integrate it into allergy patients’ everyday lives.",

However, it is an emergent field and there is a dearth of design knowledge especially when it comes to designing wearables for mainstream gaming platforms such as game consoles. Our aim is to explore this field elaborately with a research through design approach and also clearly exemplify how our design process progressed through different phases. Our results, apart from helping wearables designers to understand critical features for mainstream gaming, will also demonstrate the techniques and methods for extracting knowledge from PD workshops and incorporating it in a conceptual design phase.

The TEI community with its traditional focus on the physical aspects of human-machine-interaction apparently didn’t yet succeed to offer a sustainable answer to the challenges of our time. We would like to invite all TEI2021 participants to share their professional and private experiences during the past year through entertaining or serious anecdotes. How did you cope with your forced online life? Did you develop any physical counter-strategies to escape the virtualization of your life, work and social environment? Please post your anecdotes in the #opening-panel channel on Discord, we will invite selected contributors to participate live during the opening panel.",
