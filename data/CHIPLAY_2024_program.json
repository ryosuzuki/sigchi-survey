      "abstract": "The games research community has developed substantial knowledge on designing engaging experiences that draw players in. Surprisingly, less is known about player disengagement, with existing work predominantly addressing disengagement from the perspective of problematic play, and research exploring player disengagement from a constructive designer perspective is lacking. In this paper, we address this gap and argue that disengagement from games should be constructively designed, allowing players to exit play sessions in a self-determined way. Following a two-phase research approach that combines an interview study (n=16) with a follow-up online survey (n=111), we systematically analyze player perspectives on exiting play sessions. Our work expands the existing notion of disengagement through a characterization of exit experiences, a lens on disengagement as a process, and points for reflection for the design of games that seek to address player disengagement in a constructive way.",

      "abstract": "The potential benefits of playing video games during times of difficulty have been increasingly recognised by researchers yet little is known about how particular aspects of games may relate to different forms of coping. An exploratory survey of 130 participants and content analysis identified 31 game aspects, across 6 categories, that were beneficial or detrimental to players. Our findings illustrate that games can support a range of coping strategies, including emotion-focused, avoidance, and meaning-focused coping. We also identify how specific aspects of games relate to different coping strategies during times of personal difficulty. For instance, emotion-focused coping was most commonly linked to challenge game aspects, where overcoming difficulties allowed players to experience positive emotions such as competence. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into how games may be able to facilitate a range of coping strategies during tough times.",

Although IS is extremely common (especially in high achievers, e.g., academics), few studies offer effective modes of support and recovery. In response, we introduce the application of relatable narrative as a way to help people overcome IS. We present a randomized group comparison study exploring the impact of various design factors -- specifically, choice-based interactivity and character relatability -- on our story's capacity to engage and impact 107 STEM undergraduates. Almost all participants enthusiastically endorsed the story as a valuable learning experience, and a majority reported positive impacts to mood and feelings of relatedness to peers. We discuss 1) how our specific digital story design can support positive changes in mental health at both individual and institutional levels and 2) how our findings can inform efficient design of interactive narrative content for educational applications.",

      "abstract": "Exergaming, blending exercise and gaming, improves the physical and mental health of older adults. We currently do not fully know the factors that drive older adults to either engage in or abstain from exergaming. Large-scale studies investigating this are still scarce, particularly those studying East Asian older adults. To address this, we interviewed 64 older adults from China, Japan, and South Korea about their attitudes toward exergames. Most participants viewed exergames with a positive inquisitiveness. However, socio-cultural factors can obstruct this curiosity. Our study shows that perceptions of aging, lifestyle, the presence of support networks, and the cultural relevance of game mechanics are the crucial factors influencing their exergame engagement. Thus, we stress the value of socio-cultural sensitivity in game design and urge the HCI community to adopt more diverse design practices. We provide several design suggestions for creating more culturally approachable exergames.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Metacognitive monitoring involves evaluating one's own thought processes and knowledge. In recent efforts to design serious games for educational purposes, scaffolds for the metacognitive monitoring process have been provided to help pupils achieve higher learning outcomes. In preliminary studies on the affects experienced in learning process, relationships between facial expressions and metacognitive monitoring performance (MMP) are revealed. As scaffolds are designed to avoid increasing cognitive load and disrupting the learning process, our research aims to automatically scaffold the metacognitive monitoring process through facial expressions without disturbing pupils’ learning process. We conducted a large-scale user study with pupils and collected their facial expressions while they performed the metacognitive monitoring process. So far, we built the video dataset (Affect2Metacognition) to train and test state-of-the-art neural networks for MMP identification. In addition, we proposed a strategy for scaffolding pupils' metacognitive monitoring process, which is based on identifying their MMPs through facial expressions. In the long term of our research, we will analyse the impact of this strategy on pupils' learning outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Player Experience (PX) in video games is a multifaceted construct encompassing affective, perceived, and subjective dimensions. While extensively explored in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and games user research studies, the practical evaluation of PX, especially concerning audio elements, remains challenging. This paper presents a Literature Review (LR) (n=26), which addresses the gap in the literature related to audio in PX evaluation, unveiling trends and issues. We used Creswell's methodology for LR, exploring three major research questions that investigate the approaches, instruments, and methodologies used to evaluate audio in digital games, the constructs of player experience related to audio assessment, and the challenges faced by researchers in this context. Our findings underscores challenges in the generalization of study outcomes, audio personalization and variation and audio-games evaluation. This work strives to bridge the gap between research and practice, fostering a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between audio and PX in games.",

      "abstract": "There are growing efforts to reduce the harmful effects of deceptive patterns pervasively employed on e-commerce websites. However, efforts to produce new guidelines and introduce ethical design standards geared towards older adults have been limited. We investigate the potential of a serious game in fostering older adults’ resilience against manipulative designs in e-commerce through two studies. First, a survey with older adults (N = 61), explored their attitudes towards deceptive patterns and identified characteristics influencing them. We then created a serious game, “Shopopolis”, to bolster older adults’ resistance to manipulative designs online and evaluated its efficacy with older adults (N = 65). Our findings show that Shopopolis is a valuable tool for enhancing awareness, concern, and recognition skills related to e-commerce deceptive patterns. We discuss older adults’ unique perspectives on deceptive patterns and consider how insights can shape the design of targeted protective measures like Shopopolis for older adults in e-commerce contexts.",

However, reliable automatic detection methods to generate such visualizations require costly, knowledge-intensive training data. To facilitate data collection for media bias datasets, we present News Ninja, a game employing data-collecting game mechanics to generate a crowdsourced dataset. Before annotating sentences, players are educated on media bias via a tutorial. Our findings show that datasets gathered with crowdsourced workers trained on News Ninja can reach significantly higher inter-annotator agreements than expert and crowdsourced datasets with similar data quality. As News Ninja encourages continuous play, it allows datasets to adapt to the reception and contextualization of news over time, presenting a promising strategy to reduce data collection expenses, educate players, and promote long-term bias mitigation.",

      "abstract": "Entertainment media, including video games, utilize background music (BGM) to enhance ambiance and gameplay, with a growing trend of players replacing in-game audio with personal music for potentially improved gameplay. Yet, research has not systematically investigated the connection between liked or disliked BGM and player behavior and experience. With our work, we make this step by letting users play the popular and well-researched game Tetris with BGM of their choice, and go one step further by adding music to the game that they specifically dislike, as this direction has been neglected thus far, but could prove interesting to target certain player behavior or experience. In our lab-study (N=31) we found that liked BGM increased engagement with the game and enhanced player experience, while disliked music reduced immersion. These findings suggest that music preferences should be taken into greater account in game design, e.g. by offering more options for BGM customization.",

      "abstract": "As Virtual Reality (VR) games become more popular, it is crucial to understand how deceptive game design patterns manifest and impact player experiences in this emerging medium. Our study sheds light on the presence and effects of manipulative design techniques in commercial VR games compared to a traditional computer game. We conducted an autoethnography study and developed a VR Deceptive Game Design Assessment Guide based on a critical literature review. Using our guide, we compared how deceptive patterns in a popular computer game are different from two commercial VR titles. While VR’s technological constraints, such as battery life and limited temporal manipulation, VR’s unique sensory immersion amplified the impact of emotional and sensory deception. Current VR games showed similar but evolved forms of deceptive design compared to the computer game. We forecast more sophisticated player manipulation as VR technology advances. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how deceptive game design persists and escalates in VR. We highlight the urgent need to develop ethical design guidelines for the rapidly advancing VR games industry.",

      "abstract": "Many videogames require players to perform under pressure; however, not all players respond equivalently to pressure: why are some players more likely to tilt (lose control during play) or choke (perform poorly relative to their ability) whereas others seem to thrive under pressure? Given the importance of both emotion regulation in tilting and optimal arousal in achieving optimal performance, we propose that individual differences in ability to down-regulate negative affect under stress--known as failure-related action-state orientation (fASO)--could explain propensity to choke under pressure. We conducted an online between-subjects experiment (N=144) in which we measured baseline performance in Super Hexagon (day 1), then exposed participants to a stress induction (i.e., PASAT-C) or had them play a low-intensity bubble-popping game before playing again (day 2). Under stress, players higher in fASO performed better relative to their baseline in terms of average time alive and stalled progress; whereas, without stress, players lower in fASO performed better on both measures. Traits reflective of proposed explanations for choking (i.e., reinvestment, attentional control) did not influence performance under pressure. The ability to down-regulate negative affect and overcome setbacks is a useful theoretical lens to explore why some players choke under pressure, whereas others thrive. ",

      "abstract": "Mobile games have become mainstream in the gaming market, generating revenue primarily through the Free-to-Play (F2P) model. The F2P business model influences game design and service methodologies, requiring new efforts to enhance player satisfaction through game services. The F2P business model has led to strategies aimed at early player conversion. To assess the effectiveness of early-stage conversion strategies, we analyzed data from an idle RPG game called “Dealers Only Squad”. We examined the relationship between the time taken from signing up to the game to making the first in-app purchase and retention, presenting findings on ‘Payer Retention’. Analysis has shown that a 1-day delay in the first in-app purchase improved average D+1 day retention by 0.29%-points and D+7 day retention by 1.35%-points. Based on these findings, the study suggests that in-app purchases made in the early stages can induce a negative gaming experience and increase churn rather than maintain retention, partially criticizing the effectiveness of early-stage conversion strategies.",

While water features such as fountains are often used architecturally to drive the feeling of a place, most such examples are passive, involving little participation from the guest. We present the Hydrone, a small, autonomous watercraft that can transform small water features into personal, playful, and interactive experiences. This paper describes our initial explorations in creating connection between a land-bound guest and a Hydrone in the water. Our research-through-design (RtD) process explored and expanded the palette of expressive capabilities for the Hydrone through a series of prototype designs. These include the use of water jets and locomotion to evoke emotion, as well as physical design and aesthetic considerations.",

      "abstract": "In response to growing global concerns surrounding sedentary lifestyles among adults, the imperative to motivate physical activity has driven the exploration of Virtual Reality (VR) exergames as a promising solution. Personality traits, particularly competitiveness, can play a pivotal role in influencing individuals' motivation to engage in either competitive or non-competitive versions of the same exergame. While existing studies have primarily focused on sports-related competitive orientations, they have overlooked the potential gain in information from gaming-related personality traits. This research addresses this gap by using a modified gaming-related competitiveness questionnaire and evaluating a VR cycling exergame featuring solo, self-competition and virtual opponent cycling conditions in a controlled user study with 38 participants. Empirical findings reveal a notable difference in self-rated competitiveness between the two domains of sports and gaming, and significant correlations between some gamer-types and motivation. These findings highlight the importance of these personality types during exergaming and their potential efficacy for personalisation to increase motivation.",

      "abstract": "Tilt, characterized by heightened frustration, is a prevalent issue in esports, significantly impacting team dynamics and player well-being. Traditional Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) solutions often focus on individual strategies, overlooking the team-based nature of esports. This study introduces “TILTED”, a tabletop game co-designed with youth esports players, aimed at fostering open communication and empathy to collectively manage tilt. Findings from four user testing sessions with collegiate esports teams reveal that team-based interventions like “TILTED” can enhance team cohesion and provide effective strategies for emotional regulation. The game facilitates understanding and empathy among teammates for managing emotions and maintaining a positive team atmosphere. Our research underscores the importance of resetting strategies and shared mental models in helping to mitigate tilt and offers design implications for future team-based interventions to enhance team dynamics and tilt management strategies as a team.",

In our work, we address this issue through in-depth interviews with twelve audio designers working in the games industry. Through thematic analysis and content analysis, we show that principles of juicy design also apply to audio and sound design, and that it is applied intentionally to improve player feedback and experience. On this basis, our work contributes a conceptual foundation for juicy audio in its key factors of emphasis/augmentation, cohesion/coherence, and synesthesia. We identify associated attributes and provide implications for the design of games that seek to leverage juicy audio as a means of improving player experience. ",

      "abstract": "Self-reflection, a process consisting of evaluation, attribution, and adaptation, is recognized as key to learning in esports games. To better facilitate self-reflection, many games and third-party tools feature retrospective visualizations that provide players with details about their performance. However, previous work suggested that existing visualizations, which typically aggregate data, do not present sufficient information to players. In this work, we explore the impact of process visualizations, which present gameplay as a sequence of actions, on self-reflection and performance in a League of Legends training exercise through a mixed-methods study. Our results found that players who reflected using a process visualization significantly improved their performance and demonstrated significant differences in how they evaluated themselves compared to those who reflected using an aggregate visualization. We discuss what these results mean in relation to self-reflection and learning in esports and how they impact the future use of process visualizations in games.",

      "abstract": "Media (e.g., film) are often designed around cisgender, heternormative logics and are not representative of the multiplicity of identities and identity expressions that exist in the world. Thus, media impedes the identity expression and performance of the communities who use them, as we do not see many parts of our identities represented or find that our identities are misrepresented. Video games, which are a genre of media, are especially problematic in how they perpetuate heteronormative normative logics. Unlike most media, however, video games give people agency over the aesthetics of game worlds--the characters and narratives--through the installation of mods. We conducted a content analysis coupled with a triangulation of mods through personal experience focused on the widely popular farming simulation game Stardew Valley. Drawing on a conceptual lens bringing together theories of identity and aesthetic agency, we highlight how the aesthetic agency afforded by mod installation provides opportunities for reclaiming representational diversity in game worlds along the following dimensions: sex and intimacy, gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity, and body diversity. We discuss the implications of mod installation, exploring its potential relationship with identity work and identity play. We then propose design guidelines for achieving aesthetic alignment.",

      "abstract": "Repeated measurements of player experience are crucial in games user research, assessing how different designs evolve over time. However, this necessitates lightweight measurement instruments that are fit for the purpose. In this study, we conduct an examination of the test-retest reliability of the miniPXI —a short variant of the Player Experience Inventory (PXI ), an established measure for measuring player experience. We analyzed test-retest reliability by leveraging four games involving 100 participants, comparing it with four established multi-item measures and single-item indicators such as the Net Promoter Score (NPS) and overall enjoyment. The findings show mixed outcomes; the miniPXI demonstrated varying levels of test-retest reliability. Some constructs showed good to moderate reliability, while others were less consistent. On the other hand, multi-item measures exhibited moderate to good test-retest reliability, demonstrating their effectiveness in measuring player experiences over time. Additionally, the employed single-item indicators (NPS and overall enjoyment) demonstrated good reliability. The results of our study highlight the complexity of player experience evaluations over time, utilizing single and multiple items per construct measures. We conclude that single-item measures may not be appropriate for long-term investigations of more complex PX dimensions and provide practical considerations for the applicability of such measures in repeated measurements.",

      "abstract": "Cybersecurity campaigns often fail because tools and practices, like password managers, appear too daunting or difficult to implement. While prior work has shown that transformational game design approaches to improving players’ security self-efficacy can show promise in encouraging more secure behaviors in players, we still lack a systematic understanding of how and why these features work, or how these approaches differ in their impact on players’ behavior change. This paper presents and describes the design and implementation of a transformational game called C.A.L.Y.P.S.O., incorporating 12 dynamically toggle-able design patterns inspired by Bandura’s principles for self-efficacy design in order to encourage users’ adoption of expert-recommended cybersecurity tools and best practices. These 12 design patterns consist of self-efficacy design features explored in other work, and other techniques of the authors’ own design. The goal of this work is to draw on psychological theories of self-efficacy to develop design patterns that can be translated to other contexts to enhance end-user cybersecurity behaviors and to build a game that will enable researchers to assess the effectiveness of these design patterns in comparison to one another.",

Our findings show that current design strategies dominantly reproduce many of the relatively passive characteristics of a traditional museum experience, signalling opportunities for design that leverages the affordances of VR to offer additional spatial, embodied, and playful experiences with paintings. \r\n",

This paper presents the design of a virtual reality (VR) experience that strategically employs engagement strategies such as anticipation, surprise, juiciness, and agency, aimed at enhancing learning within science education. Leveraging the immersive capabilities of VR, the virtual environment seeks to adapt these social media elements to examine their potential in boosting engagement and learning. The VR experience will be used in an experiment featuring a controlled design, varying levels of interaction and sensory feedback to evaluate their influence on participants' understanding of scientific concepts. By integrating these engaging elements, the experiment anticipates enhancing the educational utility of VR, guiding the development of more effective VR educational tools and broadening the appeal and accessibility of science learning for diverse audiences.",

The intersection of gaming and transportation has led to innovative ideas for in-car gaming, leveraging the unique context of vehicle environments. However,  a significant research gap remains in understanding user preferences, behaviors, and cross-cultural variations in in-car gaming experiences. This thesis aims to address this gap using a mixed methods approach to explore user needs and preferences, cultural influences, and design considerations for in-car gaming. Through a scoping review, surveys, interviews, and field studies, this thesis aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon and develop design guidelines for culturally relevant and engaging in-car gaming experiences to transform gaming in vehicles and develop in-car entertainment.",

      "abstract": "Extreme social isolation, known in Japan as hikikomori, is a growing concern in several countries worldwide. Video-games have been suggested to help bring hikikomori people back into social lifestyles, with past research alluding to potentially useful game genres for game-based interventions, such as Visual Novels and Location-Based Games. However, little research has actively implemented games with different features and tested their efficacy towards bringing hikikomori individuals outside. Therefore, this research aims to use a user-centered approach to develop different game interventions for high-risk hikikomori players. To quantify the effectiveness of the interventions, I will administer the UCLA Loneliness Scale to measure perceived loneliness and the NEET-Hikikomori Scale (NHR) to measure the risk of becoming hikikomori. The results of the experiments will culminate in the proposal of a framework for creating game-based interventions to help socially isolated people return to more social lifestyles.",

      "abstract": "This contribution describes the development of \"Virtual Real Space\" (VRS), or a form of mixed-reality space that translates players' home environments into virtual scenarios, enabling immersive and social gaming experiences. While conventional virtual reality games isolate players from their real surroundings, thus affecting their capacity for social interaction and immersion, VRSs superimpose the physical experiences of players with experiences into virtual spaces: the home becomes the base for in-game narration and virtual interaction. A series of prototypes helped to derive guidelines for the creation of VRSs, combining both real and virtual experiences into highly enveloping game scenarios. The findings of extensive gaming tests show remarkable results: first, that the familiar environment of the home provides a reliable frame for physical movement and interaction, and simultaneously, it becomes a virtually-enhanced environment that motivates players to a deeper, more intensive engagement and devotion to the game.",

      "abstract": "Quantum computing is an emerging technology with a burgeoning industry and growing workforce needs. The demand for computer scientists with quantum computing knowledge is increasing, as their skills are needed to make quantum computing a scalable and useful resource. However, few computer scientists are formally educated in quantum computing, with most education occurring in physics curricula. Although some open source learning resources and software tools for quantum computing are available, they employ a quantum mechanical, hardware-driven framing that poses accessibility challenges for computing-focused learners. Educational games have seen some success in quantum computing outreach initiatives, particularly in building intuition for quantum mechanical concepts, but rarely relate to computing practices. This submission outlines a doctoral research programme that seeks to develop computing-centred interactions with quantum computing systems, and to explore how play can be leveraged in these interactions as a means of building quantum intuitions in a computing context.",

      "abstract": "Playing partial information, restricted communication, cooperative (PIRCC) games with humans have proven challenging for AI, due to our reliance on social dynamics and sophisticated cognitive techniques. Yet, recent advances in generative AI may change this situation through new forms of human-AI collaboration. This paper investigates how teams of players interact with an AI assistant in the PIRCC game Codenames and the impact this has on cognition, social dynamics, and player experience. We observed gameplay and conducted post-game focus groups with 54 participants across ten groups. Each group played three rounds of Codenames, with an AI assistant supporting Cluegivers. We found the AI assistant enhanced players’ convergent and divergent thinking, but interfered with formation of team mental models, highlighting a tension in the use of AI in creative team scenarios. The presence of the AI challenged many players' understanding of the “spirit of the game”. Furthermore, the presence of the AI assistants weakened social connections between human teammates, but strengthened connections across teams. This paper provides an empirical account of an AI assistant's effect on cognition, social dynamics, and player experience in Codenames. We highlight the opportunities and challenges that arise when designing hybrid digital boardgames that include AI assistants.",

      "abstract": "The project aims to explore the game mechanics to design a competitive AR board game that enables interaction between players. We explore existing best practices of AR design, and apply them in the development of Themojelly, a local multiplayer board game in AR for smartphones that integrates virtual elements with tangible interfaces. In Thermojelly, each player controls with a joystick shown on his/her smartphone a virtual avatar, with the shape of a jelly, and can play with two different party mini-games, both with the play goal to run and jump across the path designed using the physical board. The board is composed of 8 squared tiles and the players will personalize the map by placing the tiles on a desk, each tile represents an obstacle or an help for the avatar to race to the goal. The players can place the tiles both horizontally or at different heights (for example putting a tile on a pile of books), exploring different physical interaction modalities. The coordinates of all the virtual objects are computed with respect to a shared physical space: for a fluid AR multiplayer each player with the smartphone will have a different point of view of the same real and virtual worlds. Through this approach different players share the same play space, and visualize in contemporary all the events happening in the game from different points of view. To assess usability and players’ AR experience we performed a study with 22 participants. Each participant installed in his/her smartphone the Thermojelly and played at the boardgame at home involving parents and friends (we required each participant to play with at least 1 other player), after the play they filled out a questionnaire on the AR experience. Results showed that the play with the AR board was perceived as fluid and fun, and players appreciated in particular the possibility to personalize and build the play map, however the joystick control of the virtual avatar during the race was perceived as unnecessary complex to use, indicating that is required a easier interaction modality that should not require to touch the screen while the user is framing the board.",

It will consist of three qualitative case studies in Danish game studios and education through which I apply ethnographic participation to develop grounded and context-dependent results. Overall, I undertake research across game design praxeology, organizational science, and sociology of work to analyse the working and learning environment of game makers in its socio-economic context: How are interdisciplinary work forms and competences cultivated among newcomers for working in the Danish game industry? The primary objective, then, is to examine how newcomers to the Danish game industry are trained for interdisciplinary work and contextualize such expertise from within studio workplaces and Danish society. Like any case study, my project will provide rich contextual descriptions of challenges that newcomers face, and inform debates on game education curriculum and policy in Denmark.",

      "abstract": "The opioid epidemic is a persistent public health problem throughout Canada, with opioid-related deaths spiking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Focusing on Brantford and Hamilton, Ontario, which have high rates of opioid poisoning, this participatory game jam project examines how 21 adults (ages 18+) with a history of opioid addiction make sense of their life experiences through the processes of autobiographical game-based storytelling, including ideation, narrative design, and environmental storytelling. Phenomenological interviews, processual artifacts like concept sketches, doodles, and reflections, and game prototypes generated through Scratch, Twine, and Bitsy facilitated the exploration of six key phenomena representing autobiographical game-based storytelling: maze metaphors, decision-making, compact games, morality and religion, resilience, and social communion. This interdisciplinary project explores how game-based storytelling supports recovery and restores dignity among adults experiencing opioid addiction while raising awareness of health inequities, thereby humanizing the opioid crisis.",

      "abstract": "Over the last decade, the free-to-play (F2P) game business model has gained popularity in the games industry. We examine the role of deceptive design during a game’s transition to F2P and its impacts on players. Our analysis focuses on game mechanics and a Reddit analysis of the Overwatch (OW) series after it transitioned to an F2P model. Our study identifies nine game mechanics that use deceptive design patterns. We also identify factors contributing to a negative gameplay experience. Business model transitions in games present possibilities for problematic practices. Our findings identify the need for game developers and publishers to balance player investments and fairness of rewards. A game’s successful transition depends on maintaining fundamental components of player motivation and ensuring transparent communication. Compared to existing taxonomies in other media, games need a comprehensive classification of deceptive design. We emphasize the importance of understanding player perceptions and the impact of deceptive practices in future research.",

      "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) has been largely deployed on smartphones in recent years. AR gaming, featured with geo-reference, is anchored to our real-world environments. Nevertheless, designing such AR user interaction in-the-wild is under-explored. Therefore, we examined 242 YouTube videos regarding AR gameplay, primarily Pokémon GO, (1) to reveal personal and social threats during gameplay, and (2) to identify how such threats connect to the user and spatial contexts. Our video analysis generalises the threats, including but not limited to hitting bystanders, falling off a cliff, car crashes, crowds and blockages, and stampedes. Through video analysis, we connect the threats with the user and spatial contexts. Subsequently, we propose several design tactics to deliver safe and nuisance-free AR usages in physical environments. Finally, we suggest strategies to consider large-scale deployment of AR at the levels of individuals and local communities, such as an auditable and accountable framework for user safety and social acceptability.",

      "abstract": "Character design in games involves interdisciplinary collaborations, typically between designers who create the narrative content, and illustrators who realize the design vision. However, traditional workflows face challenges in communication due to the differing backgrounds of illustrators and designers, the latter with limited artistic abilities. To overcome these challenges, we created Sketchar, a Generative AI (GenAI) tool that allows designers to prototype game characters and generate images based on conceptual input, providing visual outcomes that can give immediate feedback and enhance communication with illustrators' next step in the design cycle. We conducted a mixed-method study to evaluate the interaction between game designers and Sketchar. We showed that the reference images generated in co-creating with Sketchar fostered refinement of design details and can be incorporated into real-world workflows. Moreover, designers without artistic backgrounds found the Sketchar workflow to be more expressive and worthwhile. This research demonstrates the potential of GenAI in enhancing interdisciplinary collaboration in the game industry, enabling designers to interact beyond their own limited expertise.",

As collaborative encounters built on community, game jams create unique interpersonal possibilities. Tapping into this relational potential, we integrated elements of humanistic psychology and the person-centred approach into a game jam: We engaged 19 participants in the making of games for self-care and mental health, over the course of a week, as a remote event hosted by the National Videogame Museum, UK. We go on to thematically analyse our shared discussions to unpack the jam as a mutual sense-making activity between facilitators and participants, demonstrating how the jam functioned as a space in which the status quo of mental health could be negotiated; contributing to the jam's sense of community, and generation of caring, novel designs. Finally, we outline two design opportunities for game designers, developers and researchers that seek to engage with the experiential nature of game jams care-fully.",

      "abstract": "Attempts to digitize pinball have been met with skepticism; however, VR presents a new opportunity to access and enjoy this popular game. In a controlled study (N=60), we investigated how physical pinball, VR pinball, and PC pinball differ in terms of player experience (pX) and task demand using both quantitative and qualitative data. Participants mainly preferred physical pinball, followed by VR pinball; only two participants preferred pinball on the PC. With the exception of immersion, results showed no pX differences between physical and VR pinball; although PC pinball was rated as inferior on multiple dimensions. Furthermore, enjoyment of physical pinball was associated with curiosity, control, and challenge, whereas in VR and PC pinball, immersion and audiovisual appeal mattered. Interestingly, preference and pX did not depend on existing familiarity with pinball. Our findings suggest that VR can offer an accessible, enjoyable pinball experience, regardless of familiarity.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, the rise of telehealth and virtual medicine, and the increased accessibility of commercial VR headsets have created opportunities to revitalize the physical therapy field and introduce more innovative tools to complement traditional practice. Researchers are actively exploring the intersection of VR, exergames, and gamified exercise to create new products that can improve both provider efficiency and patient care. This study builds on that momentum by delving into the perspectives of practitioners. We interviewed eight physical therapists after letting them experience a state-of-the-art VR exercise product (i.e., Supernatural VR). Participants loved the game and were most optimistic about the mental benefits of using VR exergames alongside traditional PT, but cautioned the lack of feedback and expert guidance that could lead to misuse and further injury. Regarding the future integration of VR and PT, participants were cautiously optimistic and offered design feedback and recommendations, with warnings regarding the potential barriers to innovating clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "How can blind and sighted individuals play together? The natural disparity in visual abilities often poses challenges for fair competition in social play. This can diminish the confidence of visually impaired (VI) individuals and reduce engagement for sighted players. While previous literature has incorporated fairness design strategies for the VI, we additionally aim to address the potential problem of boredom for sighted players by providing enhanced visual feedback without compromising fairness as a novel design strategy. We present \"Hearing the Bullseye\", an archery exergame designed for harmonious play between VI individuals and their sighted family and friends. Players use a bow equipped with an infrared sensor, allowing them to target an unseen bullseye using sound rather than sight. An empirical study involving 18 sighted and VI participants demonstrated that the design strategies used in  \"Hearing the Bullseye\" effectively promote social engagement among both groups while ensuring fair competition.",

SoundTrek also employs sound design strategies, such as spatialized soundtracks and near-field audio to aid spatial navigation in the absence of visual cues and to create unique aesthetic experiences through sound. We present new ways of utilizing sound in virtual reality game design that highlights design considerations for audio-focused gameplay and diversifies the opportunities for creating rich, interactive soundscapes.",

There is increasing interest in novel ways to decrease toxicity and allow players to prevent exposure to toxicity. In this work-in-progress, we present the concept of personalized matchmaking restrictions in online games, allowing players to customize with whom they are matched. We developed interactive mockups, conducted a study where participants (n = 11) could explore the prototypes followed by interviews, and conducted a preliminary analysis. We found that participants were quite positive about the system, with most highlighting that they would be willing to use it. However, they also noted potential concerns like effects on matchmaking and the risk of segmenting the player base. Our findings will be useful for creating future personalized matchmaking restrictions systems,\r\nwhich can help prevent exposure to toxicity and thus combat harm.",

      "abstract": "Action and concern about climate change keep increasing. Yet, the climate crisis has traditionally been perceived as far-away and abstract. It has been argued that forms of psychological distance such as geographic (it will not affect my local area) and social (it will not affect people like me) can lead to disengagement. Thus, interventions aiming to bring climate change closer are some of the most favored by experts. Among these, games and immersive technologies simulating distant and near locations have been proposed as ways to evoke emotional reactions and reduce psychological distance. Yet, our current knowledge can be strengthened and extended in several ways---existing interventions on media effects provide diverse results, controlled game-based interventions are rare, the use of real-world locations is also atypical, and the effects of combining a distance-centered and a well-being frame are underexplored. Here, we conducted a two-by-two factorial experiment (digital game vs. text, and distant vs. near frame) involving a final sample size of 126. The findings indicate that these media and frames similarly reduced psychological distance and increased issue involvement. Experienced immersion was also similar in all conditions. Based on our observations, we propose methodological and design ideas for future research.",

      "abstract": "Immersive virtual reality (VR) exergames blend playful environments with physical activities. In such games, providing continuous cues, i.e., real-time indications of how the movements are being performed, can guide players and improve the execution of movements. However, research about how continuous cues impact player performance and experience in VR exergames remains sparse. To this end, we conducted a within-participants study (N=32) with four conditions: (i) no, (ii) audio, (iii) visual, and (iv) audiovisual cueing. The results show that both unimodal and bimodal cueing improve the player experience without causing cybersickness, while bimodal cueing improves pose accuracy. We provide three main design implications for VR exergames: (i) considering the granularity of cues, (ii) exploring different continuous cue designs, and (iii) underlining the use of continuous cues in other immersive experiences.",

      "abstract": "Although the significance of Mental Health (MH) is becoming increasingly more accepted worldwide, the level of MH Literacy (MHL) remains low. Individuals often find it uncomfortable to discuss this crucial topic. Unwillingness to discuss MH can be a result of the stigma surrounding the topic which results in misconceptions, discrimination, and reluctance to seek help or talk openly about MH challenges.\r\nEducating individuals about MH and encouraging open discussions are key to reducing stigma. \r\nGames have proven their effectiveness for diverse learning purposes. Our goal in this paper is to assess the potential of games and digital displays for MHL education and stigma reduction by incorporating MH educational content into a mobile game with different learning strategies and a large public display to create a community. We compare the pre and post-MHL of users before and after playing our game and the results show an improvement in the MHL of participants. Our paper contributes to game design approaches by identifying mechanisms for educating individuals about MH and our results indicate that the game helps reduce stigma through the use of large displays.",

      "abstract": "Underneath their compelling audiovisual surface, games require players to carry out mundane interaction work, such as pointing, typing, or steering. However, many of these underlying building blocks are not defined rigorously, hampering synthesis and analysis. We elaborate on the origin of tasks within human-computer interaction (HCI) and define tasks’ relationship to game terminology (game mechanics, goals, and actions). Our proposed framework draws on systemic-structural theory of activity to aid systematic analysis and exploration of game design by mapping gameplay to abstract core tasks. The framework contains four task tools, applicable when 1) uncovering design properties, 2) designing experimental manipulation, 3) creating behavioral measurements, and 4) describing gameplay in literature reviews of game genres and design techniques. We evaluated our framework as a lens to design purposeful games in three case studies within a scientific education. We invite researchers and practitioners to employ the framework as a microscope, to describe and design games rigorously.",

      "abstract": "Hand-eye coordination refers to the harmonization between visual information and hand movements. In this coordination, the information perceived by the eyes is used to guide the movements of the hands. In many games, hand-eye coordination is important for the player's experience. However, when players are faced with an unfamiliar activity, it can be a challenge to develop hand-eye coordination in a short period. This study proposes a method for hand-eye coordination training in gaming using Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS). By employing EMS, it is possible to enhance attention distribution during bilateral hand movements and improve hand-eye coordination, potentially enabling individuals to train hand coordination skills in a shorter period. To test the feasibility and effectiveness of our method, we first tested participants for attentional switching while wearing the EMS device to ensure that it did not negatively affect participants. Sixteen participants were then trained in hand-eye coordination with and without EMS, and the effects of the training were tested in a customized game and a real music game. The results showed that participants trained with EMS showed more significant improvements in scores and accuracy than those without EMS in both the custom game and the real game. We also conducted a retained effect experiment, which confirmed that participants retained the training effect one week after training. Thus, our study shows the possibility of using EMS as a new medium for training hand-eye coordination in games.",

This bears not only physical and mental health risks, but has already shown to be detrimental for skill acquisition, defeating its purpose in the first place. For the sake of health promotion, well-being, and the advancement of self-regulated learning, we specifically investigate the impact of detailed feedback on player performance. As research about comparable activities in related domains suggest inconclusive implications for when feedback in video game learning should be presented, we particularly explore the impact of delivering immediate versus delayed feedback, during or after play. Using (n=30) participants and the well-investigated Super Mario Bros., we communicate insights in favor for deploying feedback immediately when polishing one’s video game related skills such as in speedrunning.",

      "abstract": "Horror video games have often been criticized for their negative and unrealistic depiction of mental health, primarily through their\r\nportrayal of characters with mental illnesses. Such representations can perpetuate stigma and misconceptions about mental health\r\nissues. However, there has recently been a growing interest in accurate portrayals of these characters and how playing these video\r\ngames could also elicit empathy and mental health awareness. In our study, we explored how a psychological horror game such as\r\nSilent Hill 2 could foster empathy and mental health awareness through individual interviews with 11 participants. Our findings\r\nrevealed that participants gained a deeper understanding of mental health issues and empathy towards characters struggling with\r\nmental illnesses by interacting and controlling them. Participants had a greater attachment to the characters’ inner struggles and their\r\ngameplay was experienced as cathartic. Moreover, our findings highlighted the potential of psychological horror to serve as a platform\r\nfor character-driven narratives, showcasing how engagement with such games elicited empathy among participants. We contribute to\r\nan exploratory understanding that can assist game designers and writers in crafting narratives within the Psychological Horror genre\r\nthat foster empathy and mental health awareness.",

      "abstract": "In response to the unique challenges of Mixed Reality (MR) game development, we developed GAMR, an analytics tool specifically designed for MR games. GAMR aims to assist developers in identifying and resolving gameplay issues effectively. It features reconstructed gameplay sessions, heatmaps for data visualization, a comprehensive annotation system, and advanced tracking for hands, camera, input, and audio, providing in-depth insights for nuanced game analysis.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate GAMR's effectiveness, we conducted an experimental study with game development students across two game genres: action-adventure and first-person shooter (FPS). The participants used GAMR and provided feedback on its utility. The results showed a significant positive impact of GAMR in both genres, particularly in action-adventure games. This study demonstrates GAMR's effectiveness in MR game development and suggests its potential to influence future MR game analytics, addressing the specific needs of developers in this evolving area.",

HCI games research has been actively working on and promoting best practices in GUR. However, these practices often require resources, knowledge and expertise, which are not readily available for indie video games developers. Thus, to better understand how GUR can support these developers, we conducted an interview study with 13 indie games professionals to learn about their practices and the challenges they face when doing playtesting. We report on the key findings from this study, including challenges with finding appropriate participants and handling the data from playtests. We provide a discussion of how existing GUR practices can be adapted and what HCI games research can do to help mitigate these challenges to make playtesting more accessible and impactful to indie video games developers.",

      "abstract": "An esker is a geological formation created by a melting glacier, as subglacial streams of meltwater continuously add layers of gravel. A 3D printer crafts by adding layers of molten streams of plastic, in a continuous additive fabrication process. We designed the game ‘Playing Esker’, a strategy game where two players compete over the gradual printing of esker formations. Following a research-through-game-design approach, we document how additive material fabrication processes can be used as gamespaces, highlighting 3 themes for Additive Games: (1) Additive turn-taking, where we explored playful turn-based interactions with the printer. (2) Material constraints, where we treated material limitations as game mechanics. (3) Earth-procedurality, where we used procedural generation in combination with additive games to engage players with the unpredictable formations of the esker. Lastly, we reflect on geophilosophical and geological ideas, which we used as generative lenses to inspire new and alternative forms of world-building. By emphasising the earth and world-formation processes through gameplay, geophilosophy can inspire new modes of non-human world-building, agency and territoriality in games.",

      "abstract": "Therapy involving paper folding-based fine motor activities has proven effective for children with autism. However, the lack of professional special education training makes it challenging for parents to create suitable guided activities that motivate their children during home sessions. To address this, we introduce \\textit{Foldiverse}, an AR game-based solution. Providing paper folding tutorials and real-time interactive feedback, it transforms paper folding into an interactive virtual life. The gamification approach stimulates children's interest and enables parents to easily accompany the training at home. User experiments have shown that \\textit{Foldiverse} significantly increases children's engagement and anticipation, providing a more gamified and family-inclusive training method for autism rehabilitation.",

      "abstract": "Athletes often learn suboptimal techniques that place a ceiling on their performance or put them at risk of injury. Adopting a new technique can lead to a short-term dip in performance while learning it, which can be demotivating and cause an athlete to revert to their previous, suboptimal technique. To address the challenge of demotivation in adopting new techniques, we explore technique-oriented sport training games, which aim to improve sport skills by capturing behaviour and providing feedback that motivates adopting a new technique. As of yet, previous work has provided little information on how to design sports training games, and some early research suggests that immersive games may distract players, preventing them from being able to learn a new technique effectively. We designed a study comparing a baseline non-game training system with three versions of a running game, ranging from a simplistic text-based game to a 3D audiovisual game with motion feedback. We find that the games with more immersive elements were as effective as the baseline system for adopting a new technique but were preferred by players and improved their intrinsic motivation. We propose design considerations from these findings and provide new directions for researching effective sport training games.",

      "abstract": "Surfing is a popular recreational activity that benefits from technological innovation, such as the precision manufacturing of surfboards and apps for coaching. These advances have mostly focused on improving athletic performance, while the experiential aspects of surfing remain underexplored in terms of the design mediating interactive technology. We explore how playful interactive technology design can enrich the surfing experience. We adopted a soma design approach, considering the simultaneous influence of technology, body, and environment on surfing practice. Our process resulted in two design concepts: a smart wearable top and a soft robot, both aiming to connect the surfer to ocean information through haptic stimuli. By analysing and reflecting on our soma design process, we provide design insights advancing the knowledge for future design of interactive technology to enrich the surfing experience in a playful way. Our research contributes to aquatic interactive design knowledge, inspiring WaterHCI researchers and industry stakeholders to leverage interactive technology to enrich the water activity experiences of the world’s most iconic coastal water sport.",

      "abstract": "In open-world games, focusing on triggering the spatial exploration of the environment is crucial for engaging player experiences. Triggering players' spatial exploration can be achieved by evoking curiosity, a fundamental driving force behind game explorations. In this paper, we present the results of our pilot study in which we investigated the impact of secondary tasks, specifically coin collection, on player behavior and satisfaction within an open-world game. We used a procedural content generation algorithm to synthesize game levels with low and high spatial exploration targets. Later, we conducted a 2 (Spatial Exploration: low vs. high) × 2 (Coins: with vs. without) between-group study (N = 28) to validate how a secondary task (coin collection) could impact spatial exploration. Our findings reveal that the coins diminish players' spatial exploration, as spatial exploration scores and visited occupied cells decreased. Surprisingly, players expressed higher personal gratification when engaged with levels designed with low spatial exploration targets compared to those with higher spatial exploration targets, challenging our initial assumptions. We plan to conduct a large-scale study to validate these initial observations and explore additional metrics influencing gameplay engagement.",

      "abstract": "Digital games are part of millions of players’ daily lives. As such a popular pastime, they have the potential to directly affect players in a variety of positive and negative ways. Players experience benefits (e.g., social, emotional, and cognitive) by playing commercial video games, while there is also an increasing concern about harms associated with play, including toxic behaviour and hate, problematic gaming and addiction, challenges for access and equitable experiences, additional risks for vulnerable players (e.g., children), and deceptive design practices. \r\nWhile extensive research has explored how to better understand and define both benefits and harms associated with gameplay, we still have limited knowledge regarding practical and actionable approaches, strategies, and solutions to help players, designers and developers, and games researchers effectively promote game features maintaining these benefits and addressing potential harms of gameplay. Therefore, this workshop especially focuses on building creative strategies and solutions to enhance previously identified benefits while simultaneously mitigating the harms of gameplay. We will engage in activities to envision speculative futures where we have mitigated harms while maintaining the benefits of play. In doing so, we want to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in practical ways to achieve this goal through design strategies that are informed by a holistic perspective on the impact of games on players. We also hope to build community, exchange knowledge, and develop novel and practical solutions to foster healthier and safer gaming experiences and behavioural patterns. ",

      "abstract": "There are games designed to teach binary to decimal number conversion; however, this is typically done through single-player games or multiplayer games that focus on solving puzzles faster or playing against the systems. However, these games do not focus on creating conflict to generate challenges, which in turn aid in achieving the flow state. Thus, we designed ‘Error 409’, a multiplayer endogenous game, by introducing challenges through conflict. Our design goal was to mix physical and digital environments to create a portable game that can be played anywhere. ‘Error 409’ requires players to achieve their secret number(s) given by the Console to each player by switching bits (on/off) using a common switch panel available for both players. ‘Error 409’ will improve students’ knowledge and understanding of conversions from binary to decimal. This portable game may act as a catalyst to spark children's interest in fundamental computer science concepts through meaningful physical interactions.",

      "abstract": "Waiting is an everyday activity that is often present in video games. Waiting situations in games can happen during, for instance, loading screens, turn-based action in multiplayer games, and cut-scenes. Different waiting situations can cause both positive emotions, such as anticipation, and negative emotions, such as frustration. Thus, understanding how waiting relates to players’ emotions can be beneficial when designing player experiences. However, academic discussion on waiting in games is quite scattered, and there is no comprehensive overview available on the subject. In this work-in-progress paper, we contribute a literature review on the topic of waiting in video games. Based on the results, five categories of academic discussion are identified. These are (1) models of time in video games, (2) games with waiting as a core game mechanic, (3) mathematical analysis of game situations, (4) games as a research tool, and (5) other perspectives. We also identify many waiting situations that are not discussed in the existing literature; hence, we hope that our work stimulates and informs future work on this underexplored but important topic.",

The game explores themes of family obligations, filial piety, and the sacrifices made for love within the context of traditional Chinese culture. Utilizing computer vision and original audiovisual media, 'NEXT!' guides players through an emotional journey based on real-life experiences. This paper details the game's concept, interactive and technological innovations, and research findings. Through user testing and iterative design, we examine the alignment between the impact of the game mechanics on the perceived user experience and the designed narrative arc, transitioning from anxiety and duty to fun and emotional confrontation. The game effectively combines various design elements while addressing important cultural themes.",

      "abstract": "The last two years of 2023 and 2024 has seen massive layoffs in the video game industry. Many games studios laid off a considerable percentage of their work force or closed all together. While the reasons and effects of these layoffs have been extensively discussed, the impact of these layoffs on the CHI PLAY community and the wider field of HCI Games Research has not. Yet, we are deeply intertwined with the game industry, relying on it for the games, players, and communities we study, for the jobs the industry offers our students, and ultimately our funding opportunities. To discuss how these recent layoffs impact our community, if and how we should address these layoffs in our research and teaching and what we as researchers can do to help, we propose to host a panel at CHI PLAY 2024 featuring HCI games researchers, teachers, and industry observers.",

      "abstract": "This paper seeks to understand the connections between two previously disjoint subfields of game research and design: 1) the study of emotionally impactful games and 2) the study of game feel. Regarding games and emotion, we now understand aspects such as how negative emotions are appreciated in games and can be a desirable quality for designers and players alike. We also understand aspects of game feel such as the importance of responsive player character control and juicy (i.e. exaggerated) feedback for player actions. However, the literature on game feel rarely links to emotion research and focuses on a narrow subset of emotions/feelings such as power and control. Research is lacking on how game feel design can impact a wider palette of emotions, including negative ones, and how this may require one to \"break the rules\" of good game feel design, e.g., making it purposefully hard to control the player character. In this work-in-progress paper, we begin a systematic mapping of such connections between game feel and emotion. We conduct a Constructivist Grounded Theory analysis on the game feel of 42 mechanics from a diverse selection of games such as Journey, Celeste, and Freedom Bridge. We identify two core concepts, Deviation and Motif, along with 8 design concepts, as central to crafting emotionally impactful game feel.",

      "abstract": "Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) are important in games, as they can provide guidance to the player, create social engagement, and advance the game's narrative. Although much research exists regarding NPC interactions for traditional gaming environments, e.g. desktop or console, fewer works have considered this from a virtual reality (VR) perspective. Our work first uncovers the salient and unique dimensions of VR NPC interactions through observations of 47 existing games. We find that VR NPC interactions have an extended set of interaction mechanisms due to two key factors --- interaction triggers and player constraints within the game; driven by the unique qualities of physical motion and immersion afforded by the medium. We augment these findings through a user study performed on 18 participants in a VR environment. Participant interactions with a responsive NPC allow us to delve deeper into understanding player perception and expectations of NPC behaviour and interactions. Our findings outline player expectations for NPC realism, player agency during NPC interaction, and NPC expected behaviour and feedback. We tie our findings into discussions on player agency within VR, highlighting design suggestions to develop NPCs to better fit within social behaviour expectations. ",

      "abstract": "The importance of coping with stress for adolescents is well documented. Various approaches to providing stress-coping strategies have been proposed, and mindfulness has been one of the commonly introduced techniques. It has shown clinical evidence of effectiveness, and questionnaires measuring its efficiency have been developed as well. However, the majority of current methods take a conventional approach of involving verbal or text-based explanations of mindfulness practices, which suffer from a distinct lack of engagement and long-term adherence. However, there are still limited methods for introducing mindfulness to adolescents. In order to make mindfulness not only more accessible for teens but also more engaging and effective, we introduce Fido’s Therapy, an interactive narrative empathy game that involves players in three different mindfulness techniques, making the learning process more enjoyable and relatable to their daily experiences. In Fido’s Therapy, players follow the story of a teenage student who faces common stress factors of adolescence. The game is designed to keep players engaged and present mindfulness techniques as game mechanics that naturally allow players to practice mindfulness.",

      "abstract": "VR exergaming is a promising motivational tool to incentivise exercise. We present a novel VR exergaming method called social interactive feedforward. The player competes with an ‘enhanced model’ of one of their friends in a real-time VR environment, showing improved performance levels in a way the player can relate to. Social interactive feedforward was tested in a cycling-based VR exergame and players competed with enhanced models of themselves, their friend, and a stranger moving at the same enhanced pace. Results show that friend-modelled social interactive feedforward improves performance and intrinsic motivation the most. This indicates that the mere association of the enhanced model with their friend results in a rapid improvement\r\n in performance and motivation which implies that social feedforward was successfully elicited by using an enhanced friend’s model. This widens the application of self-modelled feedforward to a wide range of social options which enables players to also reap the benefits of socialising in addition to feedforward benefits.",

      "abstract": "Research on live streaming systems that incorporate real-time data, such as game or viewer data, have been a topic of HCI research for some time. Despite the potential of data-driven game streaming interfaces, translating this research into practice faces two key challenges. First, the design space afforded by data-driven game streaming systems is not yet well understood, making it difficult to identify how designs might meet users’ existing and potential needs. Second, adoption of these systems relies on engagement with the entire streaming ecosystem, which includes developers, streamers, moderators, and viewers, rather than with just one group. Through a two-phase design study, we investigate the expectations, desires, and experiences of streaming stakeholders, shedding light on how data-driven game streaming systems can meet their needs. Building upon these insights and drawing upon previous research, we propose a design framework aimed at analyzing and generating data-driven game streaming designs, thereby moving toward formalizing the design and development of such systems.",

      "abstract": "We propose EcoMeal, a gamified mobile application that helps users to understand the environmental impact of their daily food consumption. With EcoMeal, users scan the barcodes on packaging of food-related products to reveal details of factors influencing a product's ecological footprint. Moreover, our application determines the Eco-score of each product and provides users with a comprehensive breakdown to facilitate learning. EcoMeal incentivizes usage and engagement by incorporating a virtual garden where users grow vegetables using water drops. These are obtained by scanning products or by completing quizzes about product details. In a week-long between-subjects user study (N=14), we compared the gamified version of EcoMeal to a baseline version without gamification. We found that regardless of gamification, users perceived the app positively and acquired a deeper understanding of food-related ecological impact. In addition, our results show EcoMeal encouraged long-term usage and gamification increased user engagement.",

      "abstract": "Research on digital games has focused on engagement, often treating disengagement as a consequence of flawed game design and\r\ntherefore undesirable. We want to explore disengagement in a different light, as we believe it can lead to an overall more positive\r\nplayer experience through closure and satisfaction. The end of a game session can often lead to conflict between children and their\r\nparents/guardians, which we believe can be reduced by proper disengagement built directly into the game design. Disengagement\r\nfrom digital games has not been explored with children in previous research, leaving a gap that we want to fill. Our demo Snarky’s\r\nAdventure tries to explore this by centering key design decisions around ending the game session after a selected amount of playtime\r\nand easing the player out. This can be used to explore different effects on the player experience that result from in-game communication\r\nof remaining play time and additional closure features.",

      "abstract": "Envisioning a future with prevalent use of Mixed Reality (MR) Head-mounted Displays (HMD), introducing MR headsets into public and social spaces creates complex social challenges. The first challenge is the inherent power imbalance between collocated HMD wearers and non-wearers, where non-wearers cannot see what HMD wearers see. The second challenge is the inherent asymmetry of MR experiences between collocated HMD wearers, where each HMD wearer can only see their MR digital objects privately, perceiving their own version of reality. How can we leverage the imbalances and asymmetry of the MR medium into game elements for a unique gaming experience? This demonstration introduces \"MOFA The Ghost,\" an asymmetric inter-bodily mixed reality social exertion game inspired by the cinematic classic, Ghostbusters. Based on spontaneous collocated mixed reality technology, the design of \"MOFA The Ghost\" engages across three dimensions of asymmetry: device asymmetry, by integrating the game interaction utilizing device imbalance power dynamics, MR HMDs and Handheld Augmented Reality (HAR); gameplay asymmetry, through unique roles like the Ghost Controller, Detector, and Ghostbuster, each with specific objectives and limitations; and information asymmetry, fostering a specific limited visual perception with an augmented audiovisual layer for specific roles. Thanks to asymmetry of MR medium, this game encourages all collocated players to be socially competitive and cooperative at the same time. This game illuminates the potential for new design paradigms within spontaneous collocated mixed reality gaming.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Given the ubiquity of videogame play by children, concerns about the impacts of videogames, and increasing evidence of the benefits associated with digital play, it is important to evaluate the player experience (pX) of children. Moreover, it is essential to include children's voices in research about technologies designed for their use. However, eliciting rich, first-hand data on their experiences and perspectives is challenging because it requires children to articulate opinions in a pre-established context of general positivity towards games, alongside potential social desirability bias. In this paper, we present a methodology which uses children's psychophysiology as a prompt for reflective interviews, with two commercial off-the-shelf computer games (Rocket League and LEGO Builder’s Journey). We consider the utility, reproducibility, reliability and validity of the method. In assessing the method, we discuss children’s experience of wearing the sensors, the insights generated from the psychophysiological data, and the understanding that emerged when prompting children to reflect and comment on their own psychophysiological data.",

      "abstract": "Analyzing 3D telemetry data collected from competitive video games on the Internet can support players in improving performance as well as spectators in viewing data-driven narratives of the gameplay. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth qualitative study on the use of telemetry analysis by embedding over several weeks in a virtual F-14A Tomcat squadron in the multiplayer combat flight simulator DCS World (DCS) (2008). Based on formative interviews with DCS pilots, we design a web-based game analytics framework for rendering 3D telemetry from the flight simulator in a live 3Dplayer, incorporating many of the data displays and visualizations requested by the participants. We then evaluate the framework with real mission data from several air-to-air engagements involving the virtual squadron. Our findings highlight the key role of 3Dtelemetry playback in competitive multiplayer gaming",

      "abstract": "While there's growing interest in eliciting situated playful interactions with technologies in different contexts, how these interactions might shape everyday spaces still needs to be fully explored. To address this gap, this article aims to guide the architectural spatial changes by exploring everyday playful interactions of technology-adopted users in domestic spaces. We present our contributions in a two-fold study: First, through an extensive diary study involving 13 technology-adopted residents in gated communities, where distinct boundaries offer increased opportunities for playful interactions, we identified four playful themes: (1) creating and expanding play-spaces, (2) balancing play and comfort, (3) intertwining imagination with spatial experience, and (4) gamifying household interactions. Secondly, by building on these themes, we outline three design implications to inform architectural design processes, aiming to translate everyday playful interactions into tangible spatial changes. These implications include adapting shape-changing and wearable technologies for playful flexibility, embedding new forms of communications within infrastructures, and turning homes into interactive entities with multi-sensory technologies. While these findings provide a starting point for exploring new architectural design possibilities in similar environments, further research with architects, policymakers, and design researchers in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Human-Building Interaction (HBI) fields is essential to actualizing these changes.",

      "abstract": "Over the years, gamification design has become widely discussed in design, services, and human-computer interaction, due to the possibility that experience-centered design can lead to positive user experiences. Consequently, various secondary studies (e.g.,\r\nsystematic mappings, literature reviews, and scoping reviews) were conducted to comprehend how gamification has been designed and implemented. Due to the considerable number of secondary studies, understanding design aspects related to gamification can be challenging. To address this problem, we conducted a tertiary\r\nliterature review to answer three research questions: i) How many game design concepts have been used in literature?; ii) How are the game design concepts classified?; and iii) What are the characteristics of these game design concepts? The results indicated i) a\r\nwide variation in the researched concepts, ii) a noticeable variation in the definition of the concepts, and iii) that these concepts can be divided into two distinct but complementary design classes. Our study contributes to gamification with a classification and categorization system for game design concepts, seeking to improve gamification design methods.",

      "abstract": "Mobile games occupy more market share than PC and console titles combined, while the designers responsible for delighting billions with their app store offerings remain relatively overlooked by avid players and academic researchers alike. Marginalized game developers in particular find themselves struggling to survive in the mammoth mobile marketplace, but few studies have yet to address their unique experiences. In this paper we present the results from a participatory research project to: discover the challenges that women, people of color, LGBTQIA+, and disabled game creators face in the mobile space; and develop actionable methods for dismantling those barriers to meaningful participation in smartphone play design. After summarizing the three most prominent hurdles underrepresented developers contend with, we then lay out ten key insights about how those impediments can be overcome. The piece concludes with a dozen brief proposals for concrete programs to implement a more representative and welcoming mobile gaming environment, and a call to action for us all to take part in building that better world.",

      "abstract": "Game controllers are a crucial element of gameplay experience and agency. Still, they are rarely centered in game livestreaming potentially due to familiarity of users and audiences with them. Within this explorative study-in-progress, we center alternative game controllers, which break with this expectation structures both for player and audience and therefore present new challenges for gameplay structure and technology mediation. To explore this phenomenon, we conducted a video interaction analysis of two Elden Ring livestreams presenting different alternative control modes, a brain-computer-interface (invisible control) and a repurposed Dance Pad (embodied control). It will be shown that the analysed alternative game controllers 1) alter the embodied representation of play, 2) require the adoption of new gameplay structures, and 3) make the development and appearance of evidence practices necessary, to communicate potentially unfamiliar functionality to users.",

      "abstract": "Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human-like characteristics to non-human or inanimate agents. There is little discussion of incorporating anthropomorphic forms in science museums as a popular learning destination. Based on this opportunity and previous research, we designed an AR game featuring anthropomorphized companions in a science museum. This work-in-progress paper explains the design concept of ‘The Adventure in Science Museum’ development, provides a run-down of the early prototype, and discusses the preliminary results of user testing in one of the science museums in Japan. Preliminary results from user testing (n=13) showed that anthropomorphized virtual companions in the science museum were perceived as cute and exciting, and they were able to present science explanations in simple and immersive ways through their conversations with players and other companions.",

      "abstract": "AI is increasingly being used to moderate player behaviour in online multiplayer games, working to identify and respond to toxic and problematic conduct with greater efficiency and accuracy than existing automated systems. However, little work has explored the application of AI moderation in the gaming ecosystem, despite growing ethical concerns about AI applications in other domains. In this study, we conducted 2 expert workshops and interviewed 26 players and industry professionals on their understandings, perceptions and experiences with AI moderation in multiplayer games. Applying a metaphorical frame via template analysis, we outline four metaphors that capture participants’ views on the roles of AI and automation in moderation: the Unreliable Police Force, the Unscrupulous Governor, the Uncaring Judge, and the Untiring Assistant. We discuss these roles as exacerbating a top-down, punitive online justice system and identify ethical concerns around transparency, fairness and inclusion, privacy, and human-AI collaboration. To address these concerns, we put forward a set of ethical design considerations and alternative roles for AI moderation in multiplayer games.",

      "abstract": "Universities have increasingly diverse student populations. While a greater variety of students' backgrounds, skills and abilities exist, this does not necessarily mean they have more inclusive interactions. A lack of inclusive interactions can cause negative biases against people who are different from oneself. One strategy to mitigate bias is exposure to situations where students encounter social dilemmas with others and are stimulated to reflect on their interactions. These experiences could be simulated within a serious game as a safe learning environment. Moreover, serious games allow the player to broaden their mental perspective by showing the world through the eyes of others. This paper presents the design and evaluation of the serious game called Diverse Perspectives. This visual novel with multiple endings captures social dilemmas and allows the player to view them from a different angle through perspective switches. We evaluate Diverse Perspectives with quantitative (N = 32) and qualitative measures on attitude towards diversity and gaming experience measured with the Shortened Version of the Miville-Guzman Universality-Diversity Scale and the Game Experience Questionnaire. Participants indicate they find the perspective switch helpful as it creates an understanding of the other person's view.",

      "abstract": "Regulations require video games to provide transparency regarding loot box odds to keep players informed, leading many games to disclose probabilities in various ways; yet, the extent of players' comprehension of loot box mechanics remains unclear. We performed a content analysis on 80 online posts to understand players' perceptions of loot box odds in two popular video games (Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail). We then conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 players to explore the causes of these folk models across more games. Utilizing a bottom-up open coding approach, we created a taxonomy of folk models players have about loot boxes. We found that participants generally possessed inaccurate mental models of how loot boxes work, and they wanted game companies to enhance loot box transparency in three areas of probability disclosures: granularity, longitude, and scope.

      "abstract": "Cognitive functioning fluctuates throughout the day. Previous work found that the time of day influences player performance in video games. Game designers also frequently leverage day and night cycles in game worlds to create realistic player experiences. It is, however, unclear whether and how the time of day in the game world affects player performance. Hence, we conducted a study with 24 participants who completed a maze game in the late morning or evening, while being immersed in a game world with a corresponding in-game day and night time. We showed that participants had a better memory performance during in-game day time than in-game night time. We also found that participants had a faster overall task completion time during the late morning than evening. Results suggest that not only the real day time but also the virtual day time can influence players' performance. We discuss potential explanations such as lighting conditions and priming effects.",

      "abstract": "Digital games can provide effective recovery from stress, with players turning to a variety of genres—including those with game mechanics that can be considered stressors themselves, i.e., action mechanics. We examine whether action mechanics undermine or facilitate game-based recovery by exposing participants (n=60) to a stress induction, and then having them play a roguelike game in one of three conditions: Combat-Required, Combat-Optional, and Combat-Free. We assess experience through self-report and observed physiological responses. Our findings suggest that gameplay—irrespective of action mechanic intensity—supports the recovery process through the pathways of experienced psychological detachment, control, dominance, and pleasure. Additionally, action mechanics were perceived by participants as particularly promising for mastery recovery experiences—but undermine the recovery pathways of relaxation, as corroborated by experienced arousal and subjective stress. Physiological measures corroborate subjective self-report. We contend that video games featuring action mechanics represent a promising strategy for stress recovery, and may be particularly beneficial in the re-assertion of mastery.",

      "abstract": "Video games are becoming increasingly popular in research, and abundant prior work has investigated this domain by means of \\textit{user studies}. However, carrying out user studies whose population encompasses a large and diverse set of participants is challenging. Crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), represent a cost-effective solution to address this problem. Yet, prior efforts scrutinizing the data-quality (unrelated to gaming) collected via AMT raises a concern: is AMT reliable for game studies? \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we are the first to tackle this question. We carry out three user studies (n=302) through which we evaluate the overall validity of the responses---pertaining to 14 popular video games---we received via AMT. We adopt strict verification mechanisms, which are trivial to ``bypass'' by real gamers, but costly for non-gamers. We found that the percentage of valid responses ranges from 5\\% (for WoW) to 28\\% (for PUBG). We hence advocate future research to carefully scrutinize the validity of responses collected via AMT.",

      "abstract": "General anxiety is a common mental health condition across the world, with many barriers preventing people from accessing treatments. A growing body of evidence suggests that serious games offer appealing and effective solutions for anxiety. Despite their potential, an understanding of game design qualities and contextual game mechanics in game-based interventions are significantly under-explored, especially for general anxiety. Alternative and emerging game genres may offer new intervention approaches previously overlooked in digital mental health research. We use story-led exploration games, particularly the environmental storytelling walking simulator game genre, as an analytical template to understand new game design strategies and features that can potentially enable engaging and efficacious serious games as interventions for general anxiety. Using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis, we summarize input from expert clinical participants who identified and evaluated several game design qualities towards developing walking simulators as potential serious game interventions.",

      "abstract": "Modern digitally-augmented boardgames have, with few exceptions, relied primarily on mobile devices rather than taking advantage of other components such as microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators. What alternative shapes might such games take? And what types of player experiences might such games support? To begin to map out answers to these questions, we collected information about how 31 hobbyist boardgame players envision interacting with technology in future analogue-digital hybrid games, using a rapid idea generation activity. We employed a qualitative content analysis approach to identify their envisioned game components, player interactions with these components, and game effects triggered by these interactions. From this analysis, we constructed a taxonomy of analogue-digital hybrid board games as envisioned by players. This paper uses the taxonomy to organise a detailed discussion of players' imagined interactions. This work thus contributes a player-centric exploration of the design space of hybrid digital-analogue games, with the aim of inspiring new, alternative approaches to boardgame design. Based on the taxonomy, we have additionally released a free and open-source ideation card deck to support new avenues into the design of future hybrid games.",

      "abstract": "Data analytics is commonly used to enable storytelling and enhance esport coverage. One prominent use of it is win prediction, where machine learning models predict the winner of the game before its conclusion. However, predictions are most commonly results of black-box systems, forcing commentators to produce ad-hoc interpretations. Additionally, broadcasters generally rely other metrics to build narratives, limiting the impact of win prediction models for storytelling. This paper explores an alternative method to win prediction, identifying the needs of broadcasters to guide development of a novel win condition model. By focusing on existing storytelling points, the proposed win condition model can offer greater storytelling opportunities to broadcasters, focusing on the user needs identified from within the esport domain. Rather than utilising game state data to predict the winner, as it is usually done in win prediction, the proposed win condition model uses an exploration of the possible winners to predict the game state needed for each team to win. Lastly, the features identified for win condition are evaluated through a series of machine learning models, which provide a data-driven metric to test and predict win condition in the context of Dota 2, a popular esport title.",

Interventions, such as banning players or chat message filtering, can help combat toxicity but are not widely available or even comprehensively studied regarding their approaches and evaluations. We conducted a systematic literature review that provides insights into the current state of interventions literature, outlining their strengths and shortcomings. We identified 36 interventions and qualitatively analyzed their approaches. We describe the types of toxicity being addressed, the entities through which they act, the methods used by intervention systems, and how they are evaluated. Our results provide guidance for future interventions, outlining a design space based on known systems. Furthermore, our findings highlight gaps in the literature, e.g., a sparsity of empirical evaluations, and underexplored areas in the design space, enabling researchers to explore novel directions for future interventions.",

      "abstract": "Today, millions of people worldwide play popular multiplayer online battle arena games (MOBAs) such as League of Legends. MOBAs are designed to require real-time teamwork to win games. A side effect of this is toxic behavior (an umbrella term for various negative in-game behaviors). Following Transactional Stress Theory, in this study, we consider toxicity as a coping mechanism to better deal with in-game stress that leads to anger and frustration, potentially leading to subsequent sleep problems. Therefore, we asked League of Legends players (N=212) about their experiences within the last 30 days in a retrospective survey study. Our results indicated that perceived stress was, indeed, a positive predictor of sleeping problems, and toxic behavior partially mediated this relationship. These results indicate that some of the toxicity is caused by stress in play and that it may increase the likelihood of the occurrence of subsequent sleeping problems. Therefore, further efforts are needed to help players to develop harmonious means and techniques for coping with experienced in-game stress.",

      "abstract": "This study is part of a broader project exploring the integration of Mixed Reality (MR) in fostering prosocial behaviors among children, particularly focusing on interpersonal synchrony (IPS) and its impact on collaboration. IPS, the coordination of rhythmic movements among individuals, has been associated with improved group cohesion and prosocial behaviors, such as collaboration. Traditional assessments of prosociality typically involve structured play activities for dyads, making them difficult to adapt to other settings. To address these limitations, this research aims to design a flexible embodied MR experience that allows children to choose between collaborative or individual engagement, reflecting the natural dynamics of children's play interactions. For this purpose, we conducted an embodied participatory design (PD) and usability study with 50 children aged 8-10 years. We provide a detailed account on how the PD process was orchestrated and an evaluation of user-system interaction, children's perceptions of play modes, and experience satisfaction. The results show how the MR experience, codesigned with children, supports a free play environment, allowing children to choose their preferred play mode. This study highlights the potential of MR in psychological research and child development, providing a new avenue for assessing individual and collaborative behaviors in larger groups of children.",

      "abstract": "Card decks are traditionally used in gaming, providing a tangible and interactive experience that online platforms struggle to replicate. These physical decks foster a sense of connection and immersion that is often lost in digital translations. To bridge this gap, we introduce The Proteus Card Deck. This innovative solution leverages battery-less e-ink displays that function collectively as a single deck, enabling gameplay that mimics the tactile engagement of traditional card games, while allowing players to not be co-located. The Proteus Card Deck stands out by offering a scalable and affordable system, enhancing remote, online gaming experiences by restoring the physicality and presence of traditional card decks.",

      "abstract": "Among athletes and sports fans, it is common to believe that one victory leads to another. Such an effect is known as the hot-hand effect or, simply, a winning streak. This effect was most often associated with traditional sports, however, people participating in electronic sports also tend to believe in it. To explore this venue, we collected 597,680 matches from top players in League of Legends, one of the largest esports games in the world, and analyzed the match data. The findings showed significant but small correlations: winning streaks were associated with improved performance while losing streaks correlated with decreased performance. Players also typically maintained the same champion and lane during winning streaks and tended to switch during losing streaks. Consistency in champion and lane selection was associated with better performance overall. Players also took longer breaks after both winning and losing streaks, which slightly improved performance following losses but had no significant effect after wins. This paper is one of the first ones to test the hot-hand effect with big data in the esports context. Future studies should include players of varying skill levels and regions, incorporate additional performance metrics, and utilize qualitative methods to capture a more comprehensive understanding of player behavior and psychology.",

      "abstract": "India's recent health surveys have highlighted a worrying trend of incomplete child immunization rates across several district clusters in India. Conventional training methods for community healthcare workers (CHWs) in India are inadequate for improving their skills and knowledge. Smartphone games could be a viable and cost-effective method of refresher training specifically targeting immunization practices. A refresher training game was designed both as a physical card-based and digital app-based game, focusing on enhancing CHWs' knowledge and practices related to child immunization. A quasi-experimental study was conducted with 368 participants. Quantitative gameplay analytics and qualitative feedback from players were collected through interviews. The findings show that game-based refresher training significantly improves CHWs' knowledge gain and retention in the area of child immunization. The discussion highlights the study's implications and insights while developing effective digital tools for training CHWs. The research contributes to the growing body of work on digital tools for training CHWs in resource-constrained settings. The study underscores the potential of smartphone games as a scalable and effective method of refresher training for improving child immunization rates.",

      "abstract": "Toxicity in online games refers to behaviors where players disrupt the gaming experience of others, leading to adverse outcomes such as depression and low self-esteem. Although scholars have identified various factors contributing to toxicity, ranging from individual motivations to team dynamics to cultural backgrounds, the role of game design has been less frequently discussed. To bridge this gap, we conducted an interview study to explore players’ perceptions of how game design influences toxicity. Our research identified four game design elements that participants perceived as contributing factors to the emergency of toxicity in their experiences: team interdependency, fairness, interaction design, and privacy. These findings help us shed light on how game design unintendedly triggers toxic intentions, exposes players to vulnerability, making them potential victims, and affects player interactions which lead to toxicity. We further propose design implications that can mitigate toxicity in online games.",

      "abstract": "Simulation training is utilized as part of ultrasound diagnostic practice in medical education. Representative simulation training includes practices using phantoms, Virtual Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR). These methods provide training experiences close to real practice while avoiding direct intervention on patients, thus contributing to the improvement of learners' skills. However, existing simulation training lacks opportunities to learn lesion exploration and clinical decision making in clinical situations where the presence of lesions is uncertain in actual human bodies. Additionally, while these learning experiences take the form of active practice, due to the characteristics of phantoms and VR/AR, they tend to only aid in understanding the appearance of lesions. Although learners improve their adaptability to simulation training through repeated practice, there remains doubt as to whether they acquire skills applicable to clinical settings. To address this issue, we introduce a novel playable design: \\textit{virtual patientization}. We enhance ultrasound images taken from healthy persons with different levels of virtual lesions to achieve more and practical training. Our design extends its capabilities by providing opportunities to practice lesion detection and clinical decision making, thereby enhancing diagnostic skills through real human interaction. Subjective evaluation from medical doctors revealed that for virtual patientization, it is essential to represent critical points in the physician's diagnosis and ensure that no unrealistic events occur, thus clarifying future challenges. We believe that our virtual patientization modality is useful for ultrasound diagnostic education and training and can contribute to improving the quality of healthcare.",

      "abstract": "Mysteries are an engaging form of fiction, capturing audiences with curiosity, uncertainty, and ambiguity. However, mysteries in games have presented a challenge for research since the word mystery may be understood as 1) detective mysteries with clear-cut answers or 2) as mysteries which are unsolvable and incomprehensible. This paper focuses on the latter kind of mysteries. To investigate what constitutes a mystery player experience, in what ways mystery games provide answers to players and how to design these games, we inspected five mystery games through a formalist game analysis by a player-researcher. We discovered (1) how the mystery player experience was characterised by enjoyment of irresolution, state of not receiving clear-cut answers to a mystery, (2) how a mystery condition, a state of wonder and fascination, promoted openness, and (3) how interpretation management represented the doing in the mystery player experience. To our surprise, although the player was driven to find answers to mysteries, the eventual irresolution was an enjoyable experience to the player. We conclude that all mysteries need not be answered during the game, and the experience can be enjoyable because of this.",

      "abstract": "In the ongoing process of the digital transformation of society, corresponding competencies are required from children more than ever. The concept of computational empowerment (CE) promotes confident and reflective engagement with digital technology, which often falls short in formal education. This work outlines how both entertainment and serious games can be used to support the cause of CE and what opportunities they offer for more empowering learning in school settings. The use of digital games appears to be a promising way to connect with the lifeworld of young people and thus offering a low-threshold and differentiated starting point. In this context, the focus should be placed on a stronger establishment of the protagonist role to empower students to engage with digital technologies in depth. \r\nResearch was carried out as part of Serious Game Changers. In this project, students created their own educational modules on specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using digital games and creating new artifacts as learning objects through remixing game elements. In this project, students should be empowered to become active participants by designing with the help of commercial and serious games. Thus giving them their own voice in future (formal) educational settings and promoting future skills in order to make them self-confident \"protagonists\" of their surroundings. ",

      "abstract": "Digital games allow us to adopt the avatar's perspective and experience the (virtual) world from another point of view. The positive effects of such role swaps are well-documented in contexts such as combating racial or ethnic biases. Our work expands this research direction by considering animal avatars: We hypothesize that playing as an animal can improve our attitude towards wildlife and nature. In particular, this manuscript contributes a first systematic study on the effects of animal avatars on players' implicit attitudes towards animals. Our study (N = 78) employs two commercial games featuring different animal avatars, Endling - Extinction is Forever and Bee Simulator, and compares the results of implicit association tests administered before and after gameplay. Our findings confirm significant positive effects of the games on players' implicit associations with foxes and bees. Together with several interesting insights regarding player-avatar relationships and avatar identification, our work paves the groundwork for games contributing positively to societal change.",

      "abstract": "Indie game developers are often defined as game developers who are typically not employed by or affiliated with tech giants or large gaming companies/publishers. Although people may decide to \"go indie\" for various purposes, indie game development has become a crucial part of the global gaming culture. However, this community is now facing unprecedented tensions as generative AI technologies are shifting how games can be designed, produced, and experienced. Through a qualitative analysis of 3,091 online posts and comments from subreddits and Facebook groups for indie game developers, we offer an in-depth investigation of how indie game developers perceive and envision the multifaceted role of generative AI in their creative practices. Our empirical investigation reveals that generative AI both promotes and harms indie game developers’ endeavors to innovate the traditional game production model, which further influences the nature and workflow of creativity in game development. We also propose three principles for designing future generative AI technologies to improve indie developers’ work while mitigating potential risks, harm, and negative impacts of AI. We hope that this study can help design and develop future generative AI technologies to foster and sustain more democratic and inclusive practices in game development rather than replacing human creators.",

      "abstract": "Self-efficacy describes an individual’s perceived capability to accomplish a given task. Self-efficacy theory has long been applied in games for increasing player motivation, performance, and game enjoyment—however, it's not immediately clear how to design or develop a game that promotes self-efficacy. To explore the effects of self-efficacy in the games research domain, we developed Space Oddity, an arcade shooter game. The primary contribution of this work is a framework for designing self-efficacy supporting game elements in the context of shoot 'em up games that stand to support three of self-efficacy theory's antecedents (i.e., mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, and social persuasion). Specifically, we identify progress bars, counters, dynamic difficulty adjustment, juicy visuals and sound effects, usernames, tutorials, gameplay teasers, leaderboards, narrative, ghost replays, encouragement from NPCs, verbal praise, and achievement acknowledgements as likely self-efficacy supporting elements. We also offer insights on our preliminary data analysis, but caution against over-interpretation of these results.",

      "abstract": "The pleasant nature of water and the associated physical and mental health benefits of being in or interacting with water have captivated the interest of human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers - WaterHCI. However, prior WaterHCI work has advanced instrumental contexts, such as improving swimming performance. Consequently, our understanding of the design and use of systems that support interacting with technology in water in more playful contexts is still underdeveloped. This poses the opportunity to advance the design of playful water experiences using interactive technology. This research employs a somaesthetic design method and evaluations of case studies. I design, study, and analyse the user experience of interactive systems, employing extended realities, biosensors and tactile devices, in water. The result will be a framework to guide the future design of playful water experiences that aim to foster the physical and mental benefits of being playful around water.",

      "abstract": "With the necessity of oral communication, traditional games have shown advantages in cultivating players' social skills. Recently with the widespread of consumer-oriented virtual reality devices, remote traditional games have also been introduced to the post-pandemic era. Meanwhile, individual difference in manipulation proficiency can lead to unintended gaps in play skills and thus jeopardize the communication quality between players. To compensate for such gap, we investigate the effectiveness of a facilitative agent. We conducted a Wizard of Oz experiment with an agent that is able to provide handicaps based on the game dynamics. This paper presents an evaluation of the impact of robot facilitator intervention on the improvement of social skills and entertaining, offering insight into novel methodologies for social skill development in an increasingly remote and digital society.",

      "abstract": "End-user security and privacy management is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of modern curricula. Serious games have proven effective in addressing educational gaps both inside and outside a classroom. However, it is challenging to support novice developers in creating impactful security and privacy serious games due to a lack of guidance. In this body of work, we created and tested two serious game design tools. We are currently employing them in a security and privacy themed serious game jam for novice developers. The structure of game jams facilitates rapid introduction of topics and game development, making them ideal for time-constrained developers and classroom settings. This research will provide insight into the effectiveness of the game jam approach and the game design tools for creating security and privacy serious games from the perspective of the developers. The aim is to show that serious games and related tools can serve as effective mechanisms to facilitate end-user awareness and management of security and privacy issues, thereby contributing to a safer digital future.",

Intervention systems have been used in practice and studied in academia, but have not yet succeeded in controlling toxic behavior. Traditionally, intervention systems rely on negative reinforcement like sanctioning to fight undesired behavior, which is often done after an incident has already occurred.

      "abstract": "Colonization has impacted Native Hawaiians for centuries, destroying culture, language, and community, and exacerbating disasters such as COVID-19. However, a renaissance of Hawaiian culture has emerged, marked by increased longevity, education, and social mobility among Native Hawaiians. In this restorative spirit, we present Kaona, a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) and digital storyteller, designed to foster youth wellbeing from a Native Hawaiian perspective, by introducing the values of lōkahi (harmony). Kaona engages players in culturally revitalizing gameplay, integrating technologies to enrich immersion as players collaborate to restore balance to the realms they explore. Players problem-solve, self-reflect, and build community as they navigate complex quests inspired by local lived experiences and Hawaiian mo`olelo (stories and legends). This paper details Kaona’s development, iterative playtesting, and our initial observations, presenting culturally restorative, community-informed RPGs as a promising avenue for empowering Native Hawaiian youth, fostering community wellbeing, and inspiring Indigenous futures.",

      "abstract": "While recent research in social VR have investigated user motivations and group communication, there is a gap in understanding the challenge of digital self-representation and how constraints in avatar customization may impact user self-presentation norms. 48 participants (aged 18-24) were asked to customize an avatar, after which researcher conducted qualitative interviews within the Meta Horizon Worlds VR platform regarding users' satisfaction with their avatars (e.g., skin tone, hair, clothing). Using interview findings (n = 44), we report an in-depth empirical investigation of users' perceptions of avatar representation, realism, and embodiment in VR. Users express a desire to customize avatars that deviate from traditional self-presentation, revealing a conflict between visual self-similarity and embodied self-identification with their avatar. This study contributes to a growing body of literature on social VR avatars that accounts for inclusive representation and self-presentation. We discuss implications and provide recommendations for future social VR platform design and research. ",

      "abstract": "In gaming, human emotion portrayal is the key to a better experience. However, there are significant gender disparities in video game character representation. Men are frequently the main characters, depicting more dominance, with clear emotions, whereas women are often supplementary and overly sexualized with a narrower emotional range. Results showed that 61.5% of female faces and 78% of male faces displayed emotion. Males had less emotional diversification but more frequently exhibited facial emotions than females. This study also analyses moral and ethical personality using the D&D alignment system. Male champions often display anger but are usually neutral for moral alignment. At the same time, female characters are less often morally neutral yet frequently have neutral facial expressions. This discrepancy highlights stereotyping in video game design and suggests the need for future research on its impact and comparisons with other games.",

      "abstract": "Long-term adherence to a Home Exercise Programme (HEP) is a difficult task for many athletes after an Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACLR), making it difficult to go back to play sports. There are some common barriers that contribute to the tendency of patients not continuing with their HEP, like fear of re-injury, boredom, and lack of expectations. In my PhD research, I am using a user-centered approach to determine design guidelines for an immersive VR application for physical therapy, focused on ACL injuries. After identifying the needs of the users, cozy gaming characteristics have been chosen in order to design this application. Initial literature review and feedback has shown that a relaxing and task-oriented game could increase engagement on the prescribed exercises.",

      "abstract": "The relevance and influence of self-avatars in virtual environments have become increasingly evident and widely acknowledged in the research literature. Studies explore how these avatars influence user experiences, engagement, and embodiment across psychological, social, cognitive, and behavioral domains. As virtual reality (VR) technologies continue to evolve and become more integrated into various domains, understanding the role of self-avatars becomes crucial for designing immersive and effective virtual environments that cater to the needs and preferences of users. To address this issue, this study describes a work-in-progress VR educational game. A fundamental aim of this VR educational game is to understand underrepresented minorities' players' learning outcomes when subject to different skin tone avatars in an immersive virtual environment. This project aims to develop a VR game that allows players to choose an avatar character from a validated list of characters or to customize a character with their preferred skin tone that will self-represent them in a virtual environment. This VR educational game will serve as an informal learning platform accessible through VR headsets.",

      "abstract": "Over the years, cognitive assessments have been conducted using pen-and-paper, personal computers, and smartphone applications. As virtual reality (VR) is quickly becoming the next generation of computing, we investigated how it can be used in this field through the development of a game called HoleyMoley. HoleyMoley is a Whac-a-Mole game that combines elements of two commonly used cognitive assessments: a choice reaction task and an emotion recognition task. When we first created HoleyMoley, we largely based it on a computer-based assessment. However, an evaluation with 15 young adults did not reveal any significant findings that we expected from literature. It was not until we integrated multiple modalities — the controller, gaze, and speech — that we were able to recover statistically significant differences in how individuals react to emotional stimuli. This paper details the design process of HoleyMoley as a case study for future cognitive assessment in VR.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the brain and external devices. Electroencephalography(EEG)-based noninvasive BCIs are frequently used for medical applications. These applications allow users with motor dysfunction to control and interact with external devices. Additionally, there is growing interest in using BCIs for able-bodied individuals, particularly in video games. Video games using BCIs have the potential to create novel and engaging modalities for players, enhancing game immersion. In our research, we developed a video game where players control magic using an EEG training method based on onomatopoeias. In this game, Players achieve this by simultaneously recalling the visual imagery of magic and the corresponding onomatopoeic speech imagery while wearing the BCI. This paper evaluates the potential of this method to improve the BCI-controlled video game experience by assessing both BCI performance and overall game experience.The experimental results suggest that the proposed method can achieve stable control performance, with over 60\\% of participants successfully using magic as intended. Additionally, the high ratings of immersion and enjoyment indicate that the high affinity between BCI-based imagery control and onomatopoeia could enhance the player experience.",

Serious Games have become a prominent mobilization force to educate local communities about the impact of climate change and a communities role in climate action. Game designers have utilized diverse narrative and design strategies to convey concepts of climate change to players. Despite the influential role of religion as a game mechanic and its role as a major mobilization force worldwide, there is minimal research on leveraging this powerful motivator in serious games for climate action. In our paper, we use a UX approach to design a climate action game focused on the Hindu religion. In this WIP paper, we detail our methodology, share insights from our ethnographic UX research, introduce a climate change game featuring unique mechanics and narrative, and outline our strategy for evaluating and comparing this newly developed game with existing climate change games.",

      "abstract": " The number of refugees has increased due to political instability and environmental disasters. Upon arrival, refugees encounter various challenges that marginalize them. Studies indicate that fostering empathy can improve the host society's acceptance of refugees. Serious games present a potential method to evoke empathy. Consequently, I investigated game elements designed to evoke empathy by focusing on games that tell the stories of refugees. The findings indicate that decision-making with consequences and branching narratives are particularly effective game mechanics for fostering empathy. Although these mechanics successfully elicited various forms of empathy, instances of contrasting empathy and indications of racism were also noted. This underscores the need for further research on how game mechanics influence players' experiences and emotional responses. Therefore, the next phase will involve conducting a user experience study with refugees and residents.",

Inspired by works of virtual co-embodiment, our game lets two players embody a single avatar, where each player controls half of the body. The gameplay involves walking in a virtual forest and collaboratively interacting with floating fireflies. While moving, poor coordination can lead to unbalanced movements, causing the avatar to lose its center of mass and fall. Such a design might blur the body boundary between players, providing an intriguing bodily experience of interpersonal bodily intertwinement. We hope our work offers novel insights into bodily play where players experience interconnected physical presence within the digital space.",

Personalized gamification, whereby game elements are tailored to individuals’ attributes, has been considered a promising approach. This thesis addresses this issue by first undertaking a systematic review to examine the personalization method in education and its effectiveness. Building upon the review’s findings, three interconnected empirical studies were conducted. Study One conceptualized a new player type model that synthesized existing models, and developed and validated a corresponding questionnaire. Study Two employed cognitive diagnosis models to classify students into nuanced player type profiles, going beyond the dominant player type approach. Study Three experimentally evaluated the effects of personalized gamification on student learning in comparison to the one-size-fits-all approach, and will continue exploring more dynamic personalization methods.",

      "abstract": "Artifacts are vivid carriers of history and culture. Current applications of cultural heritage (CH) education present knowledge from a third-person perspective, potentially overlooking the emotional connection between users and artifacts. This paper introduces the concept of \"Knowledge Actor\", which humanizes artifacts, making them natural first-person narrators of knowledge. For instance, in the game, the glazed porcelain artifact is humanized as a boy. Players evoke his memories and advance the game using key information. To gather key information, players talk with ores to solve the creation puzzle or to the map to get location details, simultaneously deducing, acquiring, and memorizing knowledge. The humanized design and generative AI capabilities seamlessly integrate puzzle-solving gameplay with educational objectives. Experimental results indicate this game design fosters emotional connections between users and artifacts, enhances learning outcomes, and improves the game experience. This paper explores new directions of humanized design and generative AI in CH education.",

      "abstract": "Numerous digital games and media with historical themes aim to educate or engage audiences with heritage. When developing a historical video game, some of the most critical design decisions are centered around finding the balance between an accurate presentation of historical facts and engaging gameplay. This paper examines the game developer's role in selecting and presenting historical content through a case study of a mobile game development process. The design choices and developers' positions related to using historical facts are examined through thematic analysis of interview data and game design documents. Recurring themes in the data reveal a constant interplay between game features and historical content, supported by historical knowledge and technology. In small teams, individual developers often make crucial design decisions while performing multiple roles. As key findings, we report that the resourcing and timing of historical research significantly impacts developers' decisions, and note varying degrees of interest in historical accuracy within the development team.",

      "abstract": "AR can create experiences where digital blends with the physical. It can be used to create new interfaces for other technologies such as digital twins (DTs). In this work in progress we introduce a multiplayer tabletop AR game for Tilt5, that was developed to create a game interface for DT representation of a physical room. The game, Galaxy Escape, follows the escape room metaphor. The game´s purpose is twofold: 1) to be an entertaining game that interfaces with data and 2) to explore the potential of game interfaces for DTs. We conducted a mixed method pilot evaluation with 11 participants. Two groups played the game in a generic office room, while two groups played in the physical representation of the virtual space. The basic usability and user experience were high and some interesting insights can be distilled from co-presence questionnaire and the semi-structured interviews. The results suggest that the physical location has an influence to the player experience, however, the players do not themselves seem to recognize this.",

      "abstract": "Retirement is a significant life event that can have major impacts on well-being. Although demographic changes have led to longer post-retirement periods, the extended lifespan does not guarantee increased quality of life. Older adults may experience increased loneliness, loss of purpose, and adverse health outcomes. To assist older adults in making the transition to retirement, researchers developed a gamified app named EncoreLife, featuring collaborative local activities, digital social interactions, and a reminder system, with the goal of fostering social connections and reestablishing daily life structures. Results from a preliminary user study with four participants indicated that enhanced opportunities for social engagement were the most strongly valued features of the app. Future research is planned to further enhance the interactive features of the app, evaluate its use with a larger and more diverse participant samples, and conduct a longitudinal study of psychological outcomes.",

However, relying solely on subjective post-event indicators fails to capture dynamic emotional changes during the system experience. Kawashima and Watanabe introduced the ``ah-aloud'' method, enabling real-time emotion observation by having participants vocalize ``ah`` during system experiences. However, this method remains conceptual and preliminary, lacking in specific experimental procedures, analysis methods, and utilization guidelines. Our study delineates the requirements for practical ``ah-aloud'' application and validates its potential for game experience assessment. Consequently, the ``ah-aloud'' method demonstrates the potential for observing time-series emotional changes during gameplay. Based on these findings, we deliberated its utility for system evaluation and reliability as an evaluation experiment.",

      "abstract": "Climate change is one of humankind’s grand challenges, and how we think about it influences how we perceive its risks and act. Understanding people's mental models of climate change (that is, how they internally represent it) and potentially challenging and changing them can be a fruitful avenue towards engagement. However, our understanding of how games can affect climate change mental models is limited, especially in the lack of control conditions with comparable content. In this experiment, participants created cognitive maps of climate change before and after experiencing an immersive VR game, a desktop PC game, or a text with graphs. We show that all conditions improved the quality, focus, and systems orientation of cognitive maps, but no significant differences were found between groups. The intervention effectively increased the salience of issues such as health and biodiversity impacts, even though changes were limited in scope. The game was on average more enjoyable than the text, with the VR version significantly more so than the other two conditions. The findings suggest that games can be a viable and attractive communication and learning method where engagement is a struggle. We provide avenues for future research and, especially, game design in this area.",

      "abstract": "There are numerous benefits from regularly walking in nature, and today's mobile technologies have the potential to encourage people to do so. Past research has showed that gamified map-based apps and location-based games (LBGs) have the capability to incentivize people to go to nature areas in cities and beyond. In this study, we explored LBGs' potential to bring people to nature by conducting a field experiment with a new mechanic called Routes in the popular LBG Pokémon GO. Prior to the Route feature's launch, we created altogether 13 Routes of various lengths in both city and nature landscapes. We collected numerical in-game data of how many times each Route was walked and deployed a survey (n=67) for Pokémon GO players in the area where the Routes were made. The findings suggest that proximity to population concentrations and in-game rewards are key drivers of Route popularity. Players' motivators to choose nature Routes over urban Routes were limited to outside-the-game factors such as scenery, and overall in our experiment the urban Routes turned out to be more popular.",

      "abstract": "Dancing provides a powerful way for one to feel connected with others. Virtual Reality (VR) holds the promise of enabling shared dancing experiences over a distance, but major challenges remain. First, the average VR user is limited to moving in a small real-world space; techniques that allow movement in a larger-than-real virtual space all have their limitations. Second, the lack of force feedback, combined with the latency of networking, movement tracking, graphics rendering, and human visuomotor control, makes it difficult to mimic physical interaction such as holding hands---one typically cannot react fast enough to one's dance partner's movements to maintain connection. Third, reliable full-body movement tracking remains beyond reach for affordable consumer VR devices such as Meta Quest. Here, we present a two-player VR contemporary dance game/experience that provides a new solution to these problems. Our solution combines 1) a novel second-person movement manipulation approach where each player only needs a small physical space to move, but their perception of their partner's movement is manipulated to allow the choreography to utilize a large virtual space, 2) a latency-tolerant visual metaphor for connection, in the form of an elastic string connecting the players, and 3) abstract avatar design that only requires tracking the movement of the hands and head and also increases the plausibility of the movement manipulation.",

      "abstract": "Scented media and technology offer a unique way to engage users, specifically to convey information and provide alternative sensory experiences. In addition to serious applications, scents can be used to augment games and playful technologies, enrich the play experience, and evoke specific emotional responses. However, scent can also serve as an effective storytelling tool by itself and be a game narrative mechanism. In this paper, we present the narrative game Scented Days, where we carefully design and showcase the use of olfactory cues to deliver narrative elements and explore the significance of a sense of smell. The game is a scent-focused narrative experience, where the focus is placed on the loss of olfactory senses, a common consequence of COVID-19. This demonstration sheds light on using smell as a game design tool to enhance game narratives, particularly in scenarios involving smell change or loss.",

      "abstract": "Today's videogames are often intertwined with profound religious narratives, content, characters, and artifacts - but how do player communities understand the role of religion in games, and what is the impression of believers on the use, portrayal, and representation of the religion they practice? This paper dives deep into this confluence by rigorously analyzing discussions from religion and videogame subreddits that often depict the most popular communication channel for their communities. Following topic modeling, we cluster posts and comments from the three major religious groups and the most popular related videogame subreddits, bringing forth representative cultural sentiments and patterns of players and religious stakeholders. Through this, we discovered 22 distinct sub-themes, further categorized into the three overarching themes of (a) Blasphemous Elements of Videogames, (b) Religion as a Design Space for Videogames, and (c) Videogames for Religious Education and Community Forming.",

      "abstract": "The interest in enhancing video game interactions through wearable technology has grown, yet accessible gaming with wearables remains underexplored. This study employs participatory design fiction, enabling disabled gamers to envision a future with tailored gaming wearables while critiquing technology. We conducted a two-phase study. Phase one involved in-depth interviews with upper limb motor disability participants; we developed a fictitious gaming wearable by analyzing the data using reflexive thematic analysis. A smaller group iterated on the wearable in phase two to ideate on ideal futures with accessible gaming wearables. Using data and dialogic/performance analysis, we crafted a design fiction diegetic prototype as a tech review video. This research highlights disabled gamers' unique needs and experiences around gaming wearables. It offers an innovative diegetic prototype for accessible gaming tech. Our methodological contribution merges narrative inquiry and dialogic/performance analysis in participatory design fiction research, providing a valuable approach for future studies.",

      "abstract": "Mobile games have become highly popular and profitable. While much work has been done to understand deceptive patterns of games and some unethical practices they apply, little is known about fake games, an emergent phenomenon in mobile gaming. To answer this question, we conducted two studies: a walkthrough method to characterize fake games, and a thematic analysis of user reviews to gain understanding from the user perspective. We found five types of misalignments that render a game fake and identified four primary facets of player experience with fake games. These misalignments act as realization points in the users' decision-making to define games as being fake. We discuss the fakeness of fake games, how the formation of an ecosystem helps with the circulation of fakeness, as well as challenges to governing fake games. Lastly, we propose implications for research and design on how to mitigate and identify fake games.",

      "abstract": "An increasing number of game platforms, such as Roblox, enable game creators to develop user-generated games (UGGs). Yet, these platforms often come under scrutiny for hosting UGGs that contain harmful content, ranging from sexually explicit material to Nazi-themed roleplay. Limited attention has been paid to how harmful UGGs are ideated by game creators. To address this question, we studied an online Roblox creator community, where Roblox creators collectively engage in design ideation to brainstorm design ideas for UGGs. Through an inductive thematic analysis, we found three primary ways where Roblox creators’ design ideation becomes risky, including how Roblox creators generate risky game design ideas, navigate through policy boundaries to develop these ideas, and share strategies of bypassing moderation. Based on our findings, we discuss ethical and governance challenges facing user-generated games. We propose design implications to support game creators in developing ethical game design ideas and safe game designs.",

      "abstract": "In gamification users show increased motivation and engagement towards tasks. So far, this effect has mostly been empirically tested based on the visual depiction of game elements, while research on the use and addition of auditory aspects is sparse. In this work we investigate the effect of different modalities of game elements (auditory, visual, audiovisual) on user experience, perception and performance in a gamified image-tagging task. We approached this via an online validation survey to find suitable sound effects (N=50), a main quantitative study (N=109) and a qualitative semi-structured interview (N=9). Our results show that while visual gamification increases performance, auditory and audiovisual gamification had no effect. However, they were shown to have an influence on the user's flow state. Our qualitative follow-up study shed light on underlying reasons and revealed each modality has its own drawbacks and advantages and that combining both visual and auditory aspects was preferred by participants.",

I connect this phenomenon to the difficulty within the practice to go beyond individualistic ways of ensuring credibility grounded on the authority of the designer, and the focus on new playful and creative methods to engage stakeholders in critical co-design activities. I conclude this essay arguing for the potential use of the concept of \"kitsch\" to think and initiate a discussion about the current state of the methodology and the steps we could take to ensure its criticality.",

      "abstract": "The extant scholarship on player toxicity in multiplayer online games has focused on the harms that it causes to players, communities, and developers, and has assumed, that it is in the interest of all key stakeholders to mitigate such behaviors. Both research and practice have developed measures to combat and curb toxicity, yet these actions appear insufficient since negative behaviors persist. In this paper, we examine the relationship between players' propensity to engage in toxic behaviors and their in-game purchasing behavior. For this, we collected data from 204 League of Legends players and performed a multiple regression analysis using demographics, controls, and toxic behavior as independent variables to explain the dependent variable purchase behavior. This analysis revealed a positive relationship between self-reported toxic behavior and purchase behavior. This finding suggests that while developers may wish to get rid of toxicity, it is not in their financial interests to ban toxic players altogether. This, in part, may explain the persistence and prevalence of toxicity in multiplayer online games. Future research may look into characteristics such as deficient self-regulation as potential explanations for the positive correlation between toxicity and purchase behavior.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces Shroom Cards, a novel tool designed to engage with More-than-Human (MtH) design through playful exploration and reflection. Leveraging design cards and structured activities, Shroom Cards provides concrete starting points to practically engage with MtH approaches in design, such as embodying the roles and purposes of human and non-human entities. In this paper, we detail the design process, which includes Reflective Design Studio exercises to create positionality cards and incorporating playful strategies such as exploration, role-playing, and competition in the structured ideation and reflection activities. Initial testing of the Shroom Cards in an HCI design course students (N=23) shows that the cards and ideation activity effectively stimulate creative processes and diverse perspectives. However, challenges remain in fully adopting non-human viewpoints, suggesting that enhanced role-playing elements are needed for deeper engagement with non-human perspectives.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss concepts in games for and beyond entertainment to promote innovative designs in learning games. When it comes to designing learning games, pedagogies are regarded as a standalone field. This means that global pedagogical theories, including those outside the context of learning games, can be investigated. These theories are crucial for creating efficient learning experiences. Similarly, we argue that games should be investigated holistically, as a field spanning beyond learning games, to design engaging game experiences in learning games. Studies on games for entertainment can enrich the design of games beyond entertainment with new nuances and approaches.\r\nOn these grounds, we explore a new perspective on failure inspired by Game Studies, shedding light on the concept of \"intrinsically integrated games\" in the game-based learning discipline. Next, we design a game prototype in which the failure state is used to turn notional failure into a playful learning activity. Subsequently, we briefly introduce a pilot experiment. The experiment was conducted with a functional version of the prototype in Spring 2024 to demonstrate that misspelling and mispronunciation—viewed as failures—can enhance engagement and be a valuable part of games for beginner readers.\r\n",

Our research, in collaboration with the Landestheater Linz, demonstrates how digital technologies can enhance traditional theater, making it more appealing to audiences through real-time audience interaction and extended reality elements. During the project, both the opportunities and challenges were discovered, emphasizing the need for technical expertise, iterative development, and collaborative workflows. Expert interviews underscore the importance of a common language between technical and artistic teams and reveal the educational potential of digital theater. This research lays the groundwork for future developments in digital theater, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional theatrical methods and modern digital capabilities.",

      "abstract": "The addition of LiDAR sensors to consumer smartphones and tablets, such as iPhone 12 and later models, has enabled users to generate and collect point cloud data of their physical environment. We present an interactive augmented reality (AR) game designed and developed to guide the user to move their smartphone in a way that (1) yields usable point cloud data and (2) is enjoyable. In the game, the user pilots an alien spacecraft that has come to Earth to retrieve \"data collecting units\" scattered around the physical environment. Through gameplay, it is possible to record a wide range of data automatically generated by the mobile device, such as point cloud and mesh data of the surrounding environment as well as the device's movement. Preliminary testing among the developers in forest environments shows promising findings in terms of both (1) the generated data and (2) the enjoyability of the user experience. We discuss these findings and propose avenues for future research.",

      "abstract": "In this Work-in-Progress (WiP), we present GravField (short for \"Gravitational Field\"), an experimental and participatory inter-bodily live-coding performance system in a collocated Mixed Reality (MR) environment. Participants wearing MR headsets are invited to join and collectively create real-time music through their collaborative body movements, guided by the programmed settings from live-coders. This innovative experiment harnesses intercorporeal signals derived from participants' body movements, including factors like distance, area formation, relative height differences, and head motion synchronization. Live-coders dynamically map these signals into metaphorical audiovisual patterns in MR, providing participants with cues about the relationships between players. The live-coded patterns shape and influence participants' improvisation of body movements, while adjustments in live coding dynamically alter how these movements generate sound, influencing the overall improvisational experience. Additionally, spectators outside the live performance area can enjoy the mixed reality performance through projection screens and TVs, enhancing audience engagement. This WiP aims to explore the vast potential of intercorporeal signals, creating a communicative, playful, and co-creative space where players' interconnected bodies become the instruments of expression.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Walking is one of the most natural ways to explore an environment. While Virtual Reality (VR) facilities simulation of infinite spaces, its limited by the physical space available. To address this limitation, several techniques have been proposed, such as redirected walking, walking in place, and teleportation. While some of these techniques, such as teleportation and walking in place, disrupt the natural immersion, others like redirected walking limit the walkable area within the virtual space. The concept of overlapping architecture tackles this challenge by compressing large virtual environments into smaller spaces. This is achieved by generating portions of an environment that might be physically impossible as a whole. In this paper, we propose a system for creating maze-based virtual environments with multi-path capabilities. This system allows for infinite natural walking experiences while maintaining architectural consistency. Specifically, our system can generate distinct, customizable, and scalable virtual mazes for physical areas exceeding 4x4 meters. The combination of multi-path capabilities and architectural consistency can enhance the overall maze traversal experience for end users.",

      "abstract": "The metaverse and extended reality (XR) environments are becoming increasingly prominent in everyday life, catalyzed by investments from major companies like Apple, Meta, and Google. These immersive environments offer new platforms for interaction, particularly through games and play, which provide unique opportunities for identity formation and expression. This panel explores the complex dynamics of digital identity in XR, focusing on how users create and navigate identities within gaming contexts. It addresses key questions about the overlap and discrepancies between real and virtual identities, the tools and technologies that facilitate identity expression, and the new modalities of emotional and psychological engagement in XR. Featuring experts from industry and academia, the discussion aims to bridge the gap between traditional social media and immersive XR experiences, providing insights into the future of digital identity. The panel will delve into how companies not traditionally involved in gaming can leverage gaming principles to enhance identity formation and communication in the metaverse. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of identity dynamics in XR, practical insights for designing inclusive environments, and opportunities for networking and further research.",

      "abstract": "Toxicity and hate are on the rise both offline in political rhetoric and civic discourse and online on social platforms and in digital playgrounds that, by design, convert our connections from relationships to transactions. In the case of online games, player safety is now a pressing academic and industry concern, with 76% of adults and 37% of minors experiencing toxicity, hate and harassment, including extremist and white supremacy rhetoric [1]. Our research lab has been investigating these issues over the last three years, focusing particularly on the experiences of adolescents (ages 13-25) and possible solutions to our shared problem of community. Growing out of research on school-affiliated teen esports programs (NASEF) and their academic and social-emotional impacts on youth, which revealed some of the dynamics of tilt and toxicity and the transformative role of coaches and peer mentors, this research adopted a tripartite model assuming that all online players, at some time or another, have been not only bystanders and victims to harmful behaviors but also, even if rarely admitted, perpetrators as well. \nIn this presentation, I review our most recent findings on exposure to toxicity and hate in online games, adolescent players’ attitudes and responses to such behavior, and understanding of its real-world consequences. I then explore the question of whether and how online game platforms may normalize toxicity and hate, not by overt design but by negligently steeping players in dysregulated environments that, over time, inculcate players into forms of rhetoric and behavior harmful to themselves and others. The solution, I argue, is not merely ideational but relational: From a sociocultural perspective on cognition and learning, belief change occurs through interactions with others in joint activity through which individuals calibrate one another to new representations and interpretations of the world. Cultural tools and artifacts mediate this process, but their meaning is culturally defined, not natural fact. In this light, our liberators will not be the games industry but we the players ourselves. Here, I sketch a generalizable approach to addressing the issues we now face, one based on reconnection, reconciliation, and recognition of the fact that, in a world designed to convince us that our value can be measured in likes, currency, and clicks, we are all only temporarily abled, conjecturally benevolent, and occasionally whole. These shortcomings, however, are indeed the very source of our shared cure: connection. And it is on the basis of such connection that we literally shape and change other people’s minds – through a kind of radical hospitality or radical kinship [2] that recognizes that belonging comes first, beliefs second. There is no other, only us. And joint play is one of our most potent vehicles.",

      "abstract": "Performed storytelling is a human impulse, one we can trace to the beginning of recorded time, starting with theatre and moving more recently to celluloid, television and the streaming platforms we enjoy in our own homes. Video Games are a spritely addition to this entertainment landscape, and they come with added value: active involvement in play. Like storytelling, games are embedded in the human experience. We reach for structured activities that reward us with challenge, pleasure and fun. It was only a matter of time before storytelling and gameplay found each other. Twenty years after the arrival of the first computer game, the joy of play was augmented by the introduction of narrative. Engaging characters escorted the player from one plot-point to the next, adding value to their gaming experience. Built upon my own personal and professional experiences as both an actor and a voice artist for multiple high profile video games in the past decade, this keynote will explore how, with the arrival of video games, the landscape of storytelling has changed forever. How does the art of performance, steeped in nearly 2000 years of tradition, sit with the demands of this new upstart? What do actors and developers alike need to consider when the formally passive witness to performance, the audience, is now also the player? And what awaits in the future? As we head directly into an era full of technological possibilities and challenges for the creative sector such as game production, how will AI generated performances impact the players of games, as well as the creative input of those who make them?",

Our goal for this workshop is, thus, to bring together researchers and professionals working in the spaces of game human–computer interaction (HCI), game data and AI, and ethics in both games and AI to discuss and identify interdisciplinary research opportunities and devise potential solutions to existing problems.

      "abstract": "Cybersecurity campaigns often fail because tools and practices, like password managers, appear too daunting or difficult to implement. While prior work has shown that transformational game design approaches to improving players’ security self-efficacy can show promise in encouraging more secure behaviors in players, we still lack a systematic understanding of how and why these features work, or how these approaches differ in their impact on players’ behavior change. This paper presents and describes the design and implementation of a transformational game called C.A.L.Y.P.S.O., incorporating 12 dynamically toggle-able design patterns inspired by Bandura’s principles for self-efficacy design in order to encourage users’ adoption of expert-recommended cybersecurity tools and best practices. These 12 design patterns consist of self-efficacy design features explored in other work, and other techniques of the authors’ own design. The goal of this work is to draw on psychological theories of self-efficacy to develop design patterns that can be translated to other contexts to enhance end-user cybersecurity behaviors and to build a game that will enable researchers to assess the effectiveness of these design patterns in comparison to one another.",

      "abstract": " As social media becomes increasingly integral to science communication, there is a rising interest in blending education with entertainment to captivate the public. This paper presents the design of a virtual reality (VR) experience that strategically employs engagement strategies such as anticipation, surprise, juiciness, and agency, aimed at enhancing learning within science education. Leveraging the immersive capabilities of VR, the virtual environment seeks to adapt these social media elements to examine their potential in boosting engagement and learning. The VR experience will be used in an experiment featuring a controlled design, varying levels of interaction and sensory feedback to evaluate their influence on participants' understanding of scientific concepts. By integrating these engaging elements, the experiment anticipates enhancing the educational utility of VR, guiding the development of more effective VR educational tools and broadening the appeal and accessibility of science learning for diverse audiences.",

      "abstract": "There are games designed to teach binary to decimal number conversion; however, this is typically done through single-player games or multiplayer games that focus on solving puzzles faster or playing against the systems. However, these games do not focus on creating conflict to generate challenges, which in turn aid in achieving the flow state. Thus, we designed ‘Error 409’, a multiplayer endogenous game, by introducing challenges through conflict. Our design goal was to mix physical and digital environments to create a portable game that can be played anywhere. ‘Error 409’ requires players to achieve their secret number(s) given by the Console to each player by switching bits (on/off) using a common switch panel available for both players. ‘Error 409’ will improve students’ knowledge and understanding of conversions from binary to decimal. This portable game may act as a catalyst to spark children's interest in fundamental computer science concepts through meaningful physical interactions.",

      "abstract": "Therapy involving paper folding-based fine motor activities has proven effective for children with autism. However, the lack of professional special education training makes it challenging for parents to create suitable guided activities that motivate their children during home sessions. To address this, we introduce \\textit{Foldiverse}, an AR game-based solution. Providing paper folding tutorials and real-time interactive feedback, it transforms paper folding into an interactive virtual life. The gamification approach stimulates children's interest and enables parents to easily accompany the training at home. User experiments have shown that \\textit{Foldiverse} significantly increases children's engagement and anticipation, providing a more gamified and family-inclusive training method for autism rehabilitation.",

      "abstract": "How can blind and sighted individuals play together? The natural disparity in visual abilities often poses challenges for fair competition in social play. This can diminish the confidence of visually impaired (VI) individuals and reduce engagement for sighted players. While previous literature has incorporated fairness design strategies for the VI, we additionally aim to address the potential problem of boredom for sighted players by providing enhanced visual feedback without compromising fairness as a novel design strategy. We present \"Hearing the Bullseye\", an archery exergame designed for harmonious play between VI individuals and their sighted family and friends. Players use a bow equipped with an infrared sensor, allowing them to target an unseen bullseye using sound rather than sight. An empirical study involving 18 sighted and VI participants demonstrated that the design strategies used in  \"Hearing the Bullseye\" effectively promote social engagement among both groups while ensuring fair competition.",

SoundTrek also employs sound design strategies, such as spatialized soundtracks and near-field audio to aid spatial navigation in the absence of visual cues and to create unique aesthetic experiences through sound. We present new ways of utilizing sound in virtual reality game design that highlights design considerations for audio-focused gameplay and diversifies the opportunities for creating rich, interactive soundscapes.",

      "abstract": "An esker is a geological formation created by a melting glacier, as subglacial streams of meltwater continuously add layers of gravel. A 3D printer crafts by adding layers of molten streams of plastic, in a continuous additive fabrication process. We designed the game ‘Playing Esker’, a strategy game where two players compete over the gradual printing of esker formations. Following a research-through-game-design approach, we document how additive material fabrication processes can be used as gamespaces, highlighting 3 themes for Additive Games: (1) Additive turn-taking, where we explored playful turn-based interactions with the printer. (2) Material constraints, where we treated material limitations as game mechanics. (3) Earth-procedurality, where we used procedural generation in combination with additive games to engage players with the unpredictable formations of the esker. Lastly, we reflect on geophilosophical and geological ideas, which we used as generative lenses to inspire new and alternative forms of world-building. By emphasising the earth and world-formation processes through gameplay, geophilosophy can inspire new modes of non-human world-building, agency and territoriality in games.",

      "abstract": "‘NEXT!’ is an interactive installation and video game inspired by the personal ancestry of one of our team members. The game explores themes of family obligations, filial piety, and the sacrifices made for love within the context of traditional Chinese culture. Utilizing computer vision and original audiovisual media, 'NEXT!' guides players through an emotional journey based on real-life experiences. This paper details the game's concept, interactive and technological innovations, and research findings. Through user testing and iterative design, we examine the alignment between the impact of the game mechanics on the perceived user experience and the designed narrative arc, transitioning from anxiety and duty to fun and emotional confrontation. The game effectively combines various design elements while addressing important cultural themes.",

      "abstract": "Dancing provides a powerful way for one to feel connected with others. Virtual Reality (VR) holds the promise of enabling shared dancing experiences over a distance, but major challenges remain. First, the average VR user is limited to moving in a small real-world space; techniques that allow movement in a larger-than-real virtual space all have their limitations. Second, the lack of force feedback, combined with the latency of networking, movement tracking, graphics rendering, and human visuomotor control, makes it difficult to mimic physical interaction such as holding hands---one typically cannot react fast enough to one's dance partner's movements to maintain connection. Third, reliable full-body movement tracking remains beyond reach for affordable consumer VR devices such as Meta Quest. Here, we present a two-player VR contemporary dance game/experience that provides a new solution to these problems. Our solution combines 1) a novel second-person movement manipulation approach where each player only needs a small physical space to move, but their perception of their partner's movement is manipulated to allow the choreography to utilize a large virtual space, 2) a latency-tolerant visual metaphor for connection, in the form of an elastic string connecting the players, and 3) abstract avatar design that only requires tracking the movement of the hands and head and also increases the plausibility of the movement manipulation.",

      "abstract": "Retirement is a significant life event that can have major impacts on well-being. Although demographic changes have led to longer post-retirement periods, the extended lifespan does not guarantee increased quality of life. Older adults may experience increased loneliness, loss of purpose, and adverse health outcomes. To assist older adults in making the transition to retirement, researchers developed a gamified app named EncoreLife, featuring collaborative local activities, digital social interactions, and a reminder system, with the goal of fostering social connections and reestablishing daily life structures. Results from a preliminary user study with four participants indicated that enhanced opportunities for social engagement were the most strongly valued features of the app. Future research is planned to further enhance the interactive features of the app, evaluate its use with a larger and more diverse participant samples, and conduct a longitudinal study of psychological outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Envisioning a future with prevalent use of Mixed Reality (MR) Head-mounted Displays (HMD), introducing MR headsets into public and social spaces creates complex social challenges. The first challenge is the inherent power imbalance between collocated HMD wearers and non-wearers, where non-wearers cannot see what HMD wearers see. The second challenge is the inherent asymmetry of MR experiences between collocated HMD wearers, where each HMD wearer can only see their MR digital objects privately, perceiving their own version of reality. How can we leverage the imbalances and asymmetry of the MR medium into game elements for a unique gaming experience? This demonstration introduces \"MOFA The Ghost,\" an asymmetric inter-bodily mixed reality social exertion game inspired by the cinematic classic, Ghostbusters. Based on spontaneous collocated mixed reality technology, the design of \"MOFA The Ghost\" engages across three dimensions of asymmetry: device asymmetry, by integrating the game interaction utilizing device imbalance power dynamics, MR HMDs and Handheld Augmented Reality (HAR); gameplay asymmetry, through unique roles like the Ghost Controller, Detector, and Ghostbuster, each with specific objectives and limitations; and information asymmetry, fostering a specific limited visual perception with an augmented audiovisual layer for specific roles. Thanks to asymmetry of MR medium, this game encourages all collocated players to be socially competitive and cooperative at the same time. This game illuminates the potential for new design paradigms within spontaneous collocated mixed reality gaming.\r\n",

      "abstract": "The importance of coping with stress for adolescents is well documented. Various approaches to providing stress-coping strategies have been proposed, and mindfulness has been one of the commonly introduced techniques. It has shown clinical evidence of effectiveness, and questionnaires measuring its efficiency have been developed as well. However, the majority of current methods take a conventional approach of involving verbal or text-based explanations of mindfulness practices, which suffer from a distinct lack of engagement and long-term adherence. However, there are still limited methods for introducing mindfulness to adolescents. In order to make mindfulness not only more accessible for teens but also more engaging and effective, we introduce Fido’s Therapy, an interactive narrative empathy game that involves players in three different mindfulness techniques, making the learning process more enjoyable and relatable to their daily experiences. In Fido’s Therapy, players follow the story of a teenage student who faces common stress factors of adolescence. The game is designed to keep players engaged and present mindfulness techniques as game mechanics that naturally allow players to practice mindfulness.",

      "abstract": "Tingbao is a collaborative project celebrating the beauty of nature and its ability to inspire young imaginations. It is an ongoing exploratory collaboration that fostered multiple synergies between the authors; Dreamsailors Collective: consisting of Richard Navarro, Paul Cheneour and Cass XuXin; the illustrator Greg Stobbs, and several other artists, technologists, and musicians. By combining music, visual art, and technology our work tells a tale about the natural world's magic and vulnerability through diverse interactive outputs. \r\n\r\nAt the CHI Play interactivity track, we are excited to showcase the VR prototype, one of the outcomes of the collaboration, teleporting the audience into the world of the artists and the music in an immersive and interactive way. We hope to create a space that encourages playful exploration and discovery of our work.",

      "abstract": "The addition of LiDAR sensors to consumer smartphones and tablets, such as iPhone 12 and later models, has enabled users to generate and collect point cloud data of their physical environment. We present an interactive augmented reality (AR) game designed and developed to guide the user to move their smartphone in a way that (1) yields usable point cloud data and (2) is enjoyable. In the game, the user pilots an alien spacecraft that has come to Earth to retrieve \"data collecting units\" scattered around the physical environment. Through gameplay, it is possible to record a wide range of data automatically generated by the mobile device, such as point cloud and mesh data of the surrounding environment as well as the device's movement. Preliminary testing among the developers in forest environments shows promising findings in terms of both (1) the generated data and (2) the enjoyability of the user experience. We discuss these findings and propose avenues for future research.",

      "abstract": "Research on digital games has focused on engagement, often treating disengagement as a consequence of flawed game design and\r\ntherefore undesirable. We want to explore disengagement in a different light, as we believe it can lead to an overall more positive\r\nplayer experience through closure and satisfaction. The end of a game session can often lead to conflict between children and their\r\nparents/guardians, which we believe can be reduced by proper disengagement built directly into the game design. Disengagement\r\nfrom digital games has not been explored with children in previous research, leaving a gap that we want to fill. Our demo Snarky’s\r\nAdventure tries to explore this by centering key design decisions around ending the game session after a selected amount of playtime\r\nand easing the player out. This can be used to explore different effects on the player experience that result from in-game communication\r\nof remaining play time and additional closure features.",

      "abstract": "Scented media and technology offer a unique way to engage users, specifically to convey information and provide alternative sensory experiences. In addition to serious applications, scents can be used to augment games and playful technologies, enrich the play experience, and evoke specific emotional responses. However, scent can also serve as an effective storytelling tool by itself and be a game narrative mechanism. In this paper, we present the narrative game Scented Days, where we carefully design and showcase the use of olfactory cues to deliver narrative elements and explore the significance of a sense of smell. The game is a scent-focused narrative experience, where the focus is placed on the loss of olfactory senses, a common consequence of COVID-19. This demonstration sheds light on using smell as a game design tool to enhance game narratives, particularly in scenarios involving smell change or loss.",

      "abstract": "Card decks are traditionally used in gaming, providing a tangible and interactive experience that online platforms struggle to replicate. These physical decks foster a sense of connection and immersion that is often lost in digital translations. To bridge this gap, we introduce The Proteus Card Deck. This innovative solution leverages battery-less e-ink displays that function collectively as a single deck, enabling gameplay that mimics the tactile engagement of traditional card games, while allowing players to not be co-located. The Proteus Card Deck stands out by offering a scalable and affordable system, enhancing remote, online gaming experiences by restoring the physicality and presence of traditional card decks.",
