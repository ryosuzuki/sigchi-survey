      "abstract": "Improving medication management for older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) requires designing systems that support functional independence and provide compensatory strategies as their abilities change. Traditional medication management interventions emphasize forming new habits alongside the traditional path of learning to use new technologies. In this study, we navigate designing for older adults with gradual cognitive decline by creating a conversational “check-in” system for routine medication management. We present the design of MATCHA -Medication Action To Check-In for Health Application, informed by exploratory focus groups and design sessions conducted with older adults with MCI and their caregivers, alongside our evaluation based on a two-phased deployment period of 20 weeks. Our results indicate that a conversational “check-in” medication management assistant increased system acceptance while also potentially decreasing the likelihood of accidental over-medication, a common concern for older adults dealing with MCI.",

In this work we provide a first step towards filling this gap through an interview study with fourteen people with mild to moderate dementia. Our analysis yields insights into mobile phone use by people with mild to moderate dementia, challenges they experience with mobile phone use, and their ideas to address these challenges. Based on these findings, we discuss design opportunities to help achieve more accessible and supportive technology use for people with dementia. Our work opens up new opportunities for the design of systems focused on augmenting and enhancing the abilities of people with dementia. ",

      "abstract": "Measures of human performance for touch-based systems have focused mainly on overall metrics like touch accuracy and target acquisition speed. But touches are not atomic - they unfold over time and space, especially for users with limited fine motor function, for whom it can be difficult to perform quick, accurate touches. To gain insight into what happens during a touch, we offer 15 target-agnostic touch metrics, most of which have not been mathematically formalized in the literature. They are touch direction, variability, drift, duration, extent, absolute/signed area change, area variability, area deviation, area extent, absolute/signed angle change, angle variability, angle deviation, and angle extent. These metrics regard a touch as a time series of ovals instead of a mere (x, y) coordinate. We provide mathematical definitions and visual depictions of our metrics, and consider policies for calculating our metrics when multiple fingers perform coincident touches. To exercise our metrics, we collected touch data from 27 participants, 15 of whom reported having limited fine motor function. Our results show that our metrics effectively characterize touch behaviors including fine-motor challenges. Our metrics can be useful for both understanding users and for evaluating touch-based systems to inform their design.",

Despite the importance of understanding such harms, little work has been done to examine how disabled people are discriminated against online. We address this gap by investigating how disabled people experience ableist microaggressions on social media and how they respond to and cope with these experiences. By conducting interviews with 20 participants with various disabilities, we uncover 12 archetypes of ableist microaggressions on social media, reveal participants' coping mechanisms, and describe the long-term impact on their wellbeing and social media use. Lastly, we present design recommendations, re-evaluating how social media platforms can mitigate and prevent these harmful experiences.",

Although existing assistive technologies enable people with upper-body motor impairments to use different input modalities to interact with computing devices independently (e.g., using voice to interact with a computer), many people still require Personal Care Assistants (PCAs) to perform ADLs. Multimodal input has the potential to enable users to perform ADLs without human assistance. We conducted 12 semi-structured interviews with people who have upper-body motor impairments to capture their existing practices and challenges of performing ADLs, identify opportunities to expand the input possibilities for assistive devices, and understand user preferences for multimodal interaction during everyday tasks. Finally, we discuss implications for the design and use of multimodal input solutions to support user independence and collaborative experiences when performing daily living tasks.",

      "abstract": "As they develop comprehension skills, American Sign Language (ASL) learners often view challenging ASL videos, which may contain unfamiliar signs. Current dictionary tools require students to isolate a single sign they do not understand and input a search query, by selecting linguistic properties or by performing the sign into a webcam. Students may struggle with extracting and re-creating an unfamiliar sign, and they must leave the video-watching task to use an external dictionary tool. We investigate a technology that enables users, in the moment, i.e., while they are viewing a video, to select a span of one or more signs that they do not understand, to view dictionary results. We interviewed 14 American Sign Language (ASL) learners about their challenges in understanding ASL video and workarounds for unfamiliar vocabulary. We then conducted a comparative study and an in-depth analysis with 15 ASL learners to investigate the benefits of using video sub-spans for searching, and their interactions with a Wizard-of-Oz prototype during a video-comprehension task. Our findings revealed benefits of our tool in terms of quality of video translation produced and perceived workload to produce translations. Our in-depth analysis also revealed benefits of an integrated search tool and use of span-selection to constrain video play. These findings inform future designers of such systems, computer vision researchers working on the underlying sign matching technologies, and sign language educators.",

The advent of refreshable tactile displays (RTDs) offers the potential for blind people to access tactile animations for the very first time. A survey of touch readers and vision accessibility experts revealed a high level of enthusiasm for tactile animations, particularly those relating to education, mapping and concept development. Based on these suggestions, a range of tactile animations were developed and four were presented to 12 touch readers. The RTD held advantages over traditional tactile graphics for conveying movement, depth and height, however there were trade-offs in terms of resolution and textural properties. This work offers a first glimpse into how refreshable tactile displays can best be utilised to convey animated graphics for people who are blind.",

      "abstract": "Traditional symbol-based AAC devices impose meta-linguistic and memory demands on individuals with complex communication needs and hinder conversation partners from stimulating symbolic language in meaningful moments. This work presents a prototype application that generates situation-specific communication boards formed by a combination of descriptive, narrative, and semantic related words and phrases inferred automatically from photographs. Through semi-structured interviews with AAC professionals, we investigate how this prototype was used to support communication and language learning in naturalistic school and therapy settings.\r\nWe find that the immediacy of vocabulary reduces conversation partners' workload, opens up opportunities for AAC stimulation, and facilitates symbolic understanding and sentence construction.\r\nWe contribute a nuanced understanding of how vocabularies generated automatically from photographs can support individuals with complex communication needs in using and learning symbolic AAC, offering insights into the design of automatic vocabulary generation methods and interfaces to better support various scenarios of use and goals.",

      "abstract": "COVID-19 accelerated the trend toward remote software development, increasing the need for tightly-coupled synchronous collaboration. Existing tools and practices impose high coordination overhead on blind or visually impaired (BVI) developers, impeding their abilities to collaborate effectively, compromising their agency, and limiting their contribution. To make remote collaboration more accessible, we created CodeWalk, a set of features added to Microsoft’s Live Share VS Code extension, for synchronous code review and refactoring. We chose design criteria to ease the coordination burden felt by BVI developers by conveying sighted colleagues’ navigation and edit actions via sound effects and speech. We evaluated our design in a within-subjects experiment with 10 BVI developers. Our results show that CodeWalk streamlines the dialogue required to refer to shared workspace locations, enabling participants to spend more time contributing to coding tasks. This design offers a path towards enabling BVI and sighted developers to collaborate on more equal terms.",

While speech-enabled technologies are widespread, using one's voice as a computing modality introduces new accessibility challenges for people with speech disfluencies such as stammering (also known as stuttering). This paper investigates the smart speaker user experiences of people who stammer over three weeks. We conducted diary studies and semi-structured interviews with 11 individuals to identify their daily routines, difficulties with successful interactions, and strategies to overcome these barriers. Our analysis demonstrates key factors such as device location, its affordances, and the structure of commands had a strong impact on user experience. Participants highlighted different linguistic strategies to try and overcome interaction difficulties and discussed the potential of using smart speakers for speech and language therapy. We emphasise the need to further understand the experiences of people who stammer in smart speaker design to increase their accessibility.",

As user-generated content in online videos grows in prevalence, researchers have explored using automatic speech recognition (ASR) to automate captioning. However, definitions of captions (as compared to subtitles) include non-speech sounds, which ASR typically does not capture as it focuses on speech. Thus, we explore DHH viewers' and hearing video creators' perspectives on captioning non-speech sounds in user-generated online videos using text or graphics. Formative interviews with 11 DHH participants informed the design and implementation of a prototype interface for authoring text-based and graphic captions using automatic sound event detection, which was then evaluated with 10 hearing video creators. Our findings include identifying DHH viewers' interests in having important non-speech sounds included in captions, as well as various criteria for sound selection and the appropriateness of text-based versus graphic captions of non-speech sounds. Our findings also include hearing creators' requirements for automatic tools to assist them in captioning non-speech sounds.",

Hasty adaptations make it unclear how to design these programs to capture the benefits of online delivery and face-to-face interactions. To understand the complexities of program delivery, we interviewed program coordinators and held focus groups with people living with dementia (PLWD) and their informal carers. We applied an interdependence framework to examine how the relationships between individuals affect program benefits. We found that interdependencies within an organization related to finances and networking are key and that organizational and individual interdependencies converge during program delivery. Our findings suggest these two interdependencies could influence one another more effectively if technology, like video conferencing, were designed to account for it. We discuss how an expanded notion of interdependency for the design of technology helps expand inclusivity in accessible social programs.",

Colour Identification (or CVD) Aids have been developed to assist people with CVD, however, the methods used to evaluate them are often limited and many use CVD simulations instead of participants with CVD. To address this, we propose two new CVD Aid evaluation tasks and show that they can assist in providing a more thorough evaluation of potential CVD aids. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of CVD simulations used by non-CVD people in providing results similar to those for people with CVD, and found that both the results and participant behaviour often differed. Our results indicate that greater care is needed when evaluating CVD Aids.",

Artistic practices have also helped to inspire, innovate and push the boundaries of HCI, giving rise to new technologies and interaction possibilities. Our paper presents the exploration of the experiences and practices of 17 artists who used wheelchairs for mobility. Through the thematic analysis of interviews, we conceptualize three themes: (1) Personal journeys through art and disability; (2) Social encounters through art, (3) Skills and technology in art making. From these themes, we reflect on how art can help HCI researchers to capture the complexity of the experiences of disability and assistive technology use and how collaboration with disabled artists could help to rethink the design of disruptive artistic technologies.

      "abstract": "User-generated content plays a key role in social networking, allowing a more active participation, socialisation, and collaboration among users. In particular, media content has been gaining a lot of ground, allowing users to express themselves through different types of formats such as images, GIFs and videos. The majority of this growing type of online visual content remains inaccessible to a part of the population, in particular for those who have a visual disability, despite available tools to mitigate this source of exclusion. We sought to understand how people are perceiving this type of online content in their networks and how support tools are being used. To do so, we conducted a user study, with 258 social network users through an online questionnaire, followed by interviews with 20 of them – 7 blind users and 13 sighted users. Results show how the different approaches being employed by major platforms may not be sufficient to address this issue properly. Our findings reveal that users are not always aware of the possibility and the benefits of adopting accessible practices. From the general perspectives of end-users experiencing accessible practices, concerning barriers encountered, and motivational factors, we also discuss further approaches to create more user engagement and awareness.",

      "abstract": "Social Virtual Reality (VR) is growing for remote socialization and collaboration. However, current social VR applications are not accessible to people with visual impairments (PVI) due to their focus on visual experiences. We aim to facilitate social VR accessibility by enhancing PVI's peripheral awareness of surrounding avatar dynamics. We designed VRBubble, an audio-based VR technique that provides surrounding avatar information based on social distances. Based on Hall’s proxemic theory, VRBubble divides the social space with three Bubbles---Intimate, Conversation, and Social Bubble---generating spatial audio feedback to distinguish avatars in different bubbles and provide suitable avatar information. For each level of space, we provide information of avatars that interact with the corresponding space (enter the space or leave) via spatial audio feedback. We provide three audio alternatives: earcons, verbal notifications, and real-world sound effects. PVI can select and combine their preferred feedback alternatives for different avatars, bubbles, and social contexts. We evaluated VRBubble and an audio beacon baseline with 12 PVI in a navigation and a conversation context. We found that VRBubble significantly enhanced participants' avatar awareness during navigation and enabled avatar identification in both contexts. However, VRBubble was shown to be more distracting in crowded environments.",

This prevents these users from participating in programming activities where these systems are used. This paper presents a prototype of an accessible block-based programming library called Accessible Blockly that allows users to write and navigate block-based code using a screen reader and a keyboard. This is an attempt to make the famous Blockly library accessible through a screen reader and keyboard. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Accessible Blockly. We also discuss the evaluation of the library for block-based code navigation in a study with 12 blind programmers. Analysis of the study results shows that Accessible Blockly effectively aids users with reading and understanding block-based code. Participants found Accessible Blockly easy to use and less frustrating for navigating block-based programs. The participants also expressed enthusiasm and interest in using the keyboard and screen reader to navigate block-based code and in the accessibility of block-based programming.",

We propose BentoMuseum, a layered, stackable, and three-dimensional museum map that makes complex structural information accessible by allowing explorations on a floor and between floors. Touchpoints are embedded to provide audio-tactile interactions that allow a user to learn the museum’s exhibits and navigation when one floor is placed on a touch screen. Using a tour design task, we invited 12 first-time blind visitors to explore the museum building, chose exhibits that attracted them, and built a mental map with exhibit names and directions. The results show that the system is useful in obtaining information that links geometric shapes, contents, and locations to then build a rough mental map. The connected floors and spatial structures motivated users to explore. Moreover, having a rough mental map enhanced orientation and confidence when traveling through the museum.",

We find that the capacity of author-written alt text to fulfill blind and low vision user needs is mixed; for example, only 50% of alt texts in our sample contain information about extrema or outliers, and only 31% contain information about major trends or comparisons conveyed by the graph. We release our collected dataset of author-written alt text, and outline possible ways that it can be used to develop tools and models to assist future authors in writing better alt text. Based on our findings, we also discuss recommendations that can be acted upon by publishers and authors to encourage inclusion of more types of semantic content in alt text.",

As digital banking platforms (e.g., mobile apps, electronic payment) gradually replace physical ones, it is critical to understand how they adapt to digital banking and the potential frictions they experience. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 older adults in China, where the aging population is the largest and digital banking grows fast. We also interviewed bank employees to gain complementary perspectives of these help givers. Our findings show that older adults used both physical and digital platforms as an ecosystem based on perceived pros and cons. Perceived usefulness, self-confidence, and social influence were key motivators for learning digital banking. They experienced app-related (e.g., insufficient error-recovery support) and user-related challenges (e.g., trust, security and privacy concerns, low perceived self-efficacy) and developed coping strategies. We discuss design considerations to improve their banking experiences.",

      "abstract": "Digital fabrication methods have been shown to be an effective method for producing customized assistive technology (AT). However, the skills required to utilize these tools currently require a high level of technical skill. Previous research showed that integration of these skills within physical therapy training is appropriate but that the level of technical difficulty required can be an issue. We worked to address these issues by introducing a group of PT students to maker concepts and having them develop custom AT for real end users with the help of makers. We present three considerations when integrating making into PT curriculum: 1) including all stakeholders, 2) developing interdisciplinary competencies for PTs and makers, and 3) leveraging academic training programs to connect makers and PT students. In this paper, we contribute to knowledge on how to facilitate the 3D printing of customized ATs for PT students by connecting them with a community organization that provides digital fabrication services and technical expertise. By connecting multiple stakeholders (i.e., PT students, digital fabricators, and AT users), we offer an approach to overcome time and capacity constraints of PT students to utilize advanced fabrication technologies to create customized ATs through connecting them to professional makers.",

However, while teachable interfaces enable blind users to train and test an object recognizer with photos taken in their distinctive environment, accessibility of training iteration and evaluation steps has received little attention. Iteration assumes visual inspection of the training photos, which is inaccessible for blind users. We explore this challenge through MyCam, a mobile app that incorporates automatically estimated descriptors for non-visual access to the photos in the users' training sets. We explore how blind participants (N=12) interact with MyCam and the descriptors through an evaluation study in their homes. We demonstrate that the real-time photo-level descriptors enabled blind users to reduce photos with cropped objects, and that participants could add more variations by iterating through and accessing the quality of their training sets. Also, Participants found the app simple to use indicating that they could effectively train it and that the descriptors were useful. However, subjective responses were not reflected in the performance of their models, partially due to little variation in training and cluttered backgrounds.",

      "abstract": "Prior work has explored the writing challenges experienced by people with dyslexia, and the potential for new spelling, grammar, and word retrieval technologies to address these challenges. However, the capabilities for natural language generation demonstrated by the latest class of large language models (LLMs) highlight an opportunity to explore new forms of human-AI writing support tools. In this paper, we introduce LaMPost, a prototype email-writing interface that explores the potential for LLMs to power writing support tools that address the varied needs of people with dyslexia. LaMPost draws from our understanding of these needs and introduces novel AI-powered features for email-writing, including: outlining main ideas, generating a subject line, suggesting changes, rewriting a selection. We evaluated LaMPost with 19 adults with dyslexia, identifying many promising routes for further exploration (including the popularity of the “rewrite” and “subject line” features), but also finding that the current generation of LLMs may not surpass the accuracy and quality thresholds required to meet the needs of writers with dyslexia. Surprisingly, we found that participants’ awareness of the AI had no effect on their perception of the system, nor on their feelings of autonomy, expression, and self-efficacy when writing emails. Our findings yield further insight into the benefits and drawbacks of using LLMs as writing support for adults with dyslexia and provide a foundation to build upon in future research.",

Using a 2-week diary study, we gauge whether the application’s customization options and features are sufficient to allow therapists and educational professionals to create AR experiences for the various learning activities they conduct with autistic children, and what challenges they face in this regard. We find that participants think the application would be suitable for creating AR experiences for a wide range of learning activities, such as choice-making and teaching daily living skills, and think that the application's freeze feature can be helpful when working with children with limited attention. Towards the end of the paper we discuss the challenges users face when trying to incorporate picture-based AR in practical therapy exercises, and how they can be addressed.",

      "abstract": "People with complex communication needs (CCNs) can use high-tech augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices and systems to compensate for communication difficulties. While many use AAC effectively, much research has highlighted challenges -- for instance, high rates of abandonment and solutions which are not appropriate for their end-users. Presently, we lack a detailed survey of this field to comprehend these shortcomings and understand how the accessibility community might direct its efforts to design more effective AAC.  In response to this, we conduct a systematic review and taxonomy of high-tech AAC devices and interventions, reporting results from 562 articles identified in the ACM DL and SCOPUS databases. We provide a taxonomical overview of the current state of AAC devices -- e.g. their  interaction modalities and characteristics. We describe the communities of focus explored, and the methodological approaches used. We contrast findings in the broader accessibility and HCI literature to delineate future avenues for exploration in light of the current taxonomy, offer a reassessment of the norms and incumbent research methodologies and present a discourse on the communities of focus for AAC and interventions.

      "abstract": "The usage of identity- (e.g., \"disabled people\") versus person-first language (e.g., \"people with disabilities\") to refer to disabled people has been an active and ongoing discussion. However, it remains unclear which semantic language should be used, especially for different disability categories within the overall demographics of disabled people. To gather and examine the language preferences of disabled people, we surveyed 519 disabled people from 23 countries. Our results show that 49% of disabled people preferred identity-first language whereas 33% preferred person-first language and 18% had no preference. Additionally, we explore the intra-sectionality and intersectionality of disability categories, gender identifications, age groups, and countries on language preferences, finding that language preferences vary within and across each of these factors. Our qualitative assessment of the survey responses shows that disabled people may have multiple or no preferences. To make our survey data publicly available, we created an interactive and accessible live web platform, enabling users to perform intersectional exploration of language preferences. In a secondary investigation, using part-of-speech (POS) tagging, we analyzed the abstracts of 11,536 publications at ACM ASSETS (N=1,564) and ACM CHI (N=9,972), assessing their adoption of identity- and person-first language. We present the results from our analysis and offer recommendations for authors and researchers in choosing the appropriate language to refer to disabled people.",

      "abstract": "The Deaf and Hard-of-hearing (DHH) community faces a lack of information in American Sign Language (ASL) and other signed languages. Most informational resources are text-based (e.g. books, encyclopedias, newspapers, magazines, etc.). Because DHH signers typically prefer ASL and are often less fluent in written English, text is often insufficient. At the same time, there is also a lack of large continuous sign language datasets from representative signers, which are essential to advancing sign langauge research and technology. In this work, we explore the possibility of crowdsourcing English-to-ASL translations to help address these barriers. To do this, we present a novel bilingual interface that enables the community to both contribute and consume translations. To shed light on the user experience with such an interface, we present a user study with 19 participants using the interface to both generate and consume content. To better understand the potential impact of the interface on translation quality, we also present a preliminary translation quality analysis. Our results suggest that DHH community members find real-world value in the interface, that the quality of translations is comparable to those created with state-of-the-art setups, and shed light on future research avenues.

      "abstract": "In the US people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) comprise one of the most likely groups to experience traumatic life events. These experiences often produce negative effects (e.g., stress, anxiety, grief, numbing, etc.) that need to be managed. Methods such as emotional self-regulation are often used to help people cope when these effects present themselves post-trauma. In recent years mobile-computing-devices-based apps have been increasingly used to help the general population with autonomous self-regulation. However, none of these are designed for people with I/DD or are cognizant of the trauma they experience in their lives. We interview eight (8) practitioners at a trauma services organization, which, among other things, helps people with I/DD learn and practice post-trauma self-regulation. The goal of the interviews is to understand what it would take to build post-trauma self-regulation apps for people with I/DD. Based on the interview responses we argue for a set of guidelines, based on the social work practice of trauma-informed care, to design post-trauma self-regulation apps for people with I/DD.",

      "abstract": "Commercial technologies for notating music pose usage barriers to blind and visually impaired (BVI) musicians because they use graphic user interfaces and only produce visual, print scores. However, more research to date has studied how to make existing scores available in braille or large print rather than understand the needs and workflows of BVI musicians who notate new music. To address this gap, we conducted a six-week remote study in which six BVI musicians with wide-ranging backgrounds wrote original music culminating in a live performance. To create their scores, participants used SoundCells, a product of ongoing co-design and testing with BVI musicians that uses text to generate audio, print, and braille music. Across three interviews, participants offered diverse and nuanced views of how text input could facilitate creative expression. We uncovered how vision ability, music experience, and assistive technology preference affected how music was accessed and traversed. From this research, we provide design recommendations for improving SoundCells' input and output systems, discuss how visual cues embedded in SoundCells' syntax make learning and remembering harder for people who can't view it, and reflect on how our chosen methods resulted in high engagement.",

      "abstract": "In social Virtual Reality (VR), users are embodied in avatars and interact with other users in a face-to-face manner using avatars as the medium. With the advent of social VR, people with disabilities (PWD) have shown an increasing presence on this new social media. With their unique disability identity, it is not clear how PWD perceive their avatars and whether and how they prefer to disclose their disability when presenting themselves in social VR. We fill this gap by exploring PWD's avatar perception and disability disclosure preferences in social VR. Our study involved two steps. We first conducted a systematic review of fifteen popular social VR applications to evaluate their avatar diversity and accessibility support. We then conducted an in-depth interview study with 19 participants who had different disabilities to understand their avatar experiences. Our research revealed a number of disability disclosure preferences and strategies adopted by PWD (e.g., reflect selective disabilities, present a capable self). We also identified several challenges faced by PWD during their avatar customization process. We discuss the design implications to promote avatar accessibility and diversity for future social VR platforms.",

Visually impaired players (VIPs), however, must often rely heavily on SATs to gain spatial awareness, especially in complex environments where using rich ambient sound design alone may be insufficient. Researchers have developed many SATs for facilitating spatial awareness within VIPs. Yet this abundance disguises a gap in our understanding about how exactly these approaches assist VIPs in gaining spatial awareness and what their relative merits and limitations are. To address this, we investigate four leading approaches to facilitating spatial awareness for VIPs within a 3D video game context. Our findings uncover new insights into SATs for VIPs within video games, including that VIPs value position and orientation information the most from an SAT; that none of the approaches we investigated convey position and orientation effectively; and that VIPs highly value the ability to customize SATs.",

      "abstract": "Accessible design and technology could support the large and growing group of people with chronic illnesses. However, human computer interactions (HCI) has largely approached people with chronic illnesses through a lens of medical tracking or treatment rather than accessibility. We describe and demonstrate a framework for designing technology in ways that center the chronically ill experience. First, we identify guiding tenets: 1) treating chronically ill people not as patients but as people with access needs and expertise, 2) recognizing the way that variable ability shapes accessibility considerations, and 3) adopting a theoretical understanding of chronic illness that attends to the body. We then illustrate these tenets through autoethnographic case studies of two chronically ill authors using technology. Finally, we discuss implications for technology design, including designing for consequence-based accessibility, considering how to engage care communities, and how HCI research can engage chronically ill participants in research.",

In response, work around AI fairness and inclusion has called for datasets that are representative of various demographic groups. In this paper, we contribute an analysis of the representativeness of age, gender, and race & ethnicity in accessibility datasets–datasets sourced from people with disabilities and older adults–that can potentially play an important role in mitigating bias for inclusive AI-infused applications. We examine the current state of representation within datasets sourced by people with disabilities by reviewing publicly-available information of 190 datasets, we call these accessibility datasets. We find that accessibility datasets represent diverse ages, but have gender and race representation gaps. Additionally, we investigate how the sensitive and complex nature of demographic variables makes classification difficult and inconsistent (e.g., gender, race & ethnicity), with the source of labeling often unknown. By reflecting on the current challenges and opportunities for representation of disabled data contributors, we hope our effort expands the space of possibility for greater inclusion of marginalized communities in AI-infused systems.",

However, it may be a challenge for deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH) VR users to access the information given by sounds, which could limit their VR experience. To address this limitation, we present \"SoundVizVR\", which explores visualizing sound characteristics and sound types for several types of sounds in VR experience. SoundVizVR uses Sound-Characteristic Indicators to visualize the loudness, duration, and location of sound sources in VR and Sound-Type Indicators to present more information about the type of sound. First, we examined three types of Sound-Characteristic Indicators (On-Object Indicators, Full Mini-Maps, and Partial Mini-Maps) and their combinations in a study with 11 DHH participants. We identified that the combination of Full Mini-Map technique and On-Object Indicator was the most preferred visualization and performed best at locating sound sources in VR. Next, we explored presenting more information about the sounds using text and icons as Sound-Type Indicators. A second study with 14 DHH participants found that all Sound-Type Indicator combinations were successful at locating sound sources.",

      "abstract": "When playing musical instruments, deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) people typically sense their music from the vibrations transmitted by the instruments or the movements of their bodies while performing. Sensory substitution devices now exist that convert sounds into light and vibrations to support DHH people’s musical activities. However, these devices require specialized hardware, and the marketing profiles assume that standard musical instruments are available. Hence, a significant gap remains between DHH people and their musical performance enjoyment. To address this issue, this study identifies end users’ preferred gestures when using smartphones to emulate the musical experience based on the instrument selected. This gesture elicitation study applies 10 instrument types. Herein, we present the results and a new taxonomy of musical instrument gestures. The findings will support the design of gesture-based instrument interfaces to enable DHH people to more directly enjoy their musical performances.",

Attempting to make people's daily habits in the kitchen area easier and more comfortable, we designed an innovative smart accessible cupboard that can identify various information about the products that are placed inside it, such as their type, quantity, location and expiration date. The Smart Kitchen Cupboard is a component of the Intelligent Kitchen aiming to support users in that space by indicating where to find a desired item, assisting in a context-sensitive manner during the cooking process and helping the overall inventory organization. Our immediate plans include planning a full-scale user evaluation in order to get useful feedback about the current design decisions so as to further improve the prototype and integrate more features.",

Yet, the use of technology in creative sound activities by people who are deaf, Deaf, and hard of hearing (DHH) has been underexplored by the research community. To address this gap, we conducted an online survey with 50 DHH participants to understand their use of technology and barriers they face in their creative sound activities. We find DHH people use four types of technology - hearing devices, sound manipulation, sound visualization, and speech-to-text - for three purposes - to improve sound perception via auditory and visual means, to avoid hearing fatigue, and to better communicate with hearing people. We also find their barriers to technology: unknown availability, limited options, and limitations that technology can solve. We discuss opportunities for more inclusive design specific to DHH people's creative sound activities, as well as facilitating access to information about technology.",

This is because they are highly dependent on the physical manipulation of a mouse or keyboard to drag and drop elements on the screen. Our research aims to make the block-based programming environment Blockly, accessible to users with upper limb motor impairments by adding voice as an alternative input modality. This voice-enabled version of Blockly will reduce the need for the use of a pointing device, thus increasing access for people with limited dexterity. The Voice-enabled Blockly system consists of the Blockly application, a speech recognition API, predefined voice commands, and a custom function. A usability study was conducted using a prototype of Voice-enabled Blockly. The results revealed that the system can be used by people with motor impairments. However, it also exposed some shortcomings of the tool and gave some suggestions on how to fix them. Based on the findings, changes will be made to the system, and then, it will be evaluated in another user study in the near future.",

As part of this, research projects and do-it-yourself assistive technology efforts have employed making in relation to accessibility. In order to better understand the relationship between people with disabilities and making, we conducted a systematic literature review focused on design-related ACM conferences between January 2010 and December 2020, identifying 74 full research papers. This paper presents our findings based on analysis and categorization of the literature to help characterize and understand trends and coverage in research on making and accessibility",

      "abstract": "Autonomous navigation on wheelchairs promises to be a significant frontier in the evolution of the power wheelchair as an assistive enabling device, and is increasingly explored among researchers for its potential to unlock more accessible navigation for wheelchair users. While developments on path-planning methods for wheelchairs is ongoing, there is a relative paucity of research on autonomous wheelchair navigation experiences which accommodate potential users' needs. In this work, we present preliminary design considerations for the user experience for autonomous wheelchair navigation derived from a semi-structured interview with ten (10) current wheelchair users about their willingness to use and applicability of an autonomous navigation function. From this, nine (9) expressed a willingness to use autonomous navigation in the near future in a range of contexts, while expressing attitudes like expectations, concerns, and motivations for intent to use. To better understand the impetus for such attitudes, we conducted thematic analysis to reveal three high-order factors and associated qualities which together serve as a framework to help understand participants' intent. Finally, we highlight three critical areas of focus to highlight opportunities and challenges for developers of a user-centered autonomous navigation experience for wheelchairs.",

Digital prototyping tools are a powerful resource for designers to quickly explore both low and high fidelity design mockups during initial stages of product design and development. We evaluated 10 popular prototyping tools to understand their built-in and third-party accessibility features. We found that accessible design support is largely from third-party plug-ins rather than prototyping tools' built-in features, and the availability of accessibility support varies from tool to tool. There is potential to improve accessible design by increasing the potential for accessibility to be consider earlier in the design process.",

In Hong Kong, it takes years for special education needs coordinators (SENCOs) and special-ed teachers to pre-screen and diagnose students with SLDs. Therefore, many students with SLDs missed the golden time for special interventions (i.e., before six years old). In addition, although there are screening tools for students with SLDs in Chinese and Indo-European languages (e.g., English and Spanish), they did not provide a student data visualization dashboard that could help teachers speed up the pre-screening process. Therefore, we co-designed a new visualization dashboard with Hong Kong SENCOs and special-ed teachers to assist them in pre-screening students with SLDs. Our formative study showed that our current design met teachers' need to quickly identify a student's specific under-performing tasks and effectively collect evidence about how the student was affected by SLDs. Future work will further test the efficacy of our design in real life. ",

Thus, we propose a modification of personas for DHH users by defining them in terms of ability ranges and driving or keeping factors within specific contexts. Starting with assumption personas based on previous research, we conducted focus groups with DHH individuals from which we derived the data and perspectives that formed our modification. With this approach, we want to promote an adequate representation of DHH users among designers while also demonstrating an application of Ability-Based Design to HCI methods. ",

The system emphasizes supporting parent autonomy by\r\nadapting ASL recommendations using parent’s speech during play, and minimizes obtrusion for face-to-face interaction through an Augmented Reality (AR) display. This paper describes the design and development of an initial working prototype of TIPs and preliminary results of the system’s efficiency regarding system latency and accuracy for ASL recommendation and visualization. Next, we plan to conduct a user study to gather expert and parent feedback about the system design and ASL recommendation strategies for long-term and personalized usage. ",

      "abstract": "Advancements in accessibility have led to mobile applications that help blind or low vision people (BLV) access surrounding information independently. Unfortunately, accessibility of visual information such as images remains limited. Previous research demonstrated that spatial interaction can help BLV users build a mental model of the relative locations of image objects. As haptics has recently become a core component of modern smartphones, we extend this prior research by designing three prototypes that use haptic feedback to reveal object location in images. \r\nWe evaluate these techniques in terms of experience and ability of BLV users to locate multiple objects in images. Evaluation results in a preliminary study with seven BLV users suggest that the proposed haptic feedback prototype with auditory notifications to identify people and auditory caption can provide a more accessible and engaging image experience.",

It helps patients achieve better training results by positively affecting motor control, the somatosensory system, and patient engagement.

In an expert study with nine therapists we evaluated Serenity, an audio-based rehabilitation game, as a design probe to explore the potential of audio-based games in rehabilitation training. Results show promise for further exploring the concept of audio-based gaming in stroke rehabilitation.",

Depending on the test setup, our classifer achieves accuracies between 82% and 100%. These fndings can be leveraged in future work to combine the classifer with algorithms tailored to each mobility aid to make activity trackers accessible to users with limited mobility.",

However, these aspects still hold important roles in how the user views and connects with their own limb. In order to better understand the impact that aesthetic design has on the individual, this exploratory case study aimed to create custom-designed prosthetic limb covers for lower limb amputees.

      "abstract": "Most students with specific learning disabilities (SLDs) have difficulties in reading and writing. The SLDs pre-screening is crucial because the golden period for therapy is before six years old. However, many students in Hong Kong receive SLDs assessments after the golden period. Also, the SLDs pre-screening is challenging, especially in a language with the logographic script but without prominent sound-script correspondence (e.g., Chinese, Japanese). To make pre-screening SLDs in Chinese more effective and efficient, we designed a new comprehensive pre-screening game for SLDs in Chinese (i.e., dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyspraxia). Notably, we designed a Chinese morphological awareness puzzle that challenges students to recognize different words made up with the first character that is identical and the second character that is different, such as 樹枝 (literally means tree branch), 樹幹 (literally means tree truck), 樹葉 (literally means tree leaves), and 樹根 (literally means tree root). We experimented with students, which showed that our game can effectively pre-screen students with SLDs in Chinese. Our work contributes an approach to quick SLDs in Chinese pre-screening, potentially useful for other logographic languages (e.g., Japanese).",

      "abstract": "Earcons are a critical auditory modality for those who perceive information best through sound. Yet earcons can trigger sensory sensitivities with neurodivergent individuals, causing pain or discomfort and creating barriers to information access. They must be carefully designed with neurodivergent representation in the design process to minimize the harm they impose. To address these challenges, we conduct a pilot study on Twitter, a social media platform with frequent earcons, to understand how to design sensory-sensitive earcons for neurodivergent individuals. We present the results of our qualitative interviews with nine neurodivergent Twitter users, uncovering six key themes for designing sensory-sensitive earcons. Based on our findings, we offer a set of novel guidelines for practitioners to design sensory-sensitive earcons for accessibility.",

While shapes may be simple to depict, objects often appear disjunctive when represented in graphics. Researchers have evaluated the efficacy of TG and stated factors like size, complexity, or prior visual experience, affect identification. However, the specific features of a graphic or aspects that enable object (3D) recognition through them need investigation. We evaluate the interactions of 12 PVI (8 born-blind and 4 late-blind), having minimal experience with TG or graphical representations, with 20 tactile stimuli including daily objects. We present graphic- and process-based factors that aid recognition. Our results indicate unique elements or a combination leading to recognition. Born-blind participants were able to identify stimuli based solely on their prior tactile experience of the actual objects, the majority being depictions of objects with insignificant thickness. Mirroring hand movements for symmetrical shapes were observed. A broader classification followed by deduction appeared as a common strategy of exploration. These insights impart improved understanding and evaluation of tactile graphics.",

In this paper, we demonstrate UnlockedMaps, an open-source and open-data web-based map that visualizes the real-time accessibility of urban rail transit stations in six North American cities, assisting users in making informed decisions regarding their commute. Specifically, UnlockedMaps uses a map to display transit stations, prominently highlighting their real-time accessibility status (accessible with functioning elevators, accessible but experiencing at least one elevator outage, or not-accessible) and surrounding accessible restaurants and restrooms. UnlockedMaps is the first system to collect elevator outage data from 2,336 transit stations over 23 months and make it publicly available via an API. We report on results from our pilot user studies with five stakeholder groups: (1) people with mobility disabilities; (2) pregnant people; (3) cyclists/stroller users/commuters with heavy equipment; (4) members of disability advocacy groups; and (5) civic hackers.

      "abstract": "Selfies are a pervasive form of communication in social media. While there has been some work on systems that guide people with visual impairments (PVI) in taking photos, nearly all has focused on using the camera on the back of the device. We do not know whether and how PVI take selfies. The aim of our work is to understand (1) PVI selfie-taking experiences and challenges, (2) what information do PVI need when taking selfies, and (3) what modalities do PVI prefer (e.g., tactile, verbal, or non-verbal audio) to support selfie-taking.  To address this gap, we conducted interviews with 10 PVI. Our findings show that current selfie-taking applications do not provide enough assistance to meet the needs of PVI. We contribute design guidelines that researchers and designers can implement for creating accessible selfie-taking applications.",

Five semi-structured interviews were conducted with 3 students and 2 campus counselors. Thus far, three primary themes (physical, social, and clinical factors), 8 secondary sub-themes, and 9 tertiary sub-themes are identified in influencing participants’ attitudes of counseling modalities including their initial attitudes toward adopting VR for remote counseling services. These insights suggest that VRT may be more openly adopted for improved access to campus counseling services and for specific clinical use cases where students can translate learned skills to the real world. Concerns of VRT include students using VR to support antithetical behavior and establishing trust between users in a VR environment.",

This paper describes a co-design process with a person living with DID. We first aimed to uncover the main challenges experienced by the co-designer as well as design opportunities for novel technologies. We then engaged in a prototyping stage to design a wearable display (WhoDID) to facilitate in-person social interactions. The prototype aims to be used as a necklace and enable the user to make their fronting personality visible to others. Thus, facilitating social encounters or sudden changes of identity. We reflect on the design features of WhoDID in the broader context of supporting people with DID. Moreover, we provide insights on co-designing with someone with multiple (sometimes conflicting) personalities regarding requirement elicitation, decision-making, prototyping, and ethics. To our knowledge, we report the first design process with a DID user within the ASSETS and CHI communities. We aim to encourage other assistive technology researchers to design with DID users.",

The gaming was implemented as a part of a neuropsychological group intervention for children with confirmed deficits in attention or diagnosed ADHD.

      "abstract": "People with motor disabilities of neuromuscular origin often struggle with operating the computer through a commercially available mouse and QWERTY keyboard. This work presents an alternative mouse and keyboard interface, which is personalizable to meet the individual needs of the target population to allow a more efficient use of the computer. The regular/commercially available mouse is therefor replaced by a spectacle frame equipped with pressure sensors for mouse click activation and an inertial measurement unit for mouse cursor control through head movements. The alternative keyboard is based around a ten button keyboard, with multiple letters assigned to each key. The users can then chose the desired word from a list of word suggestions that is compiled based on the keyboard input. Prior experiments, the users went through a software guided calibration procedure to experimentally determine individual thresholds and parameters. The system was tested by two nondisabled participants through typing and click tests, followed by a questionnaire to give feedback on the system.",

However, opportunities for in-person intergenerational social interactions are decreasing as families become increasingly geographically dispersed. Researchers are examining how technology might support these interactions. Extended Reality (XR) is an emerging technology that has shown potential for supporting immersive remote interactions but might cause an “experience asymmetry” in an intergenerational setting. In this poster we contrast the user experience of younger and older participants engaging in remote gardening sessions with our social XR prototypes. We present systemic influence factors that affected user experience of participants from different age groups differently with our XR prototypes. We discuss potential approaches to mitigate their effects based on observational learning and becoming aware of designer biases.",

In this poster, we (1) prototype and test AccessibleAD, an accessible AD writing system, (2) analyze what context and features are valued by BLV description writers, and (3) explore nonvisual involvement in AD creation.

In this paper, we propose SpineCurer(SC), an inertial measurement unit(IMU) based scoliosis training system. The system detects the patient’s posture in real time based on IMU, so that the patient can train without supervision. SC integrates two interaction games to assist training. We conducted a user study to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the system, which showed a positive effect in assisting scoliosis treatment.",

As accessibility is a key component of usable software, there are opportunities for software professionals to include accessibility in their skill set. However, despite a push to motivate more companies to include accessibility as a desired knowledge and skill set, little is known about how much companies are seeking to recruit employees with accessibility proficiency. In this paper, we investigated the extent to which companies seek software designer and developer skills in accessibility by analyzing software job posts on LinkedIn. Our results showed that the majority of job posts did not require any accessibility skills, and that educating developers and designers about accessibility was a required qualification for many of the accessibility-focused software jobs.",

      "abstract": "Sonification is a commonly used technique to make online data visualizations accessible to screen-reader users through auditory means. While current sonification solutions provide plausible utility (usefulness) to screen-reader users in exploring data visualizations, they are limited in exploring the quality (usability) of the sonified responses. In this preliminary exploration, we investigated the usability and user-friendliness of data visualization sonification for screen-reader users. Specifically, we evaluated the Pleasantness, Clarity, Confidence, and Overall Score of discrete and continuous sonified responses generated using various oscillator waveforms and synthesizers through user studies with 10 screen-reader users. Additionally, we examined these factors using both simple and complex trends. Our results show that screen-reader users preferred distinct non-continuous responses generated using oscillators with square waveforms. We utilized our findings to extend the functionality of Sonifier--an open-source JavaScript library that enables developers to sonify online data visualizations. Our follow-up interviews with screen-reader users identified the need to personalize the sonified responses per their individualized preferences.",

Recently, Mack et al. shed light on the demographics, goals, research methodologies, and evolution of accessibility research over time. We extend their work by exploring the frequencies and trends of disability categories and computer science research domains in publications at ASSETS (N=1,678). Our results show that disability categories and research domains varied significantly across the publication years. We found that in the past 10 years, publications targeting Mental-Health-Related disabilities and the research domain of AR/VR show an increasing trend. In opposition, Gaming, Input Methods/Interaction Techniques, and User Interfaces domains portray a decreasing trend. Additionally, our results show that the majority of the publications utilize the AI/ML/CV/NLP domain (19%) and focus on the people with visual disabilities (42%). We share our preliminary exploration results and identify avenues for future work.",

      "abstract": "Population aging is an increasingly important consideration for health care in the 21th century, and continuing to have access and interact with digital health information is a key challenge for aging populations. Voice-based Intelligent Virtual Assistants (IVAs) are promising to improve the Quality of Life (QoL) of older adults, and coupled with Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) they can be effective to collect important health information from older adults, especially when it comes to repeated time-based events. However, this same EMA data is hard to access for the older adult: although the newest IVAs are equipped with a display, the effectiveness of visualizing time--series based EMA data on standalone IVAs has not been explored. To investigate the potential opportunities for visualizing time--series based EMA data on standalone IVAs, we designed a prototype system, where older adults are able to query and examine the time--series EMA data on Amazon Echo Show --- a widely used commercially available standalone screen--based IVA. We conducted a preliminary semi--structured interview with a geriatrician and an older adult, and identified three findings that should be carefully considered when designing such visualizations.",

      "abstract": "Assistive technologies (AT) are a necessity for a person with a severe disability to be able to lead a self-determined life within modern societies. Thus, these technologies fulfil an important societal role and have a significant impact on the lives of those affected. This experience report provides insights on the lived experiences surrounding the necessary use of AT from the point of view of a disabled person.  Using an autoethnographic approach, we determine the function and relevance of AT in everyday life and illustrate the intended and unintended effects of AT as well as the subsequently arising socio-technical dependencies through representative examples. The results show how the resulting dependencies on AT pose a risk for users, especially in the event of a technological failure. Furthermore, a deployment of AT without the necessary reflection and preparation of backup strategies in case of failure may lead to unexpected and inadvertent, potentially harmful, side-effects. Based on these observations, we elaborate on the implications for different stakeholder groups involved with the design, development, deployment and daily use of AT.  We deem the  key factors for success to lie in a deeper understanding of the application context, the integration of affected people in the development process as well as a fundamentally reflective approach by everyone involved with AT.",

This design inquiry looks at the use of a Cricut cutting machine to layer cardstock for creating tangible pictures and coloring pages. This report discusses the development of the technique followed by the corresponding production considerations, design iterations, pilot feedback, and limitations. We believe that in certain contexts this technique could be a viable method for conveying tactile information, especially in the context of early learning activities where practice is required for gaining life-long tactile graphicacy skills that can translate to reading maps and information graphics later in life. Additionally, the low acquisition cost of this method has value to parents and educators of blind and low vision children as a cheap DIY way to make tactile content.",

Prior work shows how these services enable people with vision impairments to travel independently without the use of public transportation or walking. We conducted a study in which we observed 17 blind or visually impaired participants using the Uber ridesharing service to explore the social and accessibility dynamics they perceived during their experiences. This paper presents a case study of the process used for our research, reflecting on aspects that considerably impacted the study. Key takeaways include study site considerations, recruiting participants, balancing realism with participant safety, and the unintended side effects of observations in a ridesharing context. The reflection points provided will help readers in considering important study aspects when conducting observations with participants with disabilities, particularly in a ridesharing setting.",

Now companies like GM and Google are developing and testing fully autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the current design of AVs is for individuals who can drive rather than those who cannot, those who would benefit most from these vehicles. As the technology is still primarily experimental, conducting research with AVs and older adults or people with disabilities is infeasible. Therefore, to explore the accessibility of AVs, we conduct user enactment studies, as this method works well with technologies that participants have little to no experience utilizing. This pictorial describes the iterative process of developing a high-fidelity enactment environment, the space and objects with which participants interact. The aim is to encourage the HCI community to utilize high-fidelity enactment environments for conducting accessible future technology research.",

      "abstract": "Over the last 2 decades, the way in which disabled body minds are regarded in research has evolved considerably. From an understanding that disability research involves research or enquiry on or of disabled people, there is now a shift in thinking that regards disability research as research done by and with disabled people as well, thus challenging traditional researcher-participant relationships. This has lead to a larger number of people with disabilities aspiring to enter academia. However, several barriers to full inclusion of people with disabilities still remain. This paper talks about one such barrier, that is, the lack of accessibility in software packages used for qualitative data analysis.  Through the author’s experiences in hunting for accessible ways to perform qualitative data analysis, the paper reviews existing software packages, discusses possible workarounds, and considers the feature requirements for an accessible qualitative data analysis tool.",

This is particularly amplified in the context of disabilities even if the researchers identify themselves as disabled given that the interaction is governed by social status and material power dimensions to say the least. To work productively with these power dynamics, we explored embodied approaches to articulating critique acknowledging the different ways of knowing stemming from different bodyminds. Here, we line out two exploratory cases illustrating how physical bodies can be directly attended to to express critiques in more direct ways than participants might be used to on a language based level (spoken or signed).  We show how communication and critique can take on many forms encouraging us to broaden our methodological toolset to incorporate practices common in disability cultures.  Our experiences show that we need to embrace crip approaches to knowledge production to receive more actionable and useful feedback in developing technologies with disabled communities. ",
