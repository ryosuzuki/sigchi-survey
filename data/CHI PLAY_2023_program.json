      "abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) games and experiences predominantly have the users interact while standing or seated. However, this only represents a fraction of the full diversity of human movement. In this paper, we explore a novel non-standing approach to VR locomotion where the user performs locomotion movements in the air or only slightly touching the ground with their feet. For instance, the user may lie supine on the ground, reminiscent of the Bicycle Crunch, a core training movement common in Pilates and other forms of bodyweight exercise. Although this cannot generally replace traditional VR locomotion, it provides two benefits that we believe can be of use for specific application domains such as VR exergames: First, the user's lower body movement is not impeded by a small real-life space, allowing versatile navigation of large virtual worlds using walking, running, strafing, and jumping. Second, we allow new ways to activate parts of the body that remain passive in most existing VR interactions. We describe and discuss four different variants of the approach, and investigate two prototypes further in a qualitative user study, to better understand their strengths, weaknesses, and application potential.",

      "abstract": "Flow and self-determination theory predict that game difficulty in balance with player skill maximises enjoyment and engagement, mediated by attentive absorption or competence. Yet recent evidence and methodological concerns are challenging this view, and key theoretical predictions have remained untested, importantly which objective difficulty-skill ratio is perceived as most balanced. To test these, we ran a preregistered study (n=309) using a Go-like 2-player game with an AI opponent, randomly assigning players to one of three objective difficulty-skill ratios (AI plays to win, draw, or lose) over five matches. The AI successfully manipulated objective balance, with the draw condition perceived as most balanced. However, balance did not impact play behaviour, nor did we find the predicted uniform ‘inverted-U’ between balance and positive play experiences. Importantly, we found both theories too underspecified to severely test. We conclude that balance and competence likely matter less for behavioural engagement than commonly held. We propose alternative factors such as player appraisals, novelty, and progress, and debate the value and challenges of theory-testing work in games HCI.",

      "abstract": "Toxicity in multiplayer gaming is an ongoing problem that threatens the well-being of players, gaming communities, and game developers. Meanwhile, interventions that promote positive interactions and proactively create positive gaming spaces are still in their infancy; little is known about how players respond to positivity.\r\nIn our study, 959 League of Legends players were presented with either 10 positive chat logs or 10 negative chat logs, and asked to reflect on the content and how representative such communication is of their own gaming experiences. We thematically coded participants' free-form answers (identifying the themes normalize, acknowledge, downplay, cope, blame, and make personal), and compared the positive and negative conditions in terms of theme prevalence. Our findings show that participants were more likely to normalize and acknowledge toxic negativity than positivity. Furthermore, the dominant response to positivity consisted of downplaying messages as not representative and rare, and even expressing suspicion that messages must have been fabricated or intended as sarcasm. Participants overwhelmingly cope by muting chat, protecting them from toxic interactions, but leaving them unexposed to positive communication and other beneficial social interactions within play.",

What motivates a particular form of in-game communication and its impact, especially promptly after a communication attempt, on team performance is less explored.  In this paper, we present a framework for studying individual communication attempts using a gestured-based tool, \"Ping\", in a popular MOBA game, Heroes of the Storm. We design a framework to capture the game's situational context prior to the communication, the communication attempt, and its immediate impact. Using this framework, we analyze and identify game factors that influence players' decisions to communicate and their choice of communication. We also present how communication has an immediate positive effect on the team's performance. Our findings further the discussion of studying communication behaviors for virtual teams engaging in synchronous, collaborative work with shared visual spaces. ",

      "abstract": "In recent decades, several studies have suggested and validated user models (e.g., Bartle, and Hexad) to represent different user profiles in games and gamified environments. However, when applying these user models in practice (e.g., to personalize gamification), several studies reported contradictory outcomes. Recently, some studies outlined that one of the possible explanations for these contradictory findings is that people can present changes in their user profiles over time. In this study (N = 118), we present an analysis of the consistency of gamification user orientations after six months of the initial identification, by analyzing the association between user orientations in the first and second data collection. Overall, our results corroborate prior research demonstrating that user orientations can not be considered stable over time and also that the strongest tendency of the users might not be sufficient to determine how users change. Furthermore, we were able to identify that some user orientations can be more stable than others and model some relationships between their profiles after six months. Based on the results, we indicate a research agenda that can further the knowledge about the topic, as well as indicate a set of suggestions on how to model user profiles based on our results.",

In order to explore what dynamics in these games incentivize travel to specific places or areas, we engaged in interviews with active players. We discovered 11 unique game dynamics, which could be positioned under three overarching themes: (1) the playing field, as determined by the placement of points of interest, the players' habitat and their surroundings; (2) the player communities and real life relationships, which motivated and directed the playing; and (3) coincidental motivational support, which highlighted how location-based games offer multi-layered motivation for players to travel to, and engage with, specific real-world locations. Our study contributes to the fields of gamified human mobility and human-nature interaction by elucidating how playful technologies can influence where and when people move.",

      "abstract": "Heuristics present a cheap and effective way of evaluating usability. However, in video games, evaluating unique player experiences that are dependent on individual preferences and abilities presents a challenge that goes beyond usability. Video games are more than just functional software, so games heuristics have been adapted to help examine functionality and experience. This paper reports on how papers published in the ACM Digital Library between 2012 and 2022 develop and apply heuristics in video games research. We found that heuristics are often used outside their intended purpose of evaluation. Instead, they are used as survey instruments, interview guides, codes for thematic analysis, and as design guidelines. This research contributes to HCI and video games research by distinguishing the terms design guidelines and design principles from heuristics. We make recommendations for researchers around developing heuristics and conducting video game heuristic evaluations. We propose a method for operationalising heuristics and make recommendations for the implementation of heuristics to improve the quality of video game heuristic reviews. ",

      "abstract": "In Virtual Reality (VR), natural 3D interactions are performed with hand representations - the visualizations and interactors used for manipulating objects. Hand representations in VR games range from abstract shapes, to graphical versions of input controllers, to realistic human-like hands. Hand representations have been shown to have an important effect on play experience and performance. However, previous work has only considered them for individual 3D interactions or an entire game, giving designers little information about how a representation might perform and be experienced across different 3D interactions (like picking up and rotating objects, or opening a container). In this work, we compare three hand representations across 12 different 3D interactions and in a longer game experience in a study of 45 participants. We find that while representation did not affect performance, representations were overall experienced differently across 3D interactions. Our work provides a deeper understanding for VR game designers about how hand representations can be used to shape play experiences.",

      "abstract": "Modeling users' experience in gameful systems is one of the main contemporary challenges in the field of human-computer interaction. One of the most desired and complex experiences to be identified is the flow experience (i.e., challenge-skill balance, action-awareness merging, clear goals, unambiguous feedback, concentration, sense of control, loss of self-consciousness, transformation of time, and autotelic experience). Facing this challenge, we conducted a quantitative study (N = 313) based on structural equation modeling, aiming to model and predict the users' flow experience through their behavior (represented by performance-related, interaction with gamification, as well as the time they take in different actions) in the system. The main results indicate that i) gamification (i.e., doing well in points, badges, and leader-board) was positively related to users' experience of good challenge-skill balance, ii) whereas it was negatively related to users' concentration. Thirdly iii) user performance was positively related to users' concentration. However, overall, the results indicate that while associations between user behavior and flow experience could be established, there remains future work to be done to fully explain user flow experience while using a system. Our study contributes to the fields of human-computer interaction, gamification, and educational technologies, especially through insights related to modeling and predicting flow experiences in gameful systems through behavior data.",

In virtual reality (VR), various approaches, such as avatars, are developed for multi-player games to increase social connectedness. However, these approaches are lacking in single-player games.\r\nTo increase social connectedness in such games, our work explores the visualization of physiological data from asynchronous players, i.e., electrocardiogram (ECG). We identified two visualization dimensions, the number of players, and the visualization style, after a design workshop with experts (N=4) and explored them in a single-user virtual escape room game. We spatially and temporally integrated the visualizations and compared two times two visualizations against a baseline condition without visualization in a within-subject lab study (N=34). All but one visualization significantly increased participants’ feelings of social connectedness. Heart icons triggered the strongest feeling of connectedness, understanding, and perceived support in playing the game.",

      "abstract": "People with color vision deficiency (CVD) often encounter color-related challenges in their daily life, which are difficult for those with non-CVD to comprehend fully. Therefore, we designed a Virtual Reality (VR) serious game, BlueVR, to simulate challenging scenarios encountered by people with CVD and facilitate understanding from people with non-CVD. We conducted an empirical study with thirty participants with non-CVD and six participants with CVD to evaluate the opportunities and challenges of BlueVR. Our findings suggest that BlueVR increased people with non-CVD’s understanding, awareness, and perspective-taking abilities towards people with CVD. Moreover, interviews with participants with CVD revealed that BlueVR accurately depicts their real-life discomforts and meets their expectations to improve potential social awareness. This research contributes valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of VR serious games in promoting understanding and design implications for future game development.",

      "abstract": "Developing skill and overcoming in-game challenges is of great interest to both players and game designers. Players can improve through repetition, but sometimes practice does not lead to improvement and progress stalls. It would be useful if designers could help players make progress without compromising their long-term skill development. We carried out a study to investigate how two techniques—checkpoints and breaks—affect in-game progress and player skill. Checkpoints allow multiple attempts at a challenge without having to repeat earlier sections; this aids progress, but could potentially hinder skill development. Second, breaks in gameplay have been shown to accelerate skill development, but their effectiveness is unknown when the breaks are integrated into the game's design. Our study evaluated the effects of game-integrated breaks and checkpoints on players' in-game progress (when the techniques were present) as well as two test sessions (with all techniques removed). Our results showed that both checkpoints and breaks aid progress (combining both had the largest effect) and that neither technique reduced performance in the transfer task, suggesting that skill development was not hindered. Our work provides evidence that checkpoints and breaks are valuable techniques that can assist both player progress and skill.",

      "abstract": "The narrative experience of perennial games---ongoing, live games---revolves around the community that plays it. These games serve a fractured form of storytelling, which leaves it to the community to determine what counts as part of the story; or what is considered “canon”. What is canon is a question of who and what the story is allowed to be about, and what is allowed to be in it. Therefore, it is important to understand how players of perennial games understand what is canon and what is not.\r\nThis paper presents a mixed methods study of an online survey (N=118) and interviews (N=15) of players of the game Destiny 2, with the goal of understanding what events players consider canon and why.\r\nThe findings indicate that while authorship and conventional game story elements are considered canon, there is still disagreement, especially as the storytelling methods become non-conventional. Players can provide nuanced viewpoints on why an event is or is not canon, and they do not always agree. These results can help designers understand how their decisions influence the community discussions of canonicity, and how properties of their game can help create experiences that lets players see themselves in the work.",

      "abstract": "In 2018, Belgium made the world news for being the first country to ban loot boxes in games for all its inhabitants. As players’ freedom to purchase loot boxes was restricted, however, methods of circumventing the ban came into practice. Departing from counterplay theory, we drew from an online survey among Belgian adolescents aged 11-18 with two questions in mind: what counterplay practices are used to circumvent the Belgian ban on loot boxes, and how do counterplayers (N = 124) compare to non-counterplayers (N = 329) in terms of their engagement with loot boxes and games more broadly? Our findings suggest that counterplayers resist current regulatory arrangements in a myriad of ways, delineating the boundaries of a national ban in a global game ecology. Counterplayers appeared to differentiate themselves from non-counterplayers both in terms of depth-characteristics (sense of belonging to an online community, perceived gaming ability, gaming disorder, and risky loot box use) and breadth-characteristics (frequency of skin betting, selling loot box rewards, and (re)watching loot box opening livestreams). Ultimately, our study may tease out debate on how to regulate games successfully in the face of players’ technical abilities and motivation to  gain access.",

      "abstract": "In first-person shooter (FPS) games, players often need to calculate the timing of their shots for moving targets in advance based on the speed and relative position of those targets. For most players, the accurate timing of shots requires extended gaming experience and training. Unlike professional players, hobby players have less time to compete and train, do not receive professional game guidance, and cannot afford expensive gaming devices. According to previous studies, wearable devices with electrical stimulation can effectively control the muscles with rapid reactions. Here, we provide a method for training the timing of gaming shooters using electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). We believe that training with EMS is feasible and effective, allowing players to quickly learn and improve their gaming experience. To test the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, we first tested the player's reaction time when using the EMS device to ensure that it did not have a negative impact on the player. Participants were then trained in a custom FPS game with three methods: EMS, non-EMS and EMS-only. The results showed a more significant increase in the average hit rate of EMS-trained participants compared to those trained using the other two methods. Thus, our study shows the possibility of using EMS devices as a training medium for a custom FPS game.",

      "abstract": "Toxic behavior remains a salient challenge for online gaming environments, such as multiplayer online battle arena video games (MOBAs). In this study, we sought to understand player roles and settings in which toxicity occurs using a mixed-methods approach. First, we conducted ethnographic observations and interviews with players of the most popular contemporary MOBA, League of Legends (Study 1). During the qualitative analysis three main themes emerged: (1) the fluidity of roles, (2) the subjectivity of the toxic experience, and (3) cascading effects and changing modalities of toxicity. Based on the themes, we formulated hypotheses regarding players’ experience with toxicity. To test these hypotheses, we gathered cross-sectional data from MOBA players (n = 216), which we analyzed with co-variance-based statistics (Study 2). Our quantitative findings showcase the complexity of toxicity as well as players’ ambivalence toward the topic. We found indicators of substantial influences of personality and a cycle of retaliation.",

      "abstract": "Video games have become an important aspect of modern culture, especially with the widespread use of mobile devices. Thus, it is important that video games are accessible to all people, but colorblind players are still affected by the use of colors in game interfaces. Some challenges of developing chromatically accessible games are the limited availability of colorblind test subjects and the importance of identifying and considering accessibility threats even in the early stages of development. Thus, digital simulations emerge as possible tools to increase accessibility and awareness. In this paper, we conducted three empirical studies that seek to verify the relationship between the identification of color accessibility problems by people with typical color vision using simulations and people with color blindness, in the context of mobile games. Results indicate concrete uses in which color blindness simulations give advantages to developers with typical vision in identifying chromatic accessibility issues in their games. Additionally, we discuss different possibilities for incorporating simulation tools, accessibility guidelines, and colorblind user participation into a realistic game design life cycle. We also discuss how the incorporation of simulation tools could be beneficial to foment the discussion of accessibility in game design studios.",

      "abstract": "The Dualistic Model of Passion (obsessive and harmonious passion) can explain motivations for videogame play along with associated outcomes, such as the development of social capital; however, existing research exploring passion and social capital in videogaming has been cross-sectional. In the current study we surveyed players of DotA 2 at three time points, over six months (T1 n=462, T2 n=182, T3 n=115), to explore the stability of passion for DotA 2 over time and how such passion may lead to the development or erosion of social capital. Our key findings include that passion for playing DotA 2 is relatively stable over time and that harmonious passion predicts future bridging social capital, while obsessive passion predicts future bonding social capital. Importantly, our findings suggest the absence of a \"slippery slope\" scenario in which players who have a healthy pattern of engagement development obsessive passion or problematic play. Equally, however, our findings also suggest that those who are obsessive are unlikely to naturally trend towards a more harmonious style of engagement over time. We consider the implications of our findings for health practitioners, players and videogame developers and identify the differences between our longitudinal findings and the existing cross-sectional research.

      "abstract": "Understanding the experiences of players with disabilities is a key research issue in game accessibility. However, less is known about the values that young players experience from games, particularly in relation to their situational context as adolescents and young adults with disabilities. We explore how the values of accessible gaming are created in players’ lives by analyzing interviews with five players with cerebral palsy (CP) (age range 13–25 years) and their parents through the lens of developmental tasks theory. Using thematic analysis, we discovered three themes that illustrated how video games’ roles changed according to their life stages: “Establishing Healthy Self in Family”, “Navigating Peer Culture”, and “Preparing Adult Life”. Our results indicated that young players with CP made active decisions in their life and developed supportive relationships from playing accessible games. The changes in their desired developmental task and social contexts influenced the values they found in games. We discuss video games as a sociocultural resource that assists young players with CP to attain the developmental tasks they desire and achieve social inclusion. We conclude with design insights for creating more inclusive gameplay experiences for young players with CP.",

      "abstract": "Motivation and high effort in exergames are still open to optimization. In reality, coaches can stimulate athletes' engagement by infecting them with their emotions. However, whether these emotion-influencing effects also occur with virtual coaches remains unclear. In the present study, we measured the emotional state, motivation, and performance (punch speed) of 47 participants playing a VR exergame with an emotional (happy/angry) or neutral virtual coach. Results show that the happy and angry coach significantly affected the players' emotions. Furthermore, interacting with the emotional coaches leads to higher motivation, whereas the angry coach causes a reduction of feeling related.\r\nAlso, we found a significant positive correlation between the increase in anger and punch speed. Our results show that adding an emotional component to virtual coaches into exergames is promising for increasing motivation and performance. This study highlights the positive effects of emotional virtual characters for improving VR exergames and, therefore, players' health.",

      "abstract": "With the rise of free-to-play (F2P) games, the profitability of video-gaming apps critically depends on the\r\nability of developers to acquire, retain, and monetize large numbers of players. In this context, most game\r\ndesigners have no viable alternative than massively collecting players’ personal data and monitoring their\r\nbehavior to target them with personalized advertising and in-game purchases. Given the risks associated with\r\nsuch data practices, players, in particular children, need to be aware that a video game might compromise\r\ntheir privacy. Game designers should therefore ensure that players receive appropriate information about the\r\ndata practices associated with their games. This might, however, be challenging, especially when the game is\r\ndirected at children, given the complexity of privacy information and the limited literacy capacities of children\r\nand their parents. To answer game designers’ need for comprehensive guidance regarding the communication\r\nof privacy information to children, we provide a survey of the age-appropriate information design strategies\r\nwhich been recommended by data protection authorities, children protection organizations and the relevant\r\nscientific literature. On this occasion, we also refer to illustrative examples of designs which can be considered\r\ngood practices. Finally, by using an “evaluation matrix”, we reviewed and assessed the implementation of\r\nthose design strategies in nine F2P mobile games committed to following Google Play’s Families Policies. Our\r\nfindings show that, despite being child-oriented, the reviewed games largely fail at communicating privacy\r\ninformation in an age-appropriate way.",

      "abstract": "Deceptive design practices have been identified and studied in games but, to date, there have been no substantial explorations of deceptive design practices within 3D environments typically found in PC games. These offer a new set of affordances for interacting with the player, and game developers may be able to utilize these in order to shape gameplay experiences. The goal of this work was to explore users’ perceptions of deceptive design present in a popular free-to-play 3D game. A survey was carried out with 259 adult respondents identifying and explaining instances of deceptive design within video clips of gameplay from a popular Roblox game. Thematic analysis of the responses revealed six new categories of deceptive design pattern within a 3D gameplay context: Predatory Monetization, Default to Purchase, UI Misdirection, Emotional Interpersonal Persuasion, Physical Placement, and Narrative Obligation. Through our work we hope to highlight the use of deceptive design both within current 3D games and futue 3D gaming environments. This work is particularly important as 3D and VR gaming grow in popularity alongside game publishers increasingly moving towards “freemium’‘ monetization models for income.",

      "abstract": "Tile-based locomotion (TBL) is a popular locomotion technique for computer, console, and board games. However, despite its simplicity and unconventional movement, the transfer of TBL to virtual reality (VR) as a game platform remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce TBL for VR on the example of two techniques: a controller and a feet-based one. In a first user study, we evaluated the usability and acceptance of the techniques compared to teleportation and touchpad locomotion. In a second exploratory user study, we evaluated the user experience of both TBL techniques in a maze and a museum scenario. The findings show that both techniques provide enjoyment and acceptable usability by creating either a relaxing (controller-based) or a physically active (feet-based) solution. Finally, our results highlight that TBL techniques work particularly well for small, constrained spaces that allow users to focus on exploring details in the nearby environment (important for games) in contrast to large open spaces that require faster locomotion, like teleportation.",

      "abstract": " Gamification has been widely used to increase learners’ motivation and engagement in digital learning environments. Various studies have highlighted the need to tailor gamification according to users' characteristics. However, little is known about how tailoring gamification affects learners' engagement when interacting with the environment. In this paper, we analyse learners' behaviours in a large-scale field study in real-world classroom conditions over a six-week period. We identify three behavioural patterns and show at a global level that two of these patterns are influenced by adaptation. When we look at how learners' engagement evolves over time, we see more differences in the adapted condition, specifically in the final lessons of the experiment. Globally learners’ engaged behaviours gradually decreased over time but tailoring the game elements to learners seemed to reduce this decrease or make it more stable, depending on the behavioural patterns.

      "abstract": "Empowering people through technology is a core concern of HCI, yet little is known about how players experience empowerment or disempowerment through videogames. We surveyed 250 participants about their dis-/empowering videogame experiences, investigating why they felt dis-/empowered, and how these experiences related to core player experience constructs including emotion and basic needs satisfaction. While empowering experiences were often positive, and disempowering experiences often negative, we found meaningful exceptions to this, and a surprising complexity in player accounts. We capture this diversity in seven themes. These range from ``heroic victories´´ which follow long periods of failure, to positive experiences of disempowerment, which were appreciated for their narrative meaning. By articulating these complex experiences, and relating them to quantitative measures we provide a foundation for understanding of the role of dis-/empowerment in player experience, and highlight avenues for future work.

Among various live streaming channels, Danmaku participation game (DPG) has emerged in China as a mixture of live streaming and online gaming, offering an immersive gaming experience to players. Although prior research has explored audience participation games (APGs) in North America and Europe, it primarily focuses on discussing prototypes and lacks observation of players in natural settings. Little is known about how players perceive DPGs and their player experience. To fill the research gap, we observed a series of DPG channels and conducted an interview-based study to gain insights into the practices and experiences of DPG players. Our work reveals that DPGs can effectively synergize live streaming and online games, amplifying both player engagement and a profound sense of accomplishment to players.",

      "abstract": "Players increasingly adopt a data-driven approach to review and improve their gaming skills. In the wake of this, spatio-temporal visualizations gained popularity but remain challenging to design. Storyline visualizations are unique in the way they integrate time and location information into a single view to show how entity relationships develop over time. We adopt the storyline visualization technique to summarize gameplay for the purpose of post-play review. We demonstrate the method by applying it to League of Legends matches and evaluated it with 39 players of the game in a task-based online study using the triad framework for spatio-temporal queries by Peuquet. Results indicate that players responded positively to the approach and could, by and large, solve tasks well but that time-based tasks proved most challenging and least efficient to solve. Based on our findings, we reflect on possibilities for enhancing the design of storyline visualizations for game-related data analysis.",

      "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) games intensify storytelling experiences by letting players take the role of a character. However, in contrast to films, novels, or games, VR experiences often remain centered around one single character without using the potential of complex multiprotagonist plots. Our work engages in this critical topic by investigating the design of immersive and natural transitions between different characters. First, we conducted a scoping review to identify existing multiprotagonist VR games (N=18) and grouped their used transition techniques into four categories. Based on these findings and prior research, we designed two transition techniques (Static Map vs. Rebodying) and conducted a between-participants (N=36) study to explore their effect on user experience. Our results show that Rebodying outperforms Static Map regarding the perceived realism, acceptance, and spatial understanding of the character transitions. Both conditions do not differ significantly in terms of cybersickness. Finally, we provide future directions for developing, improving, and exploring of multiprotagonist transition techniques in VR games.",

      "abstract": "Psychological need frustration---experiences like failure, loneliness, or coercion---is emerging as a promising explanation for why people disengage with games and other entertainment media, and how media may induce dysregulated use and ill-being. However, existing research on game-related need frustration relies on general instruments with unclear content validity for games. We also do not know how need frustration arises in video games, nor how it leads to disengagement. We therefore conducted a semi-structured interview study with 12 video game players, following grounded theory methods to develop a model of need-frustrating play. We find that need frustration is a common and impactful experience in games, with distinct antecedents not fully captured in existing measures. Felt need frustration arises when observed need-frustrating events negatively violate expected need frustration or satisfaction; repeated violations update players' expectations, which lead them to modulate or quit play to reduce expected frustration exposure.",

      "abstract": "In interactive systems high latency affects user performance and experience. \r\nThis is especially problematic in video games.\r\nA large number of studies on this topic investigated the effects of constant, high latency.\r\nHowever, in practice, latency is never constant but varies by up to 100 ms due to variations in processing time and delays added by polling between system components.\r\nIn a large majority of studies, these variations in latency are neither controlled for nor reported. Thus, it is unclear to which degree small, continuous variations in latency affect user performance. If these unreported variations had a significant impact, this might cast into doubt the findings of some studies. \r\nTo investigate how latency variation affects player performance and experience in games, we conducted an experiment with 28 participants playing a first-person shooter. \r\nParticipants played with two levels of base latency (50 ms vs. 150 ms) and variation (0 ms vs. 50 ms). \r\nAs expected, high base latency significantly reduces player performance and experience.\r\nHowever, we found strong evidence that small variations in latency in the order of +/- 50 ms, do not affect player performance significantly. \r\nThus, our findings mitigate concerns that previous latency studies might have systematically ignored a confounding effect.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present an elicitation study which explores how people use common household objects as props to control virtual objects in augmented reality first-person perspective games. 24 participants were asked to select items from a range of common household objects to use as controllers for three different types of virtual object: a sword, shield, and crossbow. Participants completed short gameplay tasks using their selected items and rated the AR experience using the Augmented Reality Immersion (ARI) questionnaire. Results found no strong consensus linking any specific household object to any virtual object across our test group and, in addition, those who chose the most commonly selected object for each task did not have significantly higher scores on the ARI questionnaire compared to those who did not. A short post-experiment interview indicated a few key factors that were important to participants when selecting their household object, such as shape, size, grip feel and weight distribution. Based on our findings we recommend that developers provide the ability for users to choose which household objects to use as props based on the user's own preferences, and that they design intuitive ways for users to interact with virtual objects.",

      "abstract": "In 2020–2021, under the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, boardgame players around the world sought out ways to play physical boardgames with each other despite being physically apart. Their creative appropriations of digital technologies and physical tools to allow for hybrid distanced play demonstrate not only the resilience of boardgaming as a hobby, but also provide important insights into the design of novel distanced hybrid digital boardgames (DHDBs). Through a survey of over 1300 respondents, this paper explores the ways distanced players engaged in homebrew practices to make physical boardgame play possible. Through reflexive thematic analysis, we identify three themes that reflect the practical issues players grappled with, including game choice, game mode or setup, and technical implementation. Reflecting on the challenges and opportunities associated with these issues, we consider their implications for DHDB design more generally. In doing so, we present the DHYE (Distanced Hybrid plaY Experience) framework, a practical set of design considerations that emphasises an understanding of distance not simply as an obstacle to enjoyable boardgame play but as an inspiration for novel and meaningful design.",

These models have begun to rival the work of professional creatives, and sparked discussions on the future of creative work, loss of jobs, and copyright issues, amongst other important implications. To support the sustainable adoption of TTIG, we must provide rich, reliable and transparent insights into how professionals perceive, adopt and use TTIG. Crucially though, the public debate is shallow, narrow and lacking transparency, while academic work has focused on studying the use of TTIG in a general artist population, but not on the perceptions and attitudes of professionals in a specific industry. In this paper, we contribute a qualitative, exploratory interview study on TTIG in the Finnish videogame industry. Through a Template Analysis on semi-structured interviews with 14 game professionals, we reveal 12 overarching themes, structured into 39 sub-themes on professionals' perception, adoption and use of TTIG in games industry practice. Experiencing (yet another) change of roles and creative processes, our participants' reflections can inform discussions within the industry, be used by policymakers to inform urgently needed legislation, and support researchers in games, HCI and AI to support the sustainable, professional use of TTIG, and foster games as cultural artefacts.",

      "abstract": "At times, the interfaces of videogames -- gameworlds -- contain tiny details that go unnoticed. One such detail is how designers employ ! and ? to communicate to players. These punctuation marks have existed in videogames since their creation, yet remain undiscussed by designers. They are used as ways to promote curiosity, as objects, as ways to symbolize excitement, and as a prompt to react. Their varied history is deserving of attention, so we present a chronicle of two pieces of gameworld punctuation: ! and ?. We discuss current and past uses and identify more ways that these could be used in the future. These symbols may present a useful space of inquiry not only for games and games research, but more generally, in terms of the rapid communication of complex information.",

      "abstract": "Spectating digital games can be exciting. However, due to its vicarious nature, spectators often wish to engage in the gameplay beyond just watching and cheering. To blur the boundaries between spectators and players, we propose a novel approach called ``Fused Spectatorship'', where spectators watch their hands play games by loaning bodily control to a computational Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) system. To showcase this concept, we designed three games where spectators loan control over both their hands to the EMS system and watch them play these competitive and collaborative games. A study with 12 participants suggested that participants could not distinguish if they were watching their hands play, or if they were playing the games themselves.  We used our results to articulate four spectator experience themes and four fused spectator types, the behaviours they elicited and offer one design consideration to support each of these behaviours. We also discuss the ethical design considerations of our approach to help game designers create future fused spectatorship experiences.",

      "abstract": "The massive growth of esports has vitalized the need to study human performance in competitive video gaming. The pressure of competitive play elicits a range of emotional experiences, which can affect players during and beyond a gaming session. In this work, we review the state of the literature concerning the role emotions play in esports performance as well as highlight coping strategies players use to regulate emotions during competitive play. We review the findings of N=32 peer-reviewed articles pertaining to emotions and esports, finding that the emotional experiences elicited by competitive play affect esports performance. In response, players attempt to regulate their emotions to maintain performance; however, efforts to do so vary, as they currently lack effective coping strategies. Lastly, we review the potential of technical interventions in esports training for improving emotion regulation among players. Our findings support knowledge development in esports, and present avenues towards promoting the emotional wellbeing of competitive gamers.",

      "abstract": "Widespread climate change engagement is needed to confront our current environmental crises, but it remains difficult to attain. Methods such as visualizations and experiential learning activities, including games and gamification, have been proposed to engage citizens beyond what generic and one-way information sharing can, but rigorous studies comparing the effects of game-based learning with traditional methods are rare. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of a serious game vs. control on learning outcomes related to climate change concepts. We conducted an experiment involving N=105 participants randomly assigned to two treatment groups (a desktop screen-based video game and an immersive VR version of the same game) and a control (a text with charts) and investigated the differences between pre- and post-intervention measures of knowledge. The results show that all three conditions had a large effect on learning, but there were no significant improvement differences between groups. Therefore, video games, either on desktop or virtual reality, may be as effective as more traditional instructional materials. Based on detailed observations of the questionnaire data, we also provide game design recommendations. Future studies could focus on specific features of learning and cognitive engagement and expand this experimental design to affect and behavior.",

      "abstract": "The convergence of gaming and gambling, known as \"gamblification\", has been a topic of increasing interest in recent years. Loot boxes, i.e., rewards offering randomized content in exchange for money or time, have been a particular focal point. Research has shown links between excessive loot box consumption and problematic consumption behaviors, leading to several attempts to regulate loot boxes. Arguments against regulation have been that loot boxes are conceptually and structurally akin to other unregulated game formats, such as collectible card games. However, this discourse is often without deeper analysis of the mechanics of different products at the center of convergence. Therefore, to add to this knowledge, this article examines the similarities and differences between booster packs in Magic Arena, their physical counterparts in Magic: The Gathering, and loot boxes included in digital games. Particular attention is paid to the ways in which these booster packs compare to loot boxes in terms of consumption patterns, visual appearance, contextual factors, and regulation. Analysis reveals that digital booster packs in Magic Arena differ from both loot boxes and physical card packs, both due to their direct impact on gameplay, and their unique features afforded by the digital environment in which they exist.",

      "abstract": "We present Creative Console, a player-driven game in which a player, without prior knowledge of game programming, can design and realize a game within 15 minutes. Players design a game by selecting, adding, or changing a game component and then playtesting the game immediately. We refer to this central process as the Fast-Evolving-And-Verifying (FEAV) module. Players play successive FEAV modules, each taking around 3 minutes, and progressively complete a game design. We conducted an exploratory study of Creative Console. Within 48 hours, all 21 participants developed 527 game levels, covering 10 genres of games. The study demonstrates that Creative Console is enjoyable to play and effectively empowers creative and diversified game design. We furthermore conducted a grounded theory analysis of their design process. Our analysis concludes that modular FEAV, serendipity, and social communication are the three pillars of Creative Console, which casts light on future player-driven creative design systems.",

      "abstract": "We lack a shared and detailed understanding in gamification of what game elements are. To address this, we provide a scoping review of the last five years of gamification research, focusing primarily on how game elements have been applied and characterized. We retrieved the definitions of game elements from 280 research papers, conducted a content analysis, and identified their features. On the basis of this information, we provide responses regarding the frequently cited game elements, whether they are consistently characterized in the literature, and the frequently stated features of these elements. Our research has identified 15 game elements in the literature, with points, badges, and leaderboards being the most prevalent. As a first step toward clear definitions, we suggest a set of properties to characterize these game elements. The results of our review contribute to the formation of a consensus among gamification scholars about the application and definition of game elements.",

      "abstract": "Video games are increasingly designed to provoke reflection and challenge players' perspectives. Yet we know little about how such perspective-challenging experiences come about in gameplay. In response, we used systematic self-observation diaries and micro-phenomenological interviews to capture players' (n=15) lived experience of perspective challenges in purposely sampled games including Hatoful Boyfriend, The Stanley Parable, or Papers, Please. We found a sequence of trigger, reflection, and transformation constituting perspective-challenging experiences, matching Mezirow's model of transformative learning. Most of these were game-related or `endo-game', suggesting that medium self-reflection could be an overlooked part of everyday game reflection and appreciation. Reflections were accompanied by a wide range of emotions, including frequent epistemic emotions, and emotions could change drastically even during short gameplay experiences. Actual perspective change or transformation was rare. We construct a model of granular types of triggers, reflections, and transformations that can aid reflective game design.",

This paper presents an analysis of data practices in 21 online games and a qualitative interview study (N=20) that explores players' views on sharing their data in online games. Our results show that players' willingness to share personal information is contextual and related to game settings and game design elements. Our findings also highlight players' misconceptions and concerns surrounding data collection in games, and approaches to mitigate these concerns. Finally, this work identifies questionable design practices with online games and suggests design implications that will increase transparency and player control over data sharing.",

      "abstract": "Most research on Location-Based Games (LBGs) has been conducted on non-disabled players, meaning the experiences of disabled players are not well understood and potentially overlooked. As such, this research aimed to address the following questions: 1). What are the barriers and needs of disabled LBGs players? 2). How can LBGs be made more inclusive and accessible? To address these questions, two studies were conducted in the form of an online qualitative questionnaire and a series of co-design workshops. Results articulate the needs, barriers, and desired features of 60 participants.  Based on our findings and through the collaborative work with disabled players we articulate 4 guidelines for game designers and developers aimed at improving the accessibility of LBGs: 1) Adding avatar features that better represent disabled characteristics, 2). Providing different input options for phone interactions, 3) Allowing for disabled specific accounts and 4) Introducing a messenger feature to LBGs. ",

      "abstract": "Previous work shows that high latency, a prolonged delay between player in- and system output, negatively affects player experience and performance. However, previous work also comes to contrary conclusions about how the in-game perspective alters the latency sensitivity of video games. Currently, it is unclear if the in-game perspective independently modulates latency's effects. To investigate how a game's in-game perspective interacts with latency, we developed a shooting game incorporating three perspectives (First-Person-, Third-Person-, and Bird's-Eye-View). In a study, participants (N = 36) played with two levels of latency (low and high) and the three perspectives. We show that latency reduces performance and experience, independent of the perspective. Moreover, Bayesian analysis suggests that the in-game perspective does not interact with latency and does not affects performance or experience. We conclude that more robust means to categorize latency sensitivity of video games than the in-game perspective are required.",

Differently from past works, this system can generate music and images simultaneously, preserving human intent and coherency. We present our algorithm for the generation of audiovisual instances and also a system based on this approach, verifying the quality of the outcomes it can produce in light of current approaches for the generation of images and music. We also instigate the discussion around the new paradigm in arts, where the creative process is delegated to autonomous systems, with limited human participation. Our user study (N=74) shows that our approach overcomes current deep learning models in terms of quality, being recognized as human production, as if the outcome were being generated out of an endless musical improvisation performance.",

      "abstract": "Despite the prevalence and relevance of jump scares in horror video games, there is little empirical research on them. While HCI research commonly uses horror games as experimental stimuli, even less scientific research exists on what makes a jump scare in a game more or less scary. The present between-subject study (n=60) addresses this by investigating whether jump scare intensity—measured physiologically and subjectively—scales with task difficulty. We triggered in-game jump scares at increasing levels of mental workload across four counterbalanced conditions, manipulated using N-back tasks of varying difficulty. Results demonstrate a significant linear relationship between mental workload and physiological arousal. However, this is not the case for subjective perception of arousal elicited by the jump scare. These findings have design implications for horror games. They show that the level of physiological arousal caused by a jump scare can be controlled by changing the difficulty of an in-game task that necessitates a substantial amount of mental work at the same time.",

      "abstract": "Water's pleasant nature and associated health benefits have captivated the interest of HCI researchers. Prior WaterHCI work mainly focused on advancing instrumental applications, such as improving swimming performance, and less on designing systems that support interacting with technology in water in more playful contexts. In this regard, we propose floatation tanks as research vehicles to investigate the design of playful interactive water experiences. Employing somaesthetic design, we developed a playful extended reality floatation tank experience: \"Fluito\". We conducted a 13-participant study to understand how specific design features amplified participants' water experiences. We used a postphenomenological lens to articulate eight strategies useful for designers aiming to develop digital playful experiences in water, such as designing to call attention to the water and designing to encourage breathing and body awareness in water experiences. Ultimately, we hope that our work supports people to be playful and benefit from the many advantages of being in water.",

      "abstract": "Structured curriculum in domain-specific knowledge and personal development of graduate attributes are both important components of tertiary education. Prior gamification research in tertiary education has mostly evaluated gamification as a system and largely in structured curriculum-based learning environments. There is insufficient understanding as to how different gamification mechanics affect learning experiences in self-driven personal development areas outside of the structured curriculum. We present a study with 20 tertiary students over seven days with AdventureLEARN, a gamified online platform to engage students in a self-driven journey of continuous personal development alongside their curriculum work. Through an analysis of data collected from experience sampling and focus group discussions, we found that, amongst other findings, gamification mechanics that were meticulously contextualized to specific platform features afforded the most positive experiences across various dimensions, leading to our main insight highlighting the importance of maintaining a co-development process between individual gamification mechanics and platform features.",

      "abstract": "We present ExpanStick, a novel thumbstick that augments video game interaction using the force that the user applies at the physical limit of the gamepad. Gamers frequently manipulate a thumbstick leaning on the limit, or physical boundary around it, either to apply maximum input or to secure physical support, which makes the contact force an easily accessible input channel. The ExpanStick preserves the form factor and usability of the thumbstick, while expanding its input space. We built the ExpanStick and inserted it in a commercial gamepad as a proof-of-concept prototype. Using the prototype, we conducted a design workshop with console gamers to design the ExpanStick game interaction. Through demonstration of the interactions, we found the early use experience with the ExpanStick is positive and well accepted by the game players.",

      "abstract": "Many trans people experience gender dysphoria -- distress caused by mismatches in internal and external experiences of gender. Video games engage intimately with the self, creating intense experiences involving identities, bodies, and social interaction. This combination of factors renders trans players vulnerable to gender dysphoria triggers: failures of interaction design that result in gender dysphoria. The present research undertakes a thematic analysis of four popular games, drawn from an initial corpus of 31. It contributes a definition of gender dysphoria triggers, case studies of triggering games, an initial gender dysphoria categorization to provide a useful design language, and examples of alternative designs for extant triggers. The analysis combines the authors' positionality as trans gamers; critical cultural studies methodologies, including textual analysis; a critical discourse analysis of production-side statements and interviews and player-side comments about diversity in those games; and close readings of the games themselves. The paper concludes with a call for trans inclusivity in game design, which we structure around the necropolitical concept of the relation of care.",

      "abstract": "A large number of mobile apps support the sustainable use of food. These apps often use playful elements to enhance the user experience and promote their long-term use. However, we know little about which conceptual aspects of gamification and which gamified elements are actually used in the context of sustainable food apps. Therefore, in this paper, we analyse 76 mobile apps from the Google Play Store found with the term 'sustainable food' of which we analyse 27 apps in detail using the Gameful Design Heuristics. Our analysis uncovers a low average heuristics score and an unbalanced usage of subheuristics and heuristic categories. Additionally, gamification is unevenly distributed among food themes and sustainability categories. This study's results contribute to the research on commercial gamified apps related to sustainability and food. Thus, this paper contributes to gamification design by identifying design opportunities that serve as interesting starting points for future work.",

      "abstract": "Most digital bodily games focus on the body as they use movement as input. However, they also draw the player’s focus away from the body as the output occurs on visual displays, creating a divide between the physical body and the virtual world. We propose a novel approach – the \"Body as a Play Material\" – where a player uses their body as both input and output to unify the physical body and the virtual world. To showcase this approach, we designed three games where a player uses one of their hands (input) to play against the other hand (output) by loaning control over its movements to an Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) system. We conducted a thematic analysis on the data obtained from a field study with 12 participants to articulate four player experience themes. We discuss our results about how participants appreciated the engagement with the variety of bodily movements for play and the ambiguity of using their body as a play material. Ultimately, our work aims to unify the physical body and the virtual world.",

      "abstract": "We argue that HCI games research can benefit by understanding experiences of \"jank\". Jank is a gaming vernacular term for game-elements that are somehow “off”: sloppy, glitchy, or clumsy. Examples include frustrating control schemes, primitive visuals, absurd physics errors, and NPCs with wooden, alienating behaviour. Importantly, ‘jank’ is no straightforward term of abuse: players use the term appreciatively, even with affection. Attention to the ``paradox'' of jank-appreciation can help us understand the limits of usability in understanding player experience. It can clarify conditions which foster reflection and appreciation of adversity, and shed light on games as aesthetic experiences.",

This paper aims to inspire the games community by highlighting the potential of using player data for creating new interactions and play experiences. We raise technical, design, psychological, and ethical questions and argue for using player data more boldly and ambitiously, empowering players to shape their experiences and the game through their own data. By doing so, data transforms from being an analytical to a creative asset, seamlessly enhancing the exchange between games and players.",

We may need a super power—or super method—from another world. I outline three motivations for jump-starting research synthesis in games user research. I argue that: research synthesis will validate this field of study and enrich primary research (meta-scholarship); we must level up both primary and secondary research (education); and we should reflect this epistemological stance in community structures and adopt established tools and protocols (standardiza- tion). I offer power-ups to get the toads rolling.",

      "abstract": "Asymmetric games create unique and engaging player experiences that can draw together players from multiple demographics.But maintaining a strong level of interaction between different player roles poses a challenge, which is exacerbated in competitive games. This paper seeks to find solutions to this problem in the context of RaceTrap, a competitive asymmetric racing game. RaceTrap combines card-playing and racing elements, where one player uses cards to create obstacles and the other tries to avoid these obstacles while driving in Virtual Reality. We address the central challenge of coupling, or maintaining a high level of awareness and interaction between the roles. The paper reviews existing approaches to coupling in asymmetric cooperative games, and highlights the needs for an improved coupling in competitive asymmetric games. We present features implemented in RaceTrap to improve coupling. These solutions highlight the importance of coupling in the emerging field of asymmetric games.",

      "abstract": "Digital gaming and playful environments are often viewed as entertainment computing technologies that aim to create fun, engaging, and positive experiences. Yet, there is an increasing interest in research that protects players from the problematic side of gaming and playful environments, including but not limited to: toxicity and hate in online games; harassment in social VR; ethical considerations of monetization; dark patterns and deceptive design; problematic gaming, obsessive passion, and addiction; discrimination in playful contexts; the incubation of extremism within gaming; tensions between economic benefits and the focus on artistic and cultural values in game development, and unethical practices of game studios. These concerns are heightened even more when children enter these gaming and playful environments, as children are still forming their identities, are likely to have greater difficulty with making considered and forthright decisions, and have a lower ability to discern content than adults.\r\n\r\nHowever, behaviors that some consider negative or harmful may not be intended or even perceived as such by others. For example, game studios may have the need to incorporate monetization into games to make money because it is a business that creates jobs; players may like the opportunity to spend money on loot boxes rather than viewing it as exploitative or gambling because it improves their gaming experiences and performance; players may consider high engagement with games as dedication or professionalism while others view it as obsession and addiction; some players may normalize or even enjoy trash talk as an essential part of their online gaming experience while it can disrupt other players’ experiences; and some people may view children creating content as enabling children’s creativity, independence, and self-agency, whereas others may question how these children are being used as laborers for game studios. \r\n\r\nWe understand that people have diverse perspectives and feelings toward the problematic side of games and play, but also that there is an urgent need to combat the harm to players and communities that result from these damaging practices and community norms. Therefore, this workshop aims to encourage researchers, industry practitioners, and game designers to bring in a wide variety of perspectives on how to articulate problematic play, what factors lead to the subjective nature of the problematic side of play, and approaches to combat harm across gaming and playful contexts while reinforcing potentially beneficial aspects of what can be ambiguously defined as problematic by others. \r\n",

We present LEVI, a standalone adaptive board game system (ABGs) using RFID technology to adapt the gameplay experience for board games for players with or without visual impairment. As many hybrid board game systems often require costly resources (digital elements) which may not be accessible to the user, we considered low-cost alternatives to our solution. Given the various gameplay styles in board games, we mainly focus on audio adaptation for this game system. We present an evaluation of our current proof-of-concept game system and future possibilities of using our adaptive board game system.",

      "abstract": "The real-time detection of when a player is struggling presents an opportunity for game designers to design timely and meaningful interventions, as well as to provide targeted support that improves student learning and engagement. In this paper, we present a struggle detector in the context of students playing the learning game, Wake: Tales from the Aqualab. Using the interaction log data of the game, we engineered four sets of features that captured distinct aspects of gameplay and trained prediction models to identify human-coded cases of students struggling, cross-validating at the student level. Our best-performing detectors have shown some capability in identifying student struggles with modest performance, at an AUC (Area Under the Curve) value of 0.635. We discuss current limitations of this approach, as well as next steps towards providing real-time support within the game.",

      "abstract": "Understanding of player experiences in games necessitates acknowledging the role of mental effort, which intertwines with sentiments like fun, immersion, and frustration. This study adopts a qualitative approach from a constructivist perspective to gain insights into the subjective experiences of effort in gameplay. To capture the intricate nature of player effort, we iteratively employed a range of data collection methods, including post-gameplay interviews, written narratives, speculative modification discussions, and experience sampling techniques. Each method provided unique insights into different facets of effort, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the subjective dimensions involved. These methods were carefully assessed based on their depth of insights, the nature of data collected, participant engagement, researcher’s bias, and practical feasibility. The study uncovered that focus group interviews effectively distilled complex ideas, while retrospective methods had limitations in capturing associated emotions. In contrast, experience sampling, particularly when written in the first person, provided a detailed description of the nuanced dynamics of effort and other related emotions throughout the gameplay experience.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents \"The Sea is a Sky,\" an immersive virtual reality (VR) poetry experience that takes inspiration from the Cuban poem \"Del Otro Lado Del Mar,\" which translates to \"on the other side of the sea.\" In this VR game, players are transported into the journey of a Cuban immigrant as they leave their homeland in search of a better future in America. Through physical actions such as crawling, swimming, and rowing within the VR environment, players embody the struggles and challenges faced by the immigrant protagonist. Throughout the experience, they encounter visionary hallucinations and hear messages of hope for the future as they navigate the vast ocean. However, the game also highlights the tragic reality of many Cuban immigrants who have lost their lives while attempting to cross the treacherous sea. The theme of drowning serves as a poignant symbol of their plight. The development of \"The Sea is a Sky\" involved collaboration among students from diverse disciplines, including English Literature, Computer Science, and Digital Arts. The project aims to achieve two primary objectives: raising awareness about social issues related to refugees and immigrants, and pushing the boundaries of game design by creating an engaging experience for younger generations to connect with poetry through the medium of virtual reality. While poetry has the inherent power to evoke deep reflection, it often struggles to resonate with younger individuals in its traditional forms. By harnessing the potential of virtual reality, our project seeks to expand the horizons of traditional poetry and explore innovative ways of experiencing it in the digital realm. The design and implementation of our VR experience not only offer a unique and engaging approach to poetry but also have the potential to inform future applications of VR in digital poetry and the cultivation of empathy among audiences.",

This format has become popular in the gaming community, with series like Ludum Dare and Global Game Jam. However, it is unclear how participants in game jams fit into the larger gaming culture in terms of their motivations and identities as gamers. Our paper surveys two game jam populations to determine their player motivation profiles, roles in the development teams, and opinions on their gamer identity. Our analysis shows that the player motivation profiles are similar to those found in the general gamer population rather than being focused on specific types of motivation. We also found interesting correlations between roles in game development teams and motivation types.",

      "abstract": "Are educational games bad? It’s a loaded question. It presumes a singular understanding of the term, a binary-moral experience, and supposes some comparison typically to commercial counterparts. The focus should not even be on games, but the sites of creation. Educational games are situated at a point of contestation. Not only is it caught up in a definitional soup of various terms referencing the impact potential of games, but their creation is fragmented across spaces like academia, education, non-profits, and industry. This creates challenges in sharing knowledge, reaching audiences, and building a design space that wrestles with and grows in its variety. This panel attempts to rectify that by bringing together practitioners from various design and implementation spaces. It moves behind the binary of educational games as bad or good, and brings attention to the needs, gaps, and challenges of making effective learning games.\r\n\r\nThere is no particular “educational game,” but rather an approach to design and implementation that drives creation. Making for learning, while simple, is a convoluted process caught up in different challenges depending on where design occurs. This panel brings together voices from individuals in academia, industry, education, and non-profit sectors to provide a blended discussion on the difficulties of making and implementing educational games. It will focus on the support structures, design spaces, and implementation goals to articulate key points of concern across sectors and point to where support can come from in each.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of the conference, the discussion will examine play from a perspective of learning and design, specifically highlighting affordances and contexts for its design. Educational games are typically examined for their highly structured design processes, yet the success of popular commercial games in educational spaces (i.e. Minecraft), suggests a particular focus on dimensions of play and how they can tie into learning goals and structures. With this in mind, panelists will be urged to connect how their design approaches, spaces, and goals are aligned to play rather than final game products. This will allow the panel to encourage discussion on key points of scaffolding for cross-sector partnerships as well as recognize the needs in learning engagement that get left out in the current landscape.",

      "abstract": "Proactive actions are vital for promoting healthy aging, emphasizing the necessity to to address the physical, cognitive, and emotional needs through discipline-specific expertise. Exergames, with their inherent characteristics, offer the potential to bridge the gap between the disciplines of exertion, user experience, and games. This paper presents a formal co-creative interdisciplinary design process for VR exergame training to provide effective, enjoyable, and meaningful fall prevention training for healthy aging. Our process involves establishing expert-human relations, incorporating discipline-specific approaches and goals, and assigning an active designer for implementation. The approaches are deconstructed into the language of the active designer using a shared thesaurus and translated into the exergame through construction kits. An early-stage player study and expert assessment indicate positive results through our design process.",

It does so by combining insights from previous game streaming research with a new survey study conducted among Twitch users (N = 124) to understand how to use spectator characteristics, searching behaviour, motivations and stream(er) affordances as a way to control and enhance the search experience. Preliminary results from the survey are presented, as are a set of initial design goals to improve the spectator experience based on the uncovered findings. Moving forward, these design goals will be evaluated and refined through user interviews and an iterative user-centred design process of prototypes.",

      "abstract": "A player feeling stuck is a player who risks abandoning a game and all their progress. Currently, this experience is an under-explored area in literature and is mostly approached from an expert perspective. A better understanding from a player's perspective could bring new light on how to correctly identify when it happens and support the player in overcoming the obstacles. We particularly miss information if and how stuckness arises in different genres of games, as in the case of narrative or decision-making games where most goals will depend on the personal preference of the player. We present here a first qualitative study using a constructive grounded theory approach to understand how players experience stuckness. So far we conducted 9 interviews with players and contributed with 1) Thematic analysis of when and why stuckness arises with 37 examples. 2) An in-progress theory that demonstrated that stuckness is experienced in four phases (expectations, unprogress, evaluation, and resolution) and depends on the expectation of a fair and meaningful game. 3) Presenting different types of stuckness, including stuckness caused by expectation, game design balance, social interaction, or accessibility to the game challenge.

      "abstract": "Playtime holds great significance in the holistic development of children and young teens, both physically and mentally. Engaging with physical toys and participating in outdoor sports fosters essential skills such as spatial interaction, socialization, and communication in the real world. However, contemporary entertainment that targets young people is predominantly screen-based media, offering simulated worlds, captivating narratives, and interactive experiences. Consequently, children and teens spend substantial amounts of time indoors, preoccupied with online activities and digital content consumption. This paradigm shift towards digital entertainment poses developmental challenges due to the absence of tangibility and face-to-face interaction. This paper introduces Memeopoly, a novel AI-powered physical board game that synergies the strengths of tangible playtime with the dynamism and interactivity of the digital realm. Integrating AI technology into the traditional play framework augments the interactive nature of physical toys, enabling a richer and more engaging game-play environment. We designed our AI system in the game to harness and empower human creativity to generate unforeseen story lines personalized to players' unique preferences, thereby cultivating a thrilling gaming experience that surpasses the static and generic narratives typically found in traditional board games.",

      "abstract": "Games allow us to construct and explore identities and offer us role models, good and bad. Game characters are a reflection of us–players and creators alike–or could be. But do games also en- code identities, values, and orientations that transcend diegetic categories and player self-insertion? I explore the notion of game characters as conduits of transcendent models through the case study of Link from the Legend of Zelda series. I propose that designers embed tacit, nondiegetic patterns of praxis and complex value models, such as user-centred design, when crafting the embodiment of characters in gameplay, even unawares.",

      "abstract": "Music is ubiquitous in our everyday lives and its tempo can affect our experience and behavior, be it in movies to emphasize a scene, during sports to increase the flow of a workout, or in games to complement the gameplay. While the impact of fixed beats per minute on the latter has already been investigated, we focus on the effect of continuously increasing or decreasing beats per minute of background music during gameplay in an endless runner game on player performance, perceived difficulty and player experience. In our within-subjects design study (n=32), participants played an endless runner game with continuously increasing, decreasing, or constant and no background music. While we found no significant effects in terms of player performance, our findings show that perceived stress, motivation and entertainment were affected by the different music conditions.",

      "abstract": "Kawaii is the Japanese concept of cute++, a global export with local characteristics. Recent work has explored kawaii as a feature of user experience (UX) with social robots, virtual characters, and voice assistants, i.e., kawaii vocalics. Games have a long history of incorporating characters that use voice as a means of expressing kawaii. Nevertheless, no work to date has evaluated kawaii game voices or mapped out a model of kawaii game vocalics. In this work, we explored whether and how a model of kawaii vocalics maps onto game character voices. We conducted an online perceptions study (N=157) using 18 voices from kawaii characters in Japanese games. We replicated the results for computer voice and discovered nuanced relationships between gender and age, especially youth fulness, agelessness, gender ambiguity, and gender neutrality. We provide our initial model and advocate for future work on character visuals and within play contexts.",

      "abstract": "Short questionnaires, using only a few items for measuring user experience related constructs, have been used in a variety of domains. In the field of games, the miniPXI is such a validated short version of the player experience inventory (PXI), containing 11 single items to measure 11 different PX-related constructs. Previous validations of the miniPXI were carried out in an experimental setting with existing, fully finished games. In this study, we conduct a preliminary investigation of the potential of miniPXI to evaluate prototypes during game development. We explore differences in PX across two iterations of nine games prototypes, based on input from 16 participants. Findings suggest that the miniPXI is capable of detecting differences between the two prototype versions. In addition, at the level of individual games, the miniPXI is effective at identifying differences in nearly all PX dimensions. However, we also find limited use for the single enjoyment item, and suggest that including alternative measures such as the Net Promotor Score may be more useful. Overall, this work suggests that the miniPXI has the potential to evaluate different iterations of game prototypes, starting from the earliest stages of game development.",

      "abstract": "This research project aims to design and develop video games for studying and improving collaboration and collaboration skills. To this end, we reviewed the scientific literature across many disciplines, including psychology, computer science, and game theory. This literature review led to key insights and an attempt to develop a framework grounded in Reinforcement Learning Theory with the ambition of integrating a diversity of disparate scientific results but also to provide a lens through which to study existing multiplayer games as well as drive the development of research video games for studying and improving collaboration and collaboration skills. We will review commercial multiplayer games to identify key concepts and mechanics that game designers use for engaging collaborative gameplay. We will then develop game prototypes based on both our theoretical framework and our video game reviews and conduct small-scale user tests to help us identify the most promising ideas and to iteratively update the framework and game design for future  large-scale experimental studies. Here we present key ideas behind this project; it is still in its early stages and could greatly benefit from discussions with the CHI-Play community.",

      "abstract": "Our new work culture relies heavily on online meetings and computer-mediated communication (CMC). However, making an online meeting engaging while keeping communication productive is a major challenge. We collected quantitative data from the user engagement scale (UES) and qualitative data from semi-structured interviews to investigate how user engagement differed. Using the gamified web-conferencing platform Gather, we compared four communication channels: (1) audio-only, (2) audio and video (no avatar), (3) audio and avatar (no video), and (4) audio and video and avatar. We began qualitative data analysis using reflexive thematic analysis. Although the UES results did not reveal significant differences, the preliminary results from the thematic analysis such as people prefer communication platforms designed for specific use cases because video makes them feel more self-conscious, while avatars make them feel more represented. Lastly, we provide a work-in-progress applied definition of user engagement in communication channels with their perspective on individual engagement constructs. ",

Prior research has identified three markers of authenticity in microstreams: unscripted interactions, low production values, and unstaged backgrounds. This study experimentally manipulates these markers to examine their individual and joint effects on perceived authenticity, as well as enjoyment of the streamed content. The findings will contribute to understanding the factors influencing perceived authenticity in microstreaming and shed light on how audience engage with online content creators.",

      "abstract": "Toxicity and harmful conduct in competitive gaming spaces is a prevalent topic in games research as well as investigating coping strategies and tools for gamers to mitigate its negative effects. These investigations include practicing different forms of emotion self-regulation, specifically in the context of team-based eSports. The fighting game community, however, has yet to be explored in current literature regarding toxic behavior and self-regulation. We address this research gap and explore fostering self-regulation practices among fighting game players by introducing Shouting Match, an alternative controller two-player 2D fighting game that uses shout commands as a core game mechanic. We use novel methods of embodied play, utilizing the expressive vocal culture of the fighting game community and having players practice self-regulation through controlling their vocal expressions. For this work-in-progress, we report on a preliminary user study that evaluates usability and intuitiveness of our current, low-fidelity prototype of Shouting Match. We extended the usability evaluation with a focus group to assess attitudes and collect insights regarding the system's enjoyability, playability, and prospects in emotion self-regulation. Lastly, we define three key considerations through our findings that will inform future directions of Shouting Match and give initial insights for researchers interested in embodied play for prosocial impact.

      "abstract": "We present three game demos built using our game streaming system, MARS (Metadata Augmented Real-time Streaming). Current streaming interfaces fall short of providing viewer interaction mechanisms beyond the chat channel. Additionally, personalized interaction, where viewers can independently interact with the game content being streamed, is not widely supported. We used MARS to render real-time metadata from the game being streamed onto an overlay that viewers can interact with. In building MARS, we enabled the creation of novel viewing experiences and established a design space that needs to be explored further. We created three demo games to showcase MARS' capabilities; a tower defense game with contextual information available for viewers, a visual novel with accessibility features enabled, and an asymmetric cooperative game requiring the streamer and viewers to work together. The focus of this paper is on motivating our design decisions for the demos and what potential they hold for playful experiences in live streaming. To this end, we use three games as probes into this yet unexplored design space, with the end-goal of creating novel stream experiences using the MARS system.\r\n",

Circular breathing allows players to produce continuous sound beyond the duration of a single breath by exhaling through the mouth while simultaneously inhaling through the nose. However, mastering this technique traditionally requires repetitive and often monotonous practice. To address this, we present a novel approach to skill acquisition that leverages gameplay with our breath control system, Fulow. Fulow uniquely controls the user's exhalation involuntarily through facial vibrations, eliminating the need for users to consciously control their exhalation. This innovative feature allows users to effortlessly perform circular breathing. Interaction with Fulow through our designed breathing games is expected to facilitate easy and enjoyable learning of circular breathing, demonstrating the potential of human augmentation technologies as novel game controllers for skill acquisition through gameplay.",

      "abstract": "Can plants play games? Considering what play might mean for “the more-than-human” can provide alternate perspective for what play means for ourselves as humans. It can also open a way for rethinking relations between ourselves and other entities that share our world. Kara Stone argues for the importance of considering play for non-human players, drawing on feminist and posthumanist philosophy. In this paper I take a similar approach of speculative imagining of plants as players, our relation to plants and to plant-being, and present an example of a videogame artwork designed for a plant to play.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a playful constructive visualization workshop for students aged 9 to 15. The workshop aims to explore how using playful elements, such as LEGO bricks, physical building blocks, or paper and colored pencils, can increase students' engagement in exploring data through the construction of visualizations. The paper also discusses related work in visualization education and playful teaching methods, such as constructive exercises using plastic tokens or LEGO bricks. Playful learning environments can enhance student motivation and produce the joy of learning.  Constructing visualizations manually using playful materials can help students better understand data and interpret visualizations by providing a tangible ``object to think'' with.",

      "abstract": "Video games are an important form of entertainment and have become an increasingly popular pastime in the 21st Century. However, many people with disabilities are still excluded from gaming due to accessibility barriers. While some progress has been made in recognizing accessibility as a design value, there is still a significant need for further advancements in game accessibility. Our research analyzes accessibility features in games across genres and platforms (PC, Console, Mobile, VR). Using Interactive Process Modelling (IPM), we map customizable accessibility options available in different games. We present our methodology for conducting interviews with game designers and gamers with disabilities to provide insights into existing options.  The research project will result in the development of an accessibility-focused framework for game designers that will enable them to effectively design new customizable accessibility options for their players. Through this research, we aim to contribute to the broader discourse on accessibility and inclusivity in gaming for individuals with disabilities. This work-in-progress paper presents the ongoing progress of our research and invites feedback from the community.",

These emotions vary among players due to individual differences, ultimately shaping their\r\nemotional responses experienced by players during gameplay and exploring the correlation between player traits and behaviours. By utilising a turn-based strategy game, we employed a combination of self-report measures and behavioural observations to assess players’ emotional changes across varying game difficulty levels. Our results revealed that the hard game session elicited higher levels of arousal and negative emotion in players compared to the easy game session. Furthermore, we observed that players with a low extroversion tendency exhibited a higher inclination towards exploration behaviour in the game. This research provides initial insights into the complex interplay between player emotions, in-game behaviour and individual differences across game difficulties.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Toxicity is a common problem in online games. Players regularly experience negative, hateful, or inappropriate behavior during gameplay. Intervention systems can help combat toxicity but are not widely available and or even comprehensively studied regarding their approaches and effectiveness. To assess the current state of toxicity intervention research, we are conducting a systematic literature review about intervention methods for toxic behaviors in online video games. In this work-in-progress, we report the research protocol for this review and the results from a preliminary analysis. We collected 1176 works from 4 digital libraries and performed abstract and full-text screening, resulting in 30 relevant papers containing 36 By analyzing these intervention systems, we found: 1) Most research proposes novel approaches (n =28) instead of analyzing existing interventions. 2) Most systems intervene only after toxicity occurs (n = 31) with few interventions that act before toxicity. 3) Only few interventions are evaluated with players and in commercial settings (n=5), highlighting the potential for more research with higher external validity. In our ongoing work, we are conducting an in-depth analysis of the interventions providing insights into their approaches and effectiveness. This work is the first step toward effective toxicity interventions that can mitigate harm to players.",

We present Trouble Maker, an open-source physical device that generates whimsical truth-or-dare prompts using Markov chain with a single button press. Our device autonomously generates surprising and unpredictable prompts through a lightweight machine learning algorithm, printed by a thermal printer, integrated altogether as a tangible artifact. Results from the preliminary user study show prompts based on our method amused and surprised players, and the device increased the overall playfulness and engagement of the game.",

In this paper, we argue that this is a narrow perspective which no longer aligns with how policy makers and other fields view the construct, and limits our research community in how we understand the potential harms of play: First, We deconstruct vulnerability and question who is vulnerable in which context, and then we explore the relationship between vulnerability, game design, and mundane types of harm. We conclude with challenges and opportunities for our community. ",

      "abstract": "Sports is greatly valued both for its internal benefits (e.g., joy and fulfilment) and its external benefits (e.g., physical health). Still, many people struggle to find or uphold the motivation to practice sports. To ameliorate this issue, researchers in the field of SportsHCI have been actively exploring various gamification strategies. In this contribution, we critically reflect on the `what’, `how’, and `why’ of gamification in sports. We argue against the use of gamification for `quick wins’, instead we argue that gamification can only be truly successful if it supports the spontaneous, self-sustained, and autotelic propensity in people to play sports.",

      "abstract": "The field of Game-Based Learning has contributed advances that help us understand how people learn from gameplay, in what context they might learn best, and what domains might be best suited to playful learning. While there has been a growth in our understanding of the space of theory and development in educational game design, there has been a relatively less work done in developing common methods and approaches for understanding learning in games. This is particularly apparent in contexts where gameplay is highly varied or complex and where learning might only be apparent across a range of player behaviors. The field of Game Analytics has tools that could be leveraged in this space, however, they have generally not been applied to questions of learning. To address this need for further common techniques within the field we have created the Open Game Data Project with the goal of fostering a community of researchers who are interested in understanding approaches to game-based learning analytics and working toward a common toolbox of methods.\r\n\r\nThis session will showcase this growing community with a masterclass in the form of an open consulting session with the game based learning analytics researchers. In this session a researcher or developer from Field Day will come to a panel of experts including the authors with a game based learning research question that they are interested in exploring. The experts will then work with them to determine how best to approach it both in instrumentation of data, engineering of data features, and development of analytic strategies. The goal of doing this consulting session in public will be to serve as a worked example of how experts think about approaching this space and expose attendees to tools and methods that exist in the context of a grounded case. Attendees will then be able to come away with an impression of different kinds of methods and techniques and also infrastructural supports that exist as well as join the community and go on to contribute to the growth of the field in their own ways.\r\n",

      "abstract": "When conducting research in online worlds, researchers can rely on practical and theoretical guidelines (Kozinets, 2019), which were however elaborated for the protection of the participants and do not take into account the potential risks to which the researchers themselves may be exposed. In fact, to investigate online communities, game researchers need a significant amount of insider knowledge, which is required for them to enter these complex online environments (Morris, 2004). Recently, the vulnerability of researchers in the online world and the consequences of abuse and harassment have been the subject of discussion among scholars (Marwick et al., 2016; Allison, 2020) and especially by female researchers investigating male-dominated gaming communities (Nakamura, 2014). In this workshop we aim to bring to light the variability of the experiences of researchers subject to their backgrounds, research interests, and methods.\r\nPrevious workshops have successfully assembled HCI researchers together to raise the variety of ethical challenges they face while undertaking their work (Waycott et al., 2016), suggesting means to seek help and ways to minimize risks. \r\nGame communities have a unique reputation for toxic behaviors both in-game and beyond, once referred to as “toxic technocultures” (Massanari, 2017) that game researchers are exposed to in the conduction of their study. The identity of the researchers poses the biggest challenge. When the methodology concerns interactive components such as interviews or focus groups, researchers are expected to reveal their identity as part of the procedure. However, when the researchers do not corroborate with the preconceived identity of someone who \"belongs\" to the gaming community (Braithwaite, 2016), they are often subject to gatekeeping or toxic behaviors, preventing them from their initial capacity to even access any viable subjects or data. Equally important is how such behaviors of the players impact the researchers themselves. Social scientists who frequent toxic online communities have called for the need to better protect the researchers who find themselves in the blind spots of qualitative research, which present unforeseen risks to their personal well-being (Stein & Appel, 2021). Even when the methodology does not involve interactive components, researchers collecting secondary data or conducting observational studies in order to understand player behavior could still be exposed to harmful events such as hate speech and extremist ideologies.\r\nDespite the growing attention to promoting researcher protection (Waycott et al., 2016; Stein & Appel, 2021; Doerfler et al., 2021), the specific requirements demanded in the context of gaming are overlooked. Researchers involved with game communities face significant challenges which they would not typically receive in other types of environments. Given the growing interest in investigating the impact of games on our everyday social lives, active debate in this area is warranted to better inform and protect current and future researchers in the field.

      "abstract": "Gender representation in games is an important consideration at least in part due to its pervasiveness, from toxicity shown towards both non-male players and non-male people that work in the industry, to the sexualisation of characters and persistence of tropes like the damsel in distress. Player churn is an important concept for industry as it shows disengagement from the product and can cause the developer to lose income, such as through lost microtransaction revenue, and cause higher acquisition costs to replace the lost players. Despite the first male protagonist appearing on screens in 1968, it took until 1996 for the first female protagonist to be developed in the form of Lara Croft and, despite progress, gender representation in games still has room for improvement.  To critically assess and analyse this issue, this paper explores a history of damsels, design of protagonists, gender identity and cultivation theory. To contribute towards the literature on player churn and gender representation, this paper investigated player churn through protagonist gender.  A Brunner-Munzel test was conducted to compare the gender of the protagonist (males or non-males) of 48 games with player churn.  Gender was identified through either self-identification of the protagonist in-game, or through pronouns used by other characters when referring to them.  Player churn was identified as the difference in daily players playing the game averaged over the first 7 days from the release of a game, days 30-37 from release and days 90-97 from release.  This data was acquired from SteamDB, which records daily players of games that are played through the Steam client.  Whilst no significant difference was found after either 30-37 days or 90-97 days between the two conditions, within the games investigated, those with a male protagonist generally attracted higher initial playerbases and also saw a steeper drop off in these players after both 30-37 days and 90-97 days.  Whilst this could indicate that, despite not attracting as many players initially, games with non-male protagonists attract a more loyal playerbase.  These results show that investigation of player churn in this way shows promise to quantifying gender representation.  ",

      "abstract": "Climate change poses a serious threat to human well-being and life on Earth. To avoid global warming's worst consequences every effort is needed, which requires cognitively, affectively and behaviorally engaging of as many of us as possible. However, climate change engagement is far from easy or simple, with manifold personal and contextual variables affecting our connection with the issue. Because of this, games and gamification have been proposed as visual, interactive, and motivating methods to support people in their engagement journey. Despite dozens of climate change-relevant digital games existing, some configurations are under-explored, including messaging frames such as health, engagement dimensions beyond knowledge, technologies such as immersive virtual reality (VR), and controlled experimental research methods. In this article, we present Climate Connected: Outbreak, a story-based single-player game for immersive VR and traditional computer screens that approaches climate change as a planetary health and well-being issue and supports players in their affective and behavioral connection to it. The game takes place in 2050 and connects day-to-day objects with systemic issues. Two versions can be played, one featuring an unnamed distant place and the other located in Tampere, Finland. The game has been used in research and has led to nuanced understandings of the players' experience, as well as learning, attitude, and self-efficacy gains.",

      "abstract": "Game design has been video-driven, and sound has been treated as something that augments the effects of video. On the other hand, for visually impaired people to play video games, they need to be able to control the game using only sound, but there have been a few video games that serve this function. However, The Last of Us: Part II, released in 2020, made a global splash by allowing visually impaired gamers to play the game using only sound, without the help of a sighted person. Using the video of a visually impaired person playing this game and his own commentary, this study analyzes the role and effect of auditory cues in enabling play and discusses how visually impaired people could grasp the game space and situation through sound to determine their next action.",

These tasks are completed by using tangible user interfaces, each with their intended purpose as they represent different kitchen utensils, workstations and plates. The chefs need to employ good communication skills and navigate through the chaotic playing area to earn the highest possible profits for their restaurant. This game was designed through the application of guidelines, advice and findings from articles in the field of Human Computer Interaction. By means of play tests the game was evaluated and further improved upon, providing both players and spectators an enjoyable experience.",

      "abstract": "coPlay: Big Purpose Dreaming Plays with Pop Culture Avatars is a workshop that shares our serious productive play research for rewiring the easily bored and overwhelmed brain; for some this is the ADHD brain, but for hyper digital natives as many are today, this is becoming a common non-ADHD struggle. \r\n\r\nThis workshop includes collaborative play methods intended for anyone struggling with overwhelm and the tendency to be easily bored. It is designed to be a fun and productive play space. The method is a result of a self-guided therapy and creative research practice into play as a modality for rewiring trauma triggered ADHD habits. The work is based on personal experience with ADHD, observational research on mass media cultures, and influenced by the host’s past work with Karen Barad’s(2007) agential realism theory of intra-action. Barad’s approach to sensemaking focuses on the way elements play off each other as agential entities that co-influence each other. It is a catalytical process that drives emergent knowledge and framing we prefer to draw on for the agency it places on each player in any real work or digital game play.\r\n\r\nThis methodology is part of a large project experimenting with a co-playing tool/game design, digital and analog, targeting two separate audiences: (i) mixed-age siblings learning to cooperate an empathize with each other and their immediate family for planetary care-based thinking, and (ii) high performing and goal oriented creatives with neurodiverse symptoms of ADHD. The method uses a co-play buddy system, a 2 person play, and a 4 person play to add complexity and perspective to the challenge set by each participant. In casual in-house trials, it has been useful for a type of ADHD that where the focusing on deeper work is affected, as is perspective to stay motivated and see beyond the immediate life situation the person find them in.",

The application of generative AI stands to augment a wide variety of research adjacent processes, such as brainstorming, text drafting, referencing, and editing technical documents. However, generative AI outputs are shaped by flawed models, and stand to proliferate inaccuracies in texts, images, and other generated media. Further, these models are typically trained on data that may not be ethically sourced. As the popularity of this technology grows, protocols (both official and unofficial) are being developed around how to manage the use of generative AI in academic spaces. It is imperative that the games and play research community join this important conversation, and discuss the appropriateness of using generative AI in both digital games, and our own academic works.",

      "abstract": "Due to the increasing availability and efficiency of digital technologies humanity has reached a point where digitally altering consciousness might become ubiquitous, echoing in all areas of the functioning of society. In addition to the already familiar functions in terms of conveying information, enabling experiences, and extending our realities, there is an emerging field of digitally-induced altered states of consciousness (DIAL). Precursors of the societal impact of DIAL technologies include various examples from binaural beats to video games that provide invaluable insights into forthcoming DIAL technologies. Although individual changes in consciousness through digital means have been studied for decades, they have been limited to the reach of technology. We suggest the field DIAL denotes the class of all digital technologies exploited for inducing altered states of consciousness (ASC). It supports a focused and holistic approach to anticipating futures and astute actions. We highlight the need for a detailed and full-fledged examination by demonstrating existing and hypothetical examples of their impact on Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal (PESTEL) contexts. Based on these reflections we outline a potential research agenda to elicit discussions within the interdisciplinary community.",

Designing these ``discovered transformational games'' yields different challenges and affordances than games developed for more formal contexts; however, the academic literature provides little guidance for these designers. I aim to analyse existing discovered transformational games --- as well as design my own --- in order to better understand the design process of these games.

However, its application to sensitive topics remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents the initial steps in designing a gamified educational platform with a specific focus on raising awareness about gender-based violence among young individuals. The paper outlines the design considerations undertaken for the platform’s development, drawing from theories in social psychology, education, and gamification. Through stakeholder interviews and engagement, important aspects of the platform's design were identified. The paper aims to a deeper understanding and utilization of gamification in addressing sensitive topics within education, fostering meaningful comprehension, empathy, and positive behavioral change among learners.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Many people play games to socialize. Previous studies have shown that asymmetric virtual reality (VR) games ---games that utilize and consider differences of various kinds--- can improve users' social and player experience. However, the impact of existing social factors on users' experiences is still unknown in asymmetric games. In this paper, we designed and implemented an asymmetric game in which both players are in VR. In the game, players had to exchange asymmetric information to complete tasks, resulting in a strategic interdependence. We studied how familiarity (friends vs. strangers) affects social and player experience, as well as game performance. In our preliminary between-participants study (N=14), we did not find significant differences between the friend and stranger teams in social and player experience, or game performance. We discuss how asymmetries can be used to create social VR games, and how and why familiarity does (not) affect the experience of players.",

Visitor interest in museums is flagging and as audiences’ values shift, so must museums’. While museums have increasingly adopted interactive technologies to engage visitors, these efforts have not yet fully realised museums’ potential in creating immersive and educational experiences that cater to the evolving expectations of modern audiences. My research will investigate how digital technologies can facilitate immersive museum game experiences. By examining the current state of technologically mediated interactive experiences in museums, and museums’ use of games more broadly, I aim to construct a design methodology for museum games.",

      "abstract": "In the era of \"Games-as-a-Service,\" a large number of game studios face the challenge of creating immersive virtual economies that offer enjoyable experiences for players. Evaluating game economies and sustaining their balance can be a complex and costly task, which often relies on human play-testers. To address this, our work explores the utilization of simulated AI players as a viable solution.\r\nThis Work in Progress article presents our preliminary analysis of fundamental entities that construct game economies and the variables of these entities that impact different aspects of player experience. The focus is on five basic economic entities: Currency Sources, Inventories, Converters, Currency Sinks, and Traders. By examining these entities and their defining factors, we determine their influence on player experience.\r\nSubsequently, we propose AI Agents that are capable of playing games with a variety of play styles and adjusting the mentioned variables, ultimately enhancing the player experience based on the developers' goals. This approach offers game developers a cost-effective means of evaluating and optimizing in-game economies, without having to spend excessive time and money on human testers. Our research contributes to the development of coherent virtual economies by providing fast and accurate feedback, reducing costs, and making economy balancing more accessible to indie developers.",

      "abstract": "Maldaimonia is a new experiential concept that refers to self-actualization and self-expression through egocentric, destructive, and/or exploitative activities. Still, it is unclear whether maldaimonia is an actual facet of real experience. As a subversive orientation, it may be rare or socially challenging to discuss openly. However, video games provide a space in which people can be expressive in different ways without the same repercussions as in real life. Indeed, game spaces may be one of the few contexts in which to study maldaimonic experiences. In this study, we examined whether and how maldaimonia exists as a feature of game user experiences by analyzing critical self-reports of gaming activities, confirming its existence. We contribute this new construct to work on \"dark play\" in games research.",

      "abstract": "Game content creation poses significant challenges, particularly for\r\nindie developers and small teams, as it presents difficulties in scaling\r\nto meet diverse player preferences. Adaptable procedural content\r\ngeneration (PCG) provides a promising solution to this issue. Extensive\r\nliterature exists on adaptable PCG techniques, encompassing\r\nboth offline (during development) and online (during gameplay)\r\napproaches. Building upon this foundation, we propose a novel\r\nextension called Player-Centric Procedural Content Generation\r\n(PCPCG) as an additional tool for creating unique game experiences\r\nbased on player preferences. In contrast to runtime adaptable\r\nPCG methods, which adapt or learn based solely on in-game data,\r\nPCPCG actively involves players in the learning loop by soliciting\r\ntheir feedback. Additionally, it shifts the focus from designers\r\n(as in mixed initiative (MI) and co-creative PCG) to the players as\r\nproviders of learning data, thus operating during gameplay rather\r\nthan during development. PCPCG possesses three key qualities: 1)\r\nreal-time operation during gameplay, 2) active participation of players\r\n(not designers) in the learning loop, and 3) online learning from\r\nplayer feedback to create engaging and personalized content. It is\r\nimportant to differentiate PCPCG from content creation aids and ingame\r\ndata adaptable PCGs. While PCPCG falls under the umbrella\r\nof adaptable PCG, it goes beyond relying solely on in-game data by\r\nincorporating valuable player feedback as a vital information source\r\nfor content generation. PCPCG introduces a novel and promising\r\napproach to runtime procedural content generation by leveraging\r\nplayer feedback to create adaptive and personalized game content.\r\nWhile our proof of concept demonstrates the viability of PCPCG\r\nin a Pac-Man domain, further research is required to explore its\r\nlimitations as the complexity of the possibility space increases.",

      "abstract": "The past few years have witnessed a remarkable advancement in the field of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), a technology capable of generating new content based on input prompts and existing knowledge. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way of human-computer co-creation. However, existing research on GenAI has primarily focused on technical aspects, and more research is needed from a design perspective, mainly through speculative and critical design. Therefore, this study aims to explore how GenAI would transform human-computer co-creation in the next 10 to 15 years by means of design fiction and playful critical design. The study will involve (co-)speculative workshops utilizing design fiction, followed by focus groups to gather insights. In addition, this research will examine the user experience issues of interacting with functional GenAI prototypes through playful critical design.",

      "abstract": "This doctoral consortium submission presents a research program investigating the transition to digital hybridisation in theatre, specifically focusing on passive and active modalities facilitated by game-engine technologies. By adopting a \"research through design\" methodology, three theatre productions are being hybridised in collaboration with Malthouse Theatre to explore the potential of hybridisation in theatre and its impact on the evolving landscape of digital experiences in the performing arts. Each production employs a pragmatist approach and Research through Design methodology, supplemented by participant studies, to comprehensively explore hybridisation design practices and evaluate their effectiveness. Although participant study results are pending, existing publications provide initial insights into the projects. The ultimate goal of this research is to contribute to the understanding of design processes and practices in digital hybridisation, thus advancing the field of contemporary theatre and digital experiences.\r\n",

      "abstract": "The input of free-form text is frequently utilized in surveys for game-related research. While this provides flexibility, it also presents the challenge of dirty data, which includes spelling errors, missing series titles, and unofficial yet popular abbreviations inputted by the user. The manual resolution of these anomalies is impractical and resource-intensive. To address this issue, a fuzzing string machine-based game mapping system was designed and evaluated using 1,096 game titles input by users. GMap-R, a real-time autocomplete game title system to aid runtime user entry, was also created and evaluated using 150 game titles provided by 30 participants, each of whom listed their five favorite games twice. With GMap-R, the correct mapping percentage increased to 98.67%. These preliminary evaluations indicate that the proposed strategy can significantly enhance the cleansing and input of game titles' free-form text. In turn, this helps to conserve resources when obtaining unsupervised data through online studies.",

      "abstract": "It is a common irony that game designers often feel they have fallen out of love with the playing of games; in fact, adults of every industry may feel they have no time for play at all. This talk “Work Healthy, Play Healthy” describes the playful philosophy and practices of a small but thriving independent games studio and its leadership. Drawing from twenty years of experience in the games industry, Tanya X. Short shows how regular indulgence in play and playfulness is not only essential to success and happiness, but a moral imperative and a necessary ingredient in human growth. Decrying the protestant work ethic explicitly, “Work Healthy, Play Healthy” outlines both personal and structural approaches to the pursuit of sustainable, lifelong productivity and happiness in the making of games. With this lens, as one example, the ‘fail fast’ directive of entrepreneurs becomes reinterpreted as a command to play, which always has permission to fail. Tanya X. Short emphasizes the psychological and nigh-spiritual benefits of self-directed play at every level, in all of her roles, from CEO to game designer to activist to mother. This talk provides tools for professionals of all stripes to create windows of workful play.",

      "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) games intensify storytelling experiences by letting players take the role of a character. However, in contrast to films, novels, or games, VR experiences often remain centered around one single character without using the potential of complex multiprotagonist plots. Our work engages in this critical topic by investigating the design of immersive and natural transitions between different characters. First, we conducted a scoping review to identify existing multiprotagonist VR games (N=18) and grouped their used transition techniques into four categories. Based on these findings and prior research, we designed two transition techniques (Static Map vs. Rebodying) and conducted a between-participants (N=36) study to explore their effect on user experience. Our results show that Rebodying outperforms Static Map regarding the perceived realism, acceptance, and spatial understanding of the character transitions. Both conditions do not differ significantly in terms of cybersickness. Finally, we provide future directions for developing, improving, and exploring of multiprotagonist transition techniques in VR games.",

      "abstract": "In first-person shooter (FPS) games, players often need to calculate the timing of their shots for moving targets in advance based on the speed and relative position of those targets. For most players, the accurate timing of shots requires extended gaming experience and training. Unlike professional players, hobby players have less time to compete and train, do not receive professional game guidance, and cannot afford expensive gaming devices. According to previous studies, wearable devices with electrical stimulation can effectively control the muscles with rapid reactions. Here, we provide a method for training the timing of gaming shooters using electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). We believe that training with EMS is feasible and effective, allowing players to quickly learn and improve their gaming experience. To test the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, we first tested the player's reaction time when using the EMS device to ensure that it did not have a negative impact on the player. Participants were then trained in a custom FPS game with three methods: EMS, non-EMS and EMS-only. The results showed a more significant increase in the average hit rate of EMS-trained participants compared to those trained using the other two methods. Thus, our study shows the possibility of using EMS devices as a training medium for a custom FPS game.",

      "abstract": "Kawaii is the Japanese concept of cute++, a global export with local characteristics. Recent work has explored kawaii as a feature of user experience (UX) with social robots, virtual characters, and voice assistants, i.e., kawaii vocalics. Games have a long history of incorporating characters that use voice as a means of expressing kawaii. Nevertheless, no work to date has evaluated kawaii game voices or mapped out a model of kawaii game vocalics. In this work, we explored whether and how a model of kawaii vocalics maps onto game character voices. We conducted an online perceptions study (N=157) using 18 voices from kawaii characters in Japanese games. We replicated the results for computer voice and discovered nuanced relationships between gender and age, especially youth fulness, agelessness, gender ambiguity, and gender neutrality. We provide our initial model and advocate for future work on character visuals and within play contexts.",

We present LEVI, a standalone adaptive board game system (ABGs) using RFID technology to adapt the gameplay experience for board games for players with or without visual impairment. As many hybrid board game systems often require costly resources (digital elements) which may not be accessible to the user, we considered low-cost alternatives to our solution. Given the various gameplay styles in board games, we mainly focus on audio adaptation for this game system. We present an evaluation of our current proof-of-concept game system and future possibilities of using our adaptive board game system.",

These emotions vary among players due to individual differences, ultimately shaping their\r\nemotional responses experienced by players during gameplay and exploring the correlation between player traits and behaviours. By utilising a turn-based strategy game, we employed a combination of self-report measures and behavioural observations to assess players’ emotional changes across varying game difficulty levels. Our results revealed that the hard game session elicited higher levels of arousal and negative emotion in players compared to the easy game session. Furthermore, we observed that players with a low extroversion tendency exhibited a higher inclination towards exploration behaviour in the game. This research provides initial insights into the complex interplay between player emotions, in-game behaviour and individual differences across game difficulties.\r\n",

      "abstract": "We demonstrate a game with a breathing control system designed to teach circular breathing, an advanced technique used by wind instrument players. Circular breathing allows players to produce continuous sound beyond the duration of a single breath by exhaling through the mouth while simultaneously inhaling through the nose. However, mastering this technique traditionally requires repetitive and often monotonous practice. To address this, we present a novel approach to skill acquisition that leverages gameplay with our breath control system, Fulow. Fulow uniquely controls the user's exhalation involuntarily through facial vibrations, eliminating the need for users to consciously control their exhalation. This innovative feature allows users to effortlessly perform circular breathing. Interaction with Fulow through our designed breathing games is expected to facilitate easy and enjoyable learning of circular breathing, demonstrating the potential of human augmentation technologies as novel game controllers for skill acquisition through gameplay.",

      "abstract": "We present three game demos built using our game streaming system, MARS (Metadata Augmented Real-time Streaming). Current streaming interfaces fall short of providing viewer interaction mechanisms beyond the chat channel. Additionally, personalized interaction, where viewers can independently interact with the game content being streamed, is not widely supported. We used MARS to render real-time metadata from the game being streamed onto an overlay that viewers can interact with. In building MARS, we enabled the creation of novel viewing experiences and established a design space that needs to be explored further. We created three demo games to showcase MARS' capabilities; a tower defense game with contextual information available for viewers, a visual novel with accessibility features enabled, and an asymmetric cooperative game requiring the streamer and viewers to work together. The focus of this paper is on motivating our design decisions for the demos and what potential they hold for playful experiences in live streaming. To this end, we use three games as probes into this yet unexplored design space, with the end-goal of creating novel stream experiences using the MARS system.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) games intensify storytelling experiences by letting players take the role of a character. However, in contrast to films, novels, or games, VR experiences often remain centered around one single character without using the potential of complex multiprotagonist plots. Our work engages in this critical topic by investigating the design of immersive and natural transitions between different characters. First, we conducted a scoping review to identify existing multiprotagonist VR games (N=18) and grouped their used transition techniques into four categories. Based on these findings and prior research, we designed two transition techniques (Static Map vs. Rebodying) and conducted a between-participants (N=36) study to explore their effect on user experience. Our results show that Rebodying outperforms Static Map regarding the perceived realism, acceptance, and spatial understanding of the character transitions. Both conditions do not differ significantly in terms of cybersickness. Finally, we provide future directions for developing, improving, and exploring of multiprotagonist transition techniques in VR games.",

      "abstract": "In first-person shooter (FPS) games, players often need to calculate the timing of their shots for moving targets in advance based on the speed and relative position of those targets. For most players, the accurate timing of shots requires extended gaming experience and training. Unlike professional players, hobby players have less time to compete and train, do not receive professional game guidance, and cannot afford expensive gaming devices. According to previous studies, wearable devices with electrical stimulation can effectively control the muscles with rapid reactions. Here, we provide a method for training the timing of gaming shooters using electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). We believe that training with EMS is feasible and effective, allowing players to quickly learn and improve their gaming experience. To test the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, we first tested the player's reaction time when using the EMS device to ensure that it did not have a negative impact on the player. Participants were then trained in a custom FPS game with three methods: EMS, non-EMS and EMS-only. The results showed a more significant increase in the average hit rate of EMS-trained participants compared to those trained using the other two methods. Thus, our study shows the possibility of using EMS devices as a training medium for a custom FPS game.",

      "abstract": "Computer Mediation Communication (CMC) applications are utilized to foster closer relationships between individuals. Various shared experience strategy designs were widely applied to technologies in order to enhance communications and interactions in family relationships. However, there needs to be more research on how shared experience approaches work in different family communication patterns. This paper presents insights into the effectiveness of three types of shared experience approaches for different family communication patterns and design considerations for game design from a diary study of Chatterbox Opener, the game we developed for families and couples to enhance communication orientation.",

      "abstract": "Player emotion is a crucial aspect of the video game experience, as games employ interactive environments that elicit a diverse range of both negative and positive emotions. These emotions vary among players due to individual differences, ultimately shaping their\r\nemotional responses experienced by players during gameplay and exploring the correlation between player traits and behaviours. By utilising a turn-based strategy game, we employed a combination of self-report measures and behavioural observations to assess players’ emotional changes across varying game difficulty levels. Our results revealed that the hard game session elicited higher levels of arousal and negative emotion in players compared to the easy game session. Furthermore, we observed that players with a low extroversion tendency exhibited a higher inclination towards exploration behaviour in the game. This research provides initial insights into the complex interplay between player emotions, in-game behaviour and individual differences across game difficulties.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Kawaii is the Japanese concept of cute++, a global export with local characteristics. Recent work has explored kawaii as a feature of user experience (UX) with social robots, virtual characters, and voice assistants, i.e., kawaii vocalics. Games have a long history of incorporating characters that use voice as a means of expressing kawaii. Nevertheless, no work to date has evaluated kawaii game voices or mapped out a model of kawaii game vocalics. In this work, we explored whether and how a model of kawaii vocalics maps onto game character voices. We conducted an online perceptions study (N=157) using 18 voices from kawaii characters in Japanese games. We replicated the results for computer voice and discovered nuanced relationships between gender and age, especially youth fulness, agelessness, gender ambiguity, and gender neutrality. We provide our initial model and advocate for future work on character visuals and within play contexts.",

We present LEVI, a standalone adaptive board game system (ABGs) using RFID technology to adapt the gameplay experience for board games for players with or without visual impairment. As many hybrid board game systems often require costly resources (digital elements) which may not be accessible to the user, we considered low-cost alternatives to our solution. Given the various gameplay styles in board games, we mainly focus on audio adaptation for this game system. We present an evaluation of our current proof-of-concept game system and future possibilities of using our adaptive board game system.",

Marker-based AR is widely used because of being low cost and ease of integration, but the gameful aspect of manipulating the physical AR markers remains understudied. In this paper, we explored the stacking mechanics of transparent AR markers and described the creation of an AR music game called Stackable Music. Stackable Music can be developed, assembled, and set up at home or office with a printer with several sheets of transparent film and a PC or mobile device with a camera.",

      "abstract": "Climate change poses a serious threat to human well-being and life on Earth. To avoid global warming's worst consequences every effort is needed, which requires cognitively, affectively and behaviorally engaging of as many of us as possible. However, climate change engagement is far from easy or simple, with manifold personal and contextual variables affecting our connection with the issue. Because of this, games and gamification have been proposed as visual, interactive, and motivating methods to support people in their engagement journey. Despite dozens of climate change-relevant digital games existing, some configurations are under-explored, including messaging frames such as health, engagement dimensions beyond knowledge, technologies such as immersive virtual reality (VR), and controlled experimental research methods. In this article, we present Climate Connected: Outbreak, a story-based single-player game for immersive VR and traditional computer screens that approaches climate change as a planetary health and well-being issue and supports players in their affective and behavioral connection to it. The game takes place in 2050 and connects day-to-day objects with systemic issues. Two versions can be played, one featuring an unnamed distant place and the other located in Tampere, Finland. The game has been used in research and has led to nuanced understandings of the players' experience, as well as learning, attitude, and self-efficacy gains.",

      "abstract": "Asymmetric games create unique and engaging player experiences that can draw together players from multiple demographics.But maintaining a strong level of interaction between different player roles poses a challenge, which is exacerbated in competitive games. This paper seeks to find solutions to this problem in the context of RaceTrap, a competitive asymmetric racing game. RaceTrap combines card-playing and racing elements, where one player uses cards to create obstacles and the other tries to avoid these obstacles while driving in Virtual Reality. We address the central challenge of coupling, or maintaining a high level of awareness and interaction between the roles. The paper reviews existing approaches to coupling in asymmetric cooperative games, and highlights the needs for an improved coupling in competitive asymmetric games. We present features implemented in RaceTrap to improve coupling. These solutions highlight the importance of coupling in the emerging field of asymmetric games.",

      "abstract": "Playtime holds great significance in the holistic development of children and young teens, both physically and mentally. Engaging with physical toys and participating in outdoor sports fosters essential skills such as spatial interaction, socialization, and communication in the real world. However, contemporary entertainment that targets young people is predominantly screen-based media, offering simulated worlds, captivating narratives, and interactive experiences. Consequently, children and teens spend substantial amounts of time indoors, preoccupied with online activities and digital content consumption. This paradigm shift towards digital entertainment poses developmental challenges due to the absence of tangibility and face-to-face interaction. This paper introduces Memeopoly, a novel AI-powered physical board game that synergies the strengths of tangible playtime with the dynamism and interactivity of the digital realm. Integrating AI technology into the traditional play framework augments the interactive nature of physical toys, enabling a richer and more engaging game-play environment. We designed our AI system in the game to harness and empower human creativity to generate unforeseen story lines personalized to players' unique preferences, thereby cultivating a thrilling gaming experience that surpasses the static and generic narratives typically found in traditional board games.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents \"The Sea is a Sky,\" an immersive virtual reality (VR) poetry experience that takes inspiration from the Cuban poem \"Del Otro Lado Del Mar,\" which translates to \"on the other side of the sea.\" In this VR game, players are transported into the journey of a Cuban immigrant as they leave their homeland in search of a better future in America. Through physical actions such as crawling, swimming, and rowing within the VR environment, players embody the struggles and challenges faced by the immigrant protagonist. Throughout the experience, they encounter visionary hallucinations and hear messages of hope for the future as they navigate the vast ocean. However, the game also highlights the tragic reality of many Cuban immigrants who have lost their lives while attempting to cross the treacherous sea. The theme of drowning serves as a poignant symbol of their plight. The development of \"The Sea is a Sky\" involved collaboration among students from diverse disciplines, including English Literature, Computer Science, and Digital Arts. The project aims to achieve two primary objectives: raising awareness about social issues related to refugees and immigrants, and pushing the boundaries of game design by creating an engaging experience for younger generations to connect with poetry through the medium of virtual reality. While poetry has the inherent power to evoke deep reflection, it often struggles to resonate with younger individuals in its traditional forms. By harnessing the potential of virtual reality, our project seeks to expand the horizons of traditional poetry and explore innovative ways of experiencing it in the digital realm. The design and implementation of our VR experience not only offer a unique and engaging approach to poetry but also have the potential to inform future applications of VR in digital poetry and the cultivation of empathy among audiences.",

In this moderated panel, both AAA and industry developers talk about and answer questions about the serendipitous ways they entered games, what life inside their studios looks like, how the landscape for gamemaking careers has changed in the past 5 years, and where academia can fit in. Conversation topics can range from what life is like in an employee-driven co-operative, to how HCI researchers can make the leap from academia to AAA studio GUR, to everything in between.",

However, they also draw the player’s focus away from the body as the output occurs on visual displays, creating a divide between the physical body and the virtual world. We propose a novel approach – the \"Body as a Play Material\" – where a player uses their body as both input and output to unify the physical body and the virtual world. To showcase this approach, we designed three games where a player uses one of their hands (input) to play against the other hand (output) by loaning control over its movements to an Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) system. We conducted a thematic analysis on the data obtained from a field study with 12 participants to articulate four player experience themes. We discuss our results about how participants appreciated the engagement with the variety of bodily movements for play and the ambiguity of using their body as a play material. Ultimately, our work aims to unify the physical body and the virtual world.",

To blur the boundaries between spectators and players, we propose a novel approach called ``Fused Spectatorship'', where spectators watch their hands play games by loaning bodily control to a computational Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) system. To showcase this concept, we designed three games where spectators loan control over both their hands to the EMS system and watch them play these competitive and collaborative games. A study with 12 participants suggested that participants could not distinguish if they were watching their hands play, or if they were playing the games themselves.  We used our results to articulate four spectator experience themes and four fused spectator types, the behaviours they elicited and offer one design consideration to support each of these behaviours. We also discuss the ethical design considerations of our approach to help game designers create future fused spectatorship experiences.",

      "abstract": "Most digital bodily games focus on the body as they use movement as input. However, they also draw the player’s focus away from the body as the output occurs on visual displays, creating a divide between the physical body and the virtual world. We propose a novel approach – the \"Body as a Play Material\" – where a player uses their body as both input and output to unify the physical body and the virtual world. To showcase this approach, we designed three games where a player uses one of their hands (input) to play against the other hand (output) by loaning control over its movements to an Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) system. We conducted a thematic analysis on the data obtained from a field study with 12 participants to articulate four player experience themes. We discuss our results about how participants appreciated the engagement with the variety of bodily movements for play and the ambiguity of using their body as a play material. Ultimately, our work aims to unify the physical body and the virtual world.",

To blur the boundaries between spectators and players, we propose a novel approach called ``Fused Spectatorship'', where spectators watch their hands play games by loaning bodily control to a computational Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) system. To showcase this concept, we designed three games where spectators loan control over both their hands to the EMS system and watch them play these competitive and collaborative games. A study with 12 participants suggested that participants could not distinguish if they were watching their hands play, or if they were playing the games themselves.

We also discuss the ethical design considerations of our approach to help game designers create future fused spectatorship experiences.",

      "abstract": "This research project aims to design and develop video games for studying and improving collaboration and collaboration skills. To this end, we reviewed the scientific literature across many disciplines, including psychology, computer science, and game theory. This literature review led to key insights and an attempt to develop a framework grounded in Reinforcement Learning Theory with the ambition of integrating a diversity of disparate scientific results but also to provide a lens through which to study existing multiplayer games as well as drive the development of research video games for studying and improving collaboration and collaboration skills. We will review commercial multiplayer games to identify key concepts and mechanics that game designers use for engaging collaborative gameplay. We will then develop game prototypes based on both our theoretical framework and our video game reviews and conduct small-scale user tests to help us identify the most promising ideas and to iteratively update the framework and game design for future  large-scale experimental studies. Here we present key ideas behind this project; it is still in its early stages and could greatly benefit from discussions with the CHI-Play community.",

      "abstract": "Due to the increasing availability and efficiency of digital technologies humanity has reached a point where digitally altering consciousness might become ubiquitous, echoing in all areas of the functioning of society. In addition to the already familiar functions in terms of conveying information, enabling experiences, and extending our realities, there is an emerging field of digitally-induced altered states of consciousness (DIAL). Precursors of the societal impact of DIAL technologies include various examples from binaural beats to video games that provide invaluable insights into forthcoming DIAL technologies. Although individual changes in consciousness through digital means have been studied for decades, they have been limited to the reach of technology. We suggest the field DIAL denotes the class of all digital technologies exploited for inducing altered states of consciousness (ASC). It supports a focused and holistic approach to anticipating futures and astute actions. We highlight the need for a detailed and full-fledged examination by demonstrating existing and hypothetical examples of their impact on Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal (PESTEL) contexts. Based on these reflections we outline a potential research agenda to elicit discussions within the interdisciplinary community.",

      "abstract": "In the era of \"Games-as-a-Service,\" a large number of game studios face the challenge of creating immersive virtual economies that offer enjoyable experiences for players. Evaluating game economies and sustaining their balance can be a complex and costly task, which often relies on human play-testers. To address this, our work explores the utilization of simulated AI players as a viable solution.\r\nThis Work in Progress article presents our preliminary analysis of fundamental entities that construct game economies and the variables of these entities that impact different aspects of player experience. The focus is on five basic economic entities: Currency Sources, Inventories, Converters, Currency Sinks, and Traders. By examining these entities and their defining factors, we determine their influence on player experience.\r\nSubsequently, we propose AI Agents that are capable of playing games with a variety of play styles and adjusting the mentioned variables, ultimately enhancing the player experience based on the developers' goals. This approach offers game developers a cost-effective means of evaluating and optimizing in-game economies, without having to spend excessive time and money on human testers. Our research contributes to the development of coherent virtual economies by providing fast and accurate feedback, reducing costs, and making economy balancing more accessible to indie developers.",
