      "abstract": "Maker culture emphasizes informal, networked, self- and peer-led learning, motivated by fun and self-fulfillment, and learning through mistakes. However, studies often describe activities involving a lot of guidance. As guidance may lead to both the process and outcomes influenced by those guiding the activity, it is also important to examine how projects evolve without the supporters push. We take a nexus analytical approach to explore 1) how teens� background, interactions with others, and available materials and spaces are at play when they shape their ideas and outputs in a collaborative maker project with minimal support, and 2) how these factors can be considered to better support learning in such projects. The work carried out by five teens in a local FabLab was based on peer collaboration within changing apprentice mentor pairs. When they ideated and prototyped for a future school, researchers provided minimal support, mainly online. Without their push, teens quickly modified tasks which both guided and narrowed down their thinking. Their experiences from school environment and the FabLab space served as an inspiration as they designed solutions to overcome current problems in the current school setting or digital fabrication process. When making, they gravitated towards processes they had previous experience of or which they enjoyed, perhaps partly affected by the competing discourses of maker culture and expertise we observed to be present in the FabLab space. While building on existing skillsets, this may leave the potential of novel trajectories and expanding one�s skills and competences unexplored. Teens� self-esteem improved as they turned from apprentices to mentors for their peers. This allowed them to process their learning from a different perspective. In general, our results paint a detailed picture of the roles of different participants in a maker project and provide an example of how familiar discourses of education persist in teens� designs. Looking at the project through the lens of Nexus analysis contributes to an increased understanding of the space for action and participants� histories, and interactions on the process, valuable for researchers studying DF and making, and practitioners working in makerspaces and FabLabs with different user groups. On a more practical level, our work contributes to a deeper understanding on how to include teens into non-guided and community-driven maker practices. We provide practical implications on how to support learning in collaborative making projects in informal learning situations, and regarding the role of the different actors and the environment in such situations. We also identify avenues for future research in this area.",

      "abstract": "The debate on whether social media has a net positive or negative effect on youth is ongoing. Therefore, we conducted a thematic analysis on 2,061 posts made by 1,038 adolescents aged 15-17 on an online peer-support platform to investigate the ways in which these teens discussed popular social media platforms in their posts and to identify differences in their experiences across platforms. Our findings revealed four main emergent themes for the ways in which social media was discussed: 1) Sharing negative experiences or outcomes of social media use (58%, n = 1,095), 2) Attempts to connect with others (45%, n = 922), 3) Highlighting the positive side of social media use (20%, n = 409), and 4) Seeking information (20%, n = 491). Overall, while sharing about negative experiences was more prominent, teens also discussed balanced perspectives of connection-seeking, positive experiences, and information support on social media that should not be discounted. Moreover, we found statistical significance for how these experiences differed across social media platforms. For instance, teens were most likely to seek romantic relationships on Snapchat and self-promote on YouTube. Meanwhile, Instagram was mentioned most frequently for body shaming, and Facebook was the most commonly discussed platform for privacy violations (mostly from parents). The key takeaway from our study is that the benefits and drawbacks of teens’ social media usage can co-exist and net effects (positive or negative) can vary across different teens across various contexts. As such, we advocate for mitigating the negative experiences and outcomes of social media use as voiced by teens, to improve, rather than limit or restrict, their overall social media experience. We do this by taking an affordance perspective that aims to promote the digital well-being and online safety of youth “by design.”",

Understanding how teenagers interact with these videos, their subsequent actions, and the resulting impact on their food practices and eating habits have the potential to provide insight into their broader lifestyle choices and their interactions within their social circles, including parents, friends, and other people online. By examining how teenagers use TikTok food videos online and offline, we gain a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between social media, teenage lifestyle, and social dynamics surrounding food practices. \n\nIn this research, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with teenagers aged 13 to 19, investigating their consumption of TikTok food videos and the actions inspired by them. By examining the multifaceted influence of TikTok food videos from a temporal perspective, this study contributes to the reflections of teens' use of TikTok food videos and their inspired food practices in the short and long term, online and offline. We propose design and theoretical implications to support teenagers' health. These insights have the potential to extend to various contexts that help educators, policymakers, and designers in fostering healthy lifestyles among teenagers.",

      "abstract": "Educational live streaming has become a complement to in-person teaching. While synchronous instructor-learner communication is useful, the technology-mediated nature of live streaming can obscure many interaction cues (e.g., learners’ facial expressions and body language), which dampens the instructors’ ability to respond to remote learners’ needs. We explore the opportunity of leveraging real-time transcripts generated from instructors’ audio as a basis for re-creating interaction cues. Transcripts can be leveraged to reveal the content of live streams in a form that learners can trace back and annotate, and such annotations can be further aggregated and presented to instructors as signals to assist them in tracking learners’ engagement. By designing and evaluating our proof-of-concept prototype system, EduLive, we show that instructors benefited from the summative information extracted from learners’ annotations, and the context provided by the transcript enhanced their ability to answer learners’ questions. Our system contributes to the design space of social annotations in CSCW by employing social annotations in educational live streaming scenarios.",

The compelling aspect of effective narrative visualization consequentially results in the potential to shift the attitude of an audience. However, there is much to understand about how narrative visualization can best be designed to influence target audiences. This paper focuses on an empirical experiment where we examined the effects of two communication strategies - anthropomorphism and personal identification - on a young adult audience. In particular, we wanted to understand which strategy, when integrated into narrative visualization, can nudge a specific audience’s attitude towards greater consideration in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results indicated that the personal identification communication strategy was the most successful in nudging participants. This study contributes a better grasp of how technologies such as narrative visualization, using different communication strategies, can deliver more targeted messaging.",

      "abstract": "Despite the promises of ML in education, its adoption in the classroom has surfaced numerous issues regarding fairness, accountability, and transparency, as well as concerns about data privacy and student consent. A root cause of these issues is the lack of understanding of the complex dynamics of education, including teacher-student interactions, collaborative learning, and classroom environment. To overcome these challenges and fully utilize the potential of ML in education, software practitioners need to work closely with educators and students to fully understand the context of the data (the backbone of ML applications) and collaboratively define the ML data specifications. To gain a deeper understanding of such a collaborative process, we conduct ten co-design sessions with ML software practitioners, educators, and students. In the sessions, teachers and students work with ML engineers, UX designers, and legal practitioners to define dataset characteristics for a given ML application. We find that stakeholders contextualize data based on their domain and procedural knowledge, proactively design data requirements to mitigate downstream harms and data reliability concerns, and exhibit role-based collaborative strategies and contribution patterns. Further, we find that beyond a seat at the table, meaningful stakeholder participation in ML requires structured supports: defined processes for continuous iteration and co-evaluation, shared contextual data quality standards, and information scaffolds for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to traverse expertise boundaries.",

Our formative study involved 20 participants who utilized an existing application, providing insights into their preferences for organizing expressions of gratitude and the significance of prompts for reflection and mood labeling after working hours. Building on these findings, we conducted a deployment study with 26 participants using our custom-designed application, which confirmed the positive impact of structured options to guide gratitude practice and highlighted the advantages of passive engagement with the application during busy periods.

      "abstract": "Many digital platforms pit consumers or customers and service workers against one another or render human work invisible, concealing human labor for profit and the charismatic allure of automation. When schooling - a domain traditionally enmeshed in tension between standardization and care - is digitized, what transformations occur to the relationships between teachers, parents, and students, and with what consequences? Despite platform mediation obscuring pre-existing avenues of connection, teachers develop alternative strategies to practice caring responsiveness with students in online environments of low visibility through a process I call ``distributed attunement.'' These strategies entail proactively working to build holistic relationships with students, collaborating with family members and fellow teachers, and making use of passively collected platform data and actively stitched together social information to interpret student experiences. Rather than giving in to digitization as a vehicle for removing or obscuring care work, teachers persist in centering relationships as core to the virtual school experience. The forms of distributed attunement teachers in virtual schools create illustrate the impossibility of separating technical and affective labor in a pedagogical context and provide promising sites for advocates of high-quality educational experiences to develop supports. Further, teachers’ navigation of limited visibility suggests tactics for CSCW researchers concerned with documenting invisible labor in the development of digital systems. Nevertheless, these strategies can be appropriated or undermined by employers in ways that threaten to diminish their efficacy, requiring ongoing advocacy to push for flourishing online schooling options.",

However, most nudging interventions to date have not been designed to cater to teens� unique needs and online safety concerns. To address this gap, this study provided a comprehensive view of adolescents� feedback on online safety nudges to inform the design of more effective online safety interventions. We conducted 12 semi-structured interviews and 3 focus group sessions with 21 teens (13 � 17 years old) \\edit{via Zoom} to get their feedback on three types of nudge designs from two opposing perspectives (i.e., risk victim and perpetrator) and for two different online risks (i.e., Information Breaches and Cyberbullying). Based on the teens' responses, they expressed a desire that nudges need to move beyond solely warning the user to providing a clear and effective action to take in response to the risk. They also identified key differences that affect the perception of nudges in effectively addressing an online risk, they include age, risk medium, risk awareness, and perceived risk severity. Finally, the teens identified several challenges with nudges such as them being easy to ignore, disruptive, untimely, and possibly escalating the risk. To address these, teens recommended clearer and contextualized warnings, risk prevention, and nudge personalization as solutions to ensure effective nudging. Overall, we recommend online safety nudges be designed for victim guidance while providing autonomy to control their experiences, and to ensure accountability and prevention of risk perpetrators to restrict them from causing harm.",

This long-standing education gap persists, although educational technologies have greatly facilitated access to learning materials. In this paper, we propose and explore a new pedagogical approach, CRAYON in which a pool of non-professional tutors take turns meeting and teaching rural children remotely in micro-sessions, which we refer to as short-relay sessions. As such, CRAYON provides a critical component of learning, as suggested by Sociocultural theory, that is lacking in the rural areas in South Korea: social interaction with a more knowledgeable other (MKO). To understand how a child and a newly-met tutor interact within the proposed setting, we conducted a short relay session-based English learning program for 5 rural children for 4 weeks in South Korea with 15 tutors. Our analysis of session recordings, interviews, and usage logs revealed a rich body of findings indicating the feasibility of short-relay session-based learning.",

      "abstract": "Online search and brokering (OSB) is the phenomenon in which youth search for information for their immigrant families on the Internet. Few studies exist on reflecting on the past as youth conduct OSB from childhood to adolescence to young adulthood. We conducted a retrospective study using semi-structured interviews of 27 young adults (ages 19 - 24) to examine their experience and perceptions of OSB over time (primary schooling, secondary schooling, undergraduate). We found that although all the interviewees shared a common experience of being an online searcher and information broker for their immigrant families, their stories exist on various dimensions which are constantly shifting and changing over time, as ecological factors influence searching behaviors. We discuss how the results from our study can serve as future references for researchers doing work in search research and designers who are currently working on improving design tools for searching.",

      "abstract": "Radios are essential for the operations of modern police departments, and they function as both a collaborative communication technology and a sociotechnical system. However, little prior research has examined their usage or their connections to individual privacy and the role of race in policing, two growing topics of concern in the US. As a case study, we examine the Chicago Police Department's (CPD's) use of broadcast police communications (BPC) to coordinate the activity of law enforcement officers (LEOs) in the city. From a recently assembled archive of $80,775$ hours of BPC associated with CPD operations, we analyze human-generated text transcripts of radio transmissions broadcast 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on August 10th, 2018 in one majority Black, one majority white, and one majority Hispanic area of the city (24 hours of audio) to explore three research questions: (1) Do BPC reflect reported racial disparities in policing? (2) How and when is gender, race/ethnicity, and age mentioned in BPC? (3) To what extent does BPC include sensitive information, and who is put at most risk by this practice? (4) To what extent can large language models (LLMs) heighten this risk? We explore the vocabulary and speech acts used by police in BPC, comparing mentions of personal characteristics to local demographics, the personal information shared over BPC, and the privacy concerns that it poses. Analysis indicates (a) policing professionals in the City of Chicago exhibit disproportionate attention to Black members of the public regardless of context, (b) sociodemographic characteristics like gender, race/ethnicity, and age are primarily mentioned in BPC about event information, and (c) disproportionate attention introduces disproportionate privacy risks for Black members of the public. This study shows BPC can provide a novel window into disproportionate attention (i.e., via radio communications) by law enforcement officers to specific racial groups, leading to increased privacy vulnerability for those groups, particularly Black males.",

There are, however, several challenges to explainable AI, one of which is the generation and selection of explanations from the causal history of a given event. Causal attribution, among other cognitive processes, has been found to be influenced by socio-cultural factors, which suggests that there could be systematic differences in preferences for AI explanations between communities of users according to their cognitive style and socio-cultural characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between preferences in the explanations provided by belief-desire-intention AI agents,  cognitive style (holistic vs analytical), and socio-cultural factors, such as gender, education, social class, and political and religious beliefs. We found a relationship between explanation preference, cognitive style and various socio-cultural characteristics. Holistic cognitive style is associated with preference for goal explanations while analytic cognitive style is associated with preference for belief explanations. Socio-cultural variables that affect explanation preference are gender, religious beliefs, educational attainment, some fields of education, and political party affiliation.",

Existing models for LMS adoption are often qualitative, learner-centered, and difficult to leverage towards institutional support. We propose depth-of-use (DOU): an intuitive measurement model for faculty's utilization of a university-wide LMS and their needs for institutional support. We hypothesis-test the relationship between DOU and course attributes like modality, participation, logistics, and outcomes. In a large-scale analysis of metadata from 30000+ courses offered at [INSTITUTION] over two years, we find that a pervasive need for scale, interoperability and ubiquitous access drives LMS adoption by university instructors. We then demonstrate how DOU can help faculty members identify the opportunity-cost of transition from legacy apps to LMS tools. We also describe how DOU can help instructional designers and IT organizational leadership evaluate the impact of their support allocation, faculty development and LMS evangelism initiatives.",

This paper examines how CHWs in rural India engage with and perceive AI explanations and how we might design explainable AI (XAI) interfaces that are more understandable to them. We conducted semi-structured interviews with CHWs who interacted with a design probe to predict neonatal jaundice in which AI recommendations are accompanied by explanations. We (1) identify how CHWs interpreted AI predictions and the associated explanations, (2) unpack the benefits and pitfalls they perceived of the explanations, and (3) detail how different design elements of the explanations impacted their AI understanding. Our findings demonstrate that while CHWs struggled to understand the AI explanations, they nevertheless expressed a strong preference for the explanations to be integrated into AI-driven tools and perceived several benefits of the explanations, such as helping CHWs learn new skills and improved patient trust in AI tools and in CHWs. We conclude by discussing what elements of AI need to be made explainable to novice AI users like CHWs and outlining concrete design recommendations to improve the utility of XAI for novice AI users in non-Western contexts.",

      "abstract": "As public sector agencies rapidly introduce new AI tools in high-stakes domains like social services, it becomes critical to understand how decisions to adopt these tools are made in practice. We borrow from the anthropological practice to ``study up'' those in positions of power, and reorient our study of public sector AI around those who have the power and responsibility to make decisions about the role that AI tools will play in their agency. Through semi-structured interviews and design activities with 16 agency decision-makers, we examine how decisions about AI design and adoption are influenced by their interactions with and assumptions about other actors within these agencies (e.g., frontline workers and agency leaders), as well as those above (legal systems and contracted companies), and below (impacted communities). By centering these networks of power relations, our findings shed light on how infrastructural, legal, and social factors create barriers and disincentives to the involvement of a broader range of stakeholders in decisions about AI design and adoption. Agency decision-makers desired more practical support for stakeholder involvement around public sector AI to help overcome the knowledge and power differentials they perceived between them and other stakeholders (e.g., frontline workers and impacted community members). Building on these findings, we discuss implications for future research and policy around actualizing participatory AI approaches in public sector contexts.",

      "abstract": "Public sectors aim to innovate not just for efficiency but also to enhance equity. Despite the growing adoption of data-driven decision-making systems in the public sector, efforts to integrate equity as a primary goal often fall short. This typically arises from inadequate early-stage involvement of the underserved stakeholders and prevalent misunderstandings concerning the authentic meaning of equity from these stakeholders' perspectives. Our research seeks to address this gap by actively involving undersevered stakeholders in the process of envisioning the integration of equity within public sector data-driven decisions, particularly in the context of a building department in a Northeastern mid-sized U.S. city. Applying a speed dating method with storyboards, we explore diverse equity-centric futures within the realm of local business development, a domain where small businesses, particularly women- and minority-owned businesses, historically confront inequitable distribution of public services. We explored three essential aspects of equity: monitoring equity, resource allocation prioritization, as well as information and equity. Our findings illuminate the complexities of integrating equity into data-driven decisions, offering nuanced insights about the needs of stakeholders. We found that attempts to monitor and incorporate equity goals into public sector decision-making can unexpectedly backfire, inadvertently sparking community apprehension and potentially exacerbating existing inequities. Small business owners, including those identifying as women- and minority-owned, advocated against the use of demographic-based data in equity-focused data-driven decision-making in the public sector, instead emphasizing factors like community needs, application complexity, and inherent small business uncertainties. Drawing from these insights, we propose design implications to assist designers of public sector data-driven decision-making systems better accommodate equity considerations.",

      "abstract": "Data generated by users on digital platforms are a crucial resource for advocates and researchers interested in uncovering digital inequities, auditing algorithms, and understanding human behavior. Yet data access is often restricted. How can researchers both effectively and ethically collect user data? This paper shares an innovative approach to crowdsourcing user data to collect otherwise inaccessible Amazon purchase histories, spanning 5 years, from more than 5,000 U.S. users. We developed a data collection tool that prioritizes participant consent and includes an experimental study design. The design allows us to study multiple important aspects of privacy perception and user data sharing behavior, including how socio-demographics, monetary incentives and transparency can impact share rates. Experiment results (N=6,325) reveal both monetary incentives and transparency can significantly increase data sharing. Age, race, education, and gender also played a role, where female and less-educated participants were more likely to share. Our study design enables a unique empirical evaluation of the “privacy paradox”, where users claim to value their privacy more than they do in practice. We set up both real and hypothetical data sharing scenarios and find measurable similarities and differences in share rates across these contexts. For example, increasing monetary incentives had a 6 times higher impact on share rates in real scenarios. In addition, we study participants’ opinions on how data should be used by various third parties, again finding that gender, age, education, and race have a significant impact. Notably, the majority of participants disapproved of government agencies using purchase data yet the majority approved of use by researchers. Overall, our findings highlight the critical role that transparency, incentive design, and user demographics play in ethical data collection practices, and provide guidance for future researchers seeking to crowdsource user generated data.",

It, thus, becomes imperative to critically examine the politics, dynamics, and rhetoric of participation in development contexts. We deconstruct the meaning, means, and need for participation by situating our study in the Indian government's growing efforts to digitalize a nationwide scheme implemented to support rural farmers' participation in natural resource management (NRM) to achieve secure employment while building climate change resilience. Capturing the situated essence through field studies that include observations, interviews, and focus groups, we systematically analyze challenges to participation in NRM and uncover the technological gaps affecting its workflow digitalization. We discuss sociotechnical considerations to meaningfully design and integrate digital technologies toward supporting just and participatory futures of work in development contexts.",

Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue, with increasing research exploring their educational utility. However, the challenge lies not only in establishing the efficacy of LLMs but also in discerning the nuances of interaction between learners and these models, which impact learners' engagement and results. We conducted a formative study in an undergraduate computer science classroom (N=145) and a controlled experiment on Prolific (N=356) to explore the impact of four pedagogically informed guidance strategies on the learners' performance, confidence and trust in LLMs. Direct LLM answers marginally improved performance, while refining student solutions fostered trust. Structured guidance reduced random queries as well as instances of students copy-pasting assignment questions to the LLM. Our work highlights the role that teachers can play in shaping LLM-supported learning environments.",

      "abstract": "Data infrastructures are major sites through which city government operates and therefore of special interest to critical scholars of technology. Yet ways that these infrastructures are embedded into the institutional fabric of government make them difficult to navigate and often resistant to abstract critique and generalized analysis. We present an ethnographic study of a design effort launched by a team inside a city government to build and deploy a tool with a specific focus on equity and justice. By integrating data from multiple sources and bringing it together in a spatial framework, the team sought to bring neighborhood voices, often marginalized in planning efforts, into the center of the conversation. Tracing the negotiations over data's value in this process, we unveil various tensions involved in this effort, within and between different groups, and how the group of city employees navigated these tensions, mainly by adjusting the relations of the groups around data -- which we call \"data relations.\" Narratives in organizational communications were key in both revealing and mobilizing the data relations constituting the institutional data infrastructure. With the empirical findings, we argue that tracing the data relations can be an effective way for the CSCW community to understand the institutional data politics and make interventions in the systems in power.",

      "abstract": "Informal and emergent organizations play a vital role in disaster response, and are a central concern to crisis informatics. Prior research in the field has tended to focus on the activities of individual organizations during periods of disaster. Though unsurprising, this focus has led to limited understanding of the origins and long-term trajectories of these organizations or their participation in broader networks of informal response, whose individual membership, ideologies, and practices are often fluid and overlapping. In this paper, we examine the activities of informal organizations that mobilized in response to the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 17 participants, we identify five categories of resources � funding, people, information, skills, and shared values � that these organizations mobilized to sustain themselves and continue their activities long after the immediate disaster abated. We contribute insights into the adaptation decisions of emergent organizations, guidance in understanding these decisions in relation to their social and historical context, and considerations for how long-term, network-oriented studies can help address some of the contemporary challenges in crisis-informatics research.",

      "abstract": "Participation in climate activism is often facilitated by joining groups on digital platforms, for online and in-person participation in the movement. However, despite the easy access to communities digitally, people of colour (POC) are underrepresented in the UK in climate activism. Little research provides insight into why the voices of POC are underrepresented and how to level the playing field for participation in climate activism, that is just as important to POC. To investigate this, we conducted a qualitative semi-structured interview study with POC who are active in the climate movement (N=12). We identified five main themes: (i) gaining membership to the climate activism community, (ii) experiencing challenges in belonging with respect to identity characteristics, (iii) participating in protest through relevant issues and values, (iv) feeling fear due to differences and marginalisation, and (v) developing strategies for control and utilising anonymity. Our findings show how people's racial and other minoritised identity is crucial in influencing their sense of belonging and community and in turn their participation in climate activism and perhaps other opinion-based movements. For movements to be more inclusive, we urge the HCI and CSCW community to rethink designs influenced by structures of power and centre diverse values and issues instead of universal ones to amplify the voices of minoritised identities. Suggestions on how technologies could achieve this are discussed.",

Government-led infrastructure was depleted as a result of a dramatic increase in the number of individuals requesting basic necessities and food aid, and grassroots attempts to alleviate the resource shortage increased. The Community Fridge movement was one of these initiatives that combated food insecurity and food waste. It consisted of local community members sharing surplus food with neighbors via a shared refrigerator placed on a sidewalk. We conducted semi-structured interviews with its 17 users to understand how they practice information, human, and social infrastructuring work, as well as how their core values shaped norms for managing refrigerators and surplus food as the commons in local communities.

      "abstract": "There are hundreds of food delivery platforms in the United States besides the three mainstream operations: Uber Eats, Doordash, and Grubhub. However, very little is known about the sociotechnical landscape of small ``independent'' platforms. In this paper, we analyzed these independent platforms to understand why they were created, how they operate, and what technologies they use. We scraped data on 495 independent platforms and collected detailed survey responses from 29 platforms. We found that personalized, timely service is a central value of indie platforms, as is a sense of responsibility to the local community they serve. Independent platforms are motivated to provide fair rates for restaurants and couriers. These alternative business practices differentiate them from mainstream platforms. Though independent platforms have plans to expand, a lack of customizability in off-the-shelf software prevents independent platforms from personalizing services for their local communities. We show that independent platforms are a widespread and longstanding fixture of the food delivery market. We illustrate the diversity of motivations and values to explain why a one-size-fits-all support is insufficient, and we discuss the siloing of technology that inhibits platforms' growth. Through these insights, we aim to promote future HCI research into the emergence of public interest technologies for local food delivery.",

      "abstract": "Despite frequent efforts to combat racism, almost no research has explored how to cultivate positive experiences of thriving Black culture on Reddit. In this case study, we surveyed users of r/BlackPeopleTwitter (BPT)---a large, popular subreddit that showcases screenshots of hilarious or insightful social media posts made by Black people (mainly from Black Twitter). Our research questions seek to understand users' motivations for visiting BPT, how they experience a sense of virtual community (SOVC) and membership in BPT, and how BPT's governance influences these experiences. We find that that users come to BPT primarily for excellent humor and entertainment, sociopolitical context on issues relevant to Black people, and/or partaking in the shared Black experience. Black users are more likely to report higher SOVC and to identify as members, whereas non-Black users are more likely to identify as guests or visitors to the community. To protect Black expression, the BPT moderation team implemented a governance strategy for verifying racial identity and limiting participation to only verified users in certain threads. Our data suggest that this policy is a contentious but influential aspect of SOVC that simultaneously constructs and challenges the sense of the subreddit existing as a safe space for Black people. We synthesize these results by discussing how: differing platform affordances across Twitter and Reddit combine to cultivate a thriving Black community on Reddit; the need for Black authenticity on an otherwise anonymous platform can guide future research in identity verification; and the limitations of this study motivate future work to support all marginalized communities online.",

Instead, to do justice to the pluralism of (digital) societies, we should strive for an open discourse including many different perspectives on the metaverse and its core technologies such as AI. We utilize a participatory speculative design (PSD) approach to explore Japanese citizens’ perspectives on future metaverse societies, as well as social and ethical implications. Our contributions are twofold. Firstly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PSD in engaging citizens in critical discourse on emerging technologies like the metaverse by presenting our workshop framework and participants' processes. Secondly, we identify key themes from participants' perspectives, providing insights for culturally sensitive design and development of virtual environments. Our analysis shows that participants imagine the metaverse to have the potential to solve a variety of societal issues; for example, breaking down barriers of physical environments for communication, social interaction, crisis preparation, and political participation, or tackling identity-related issues. Regarding future metaverse societies, participants’ imaginations raise critical questions about human-AI relations, technical solutionism, politics and technology, globalization and local cultures, and immersive technologies. We discuss implications and contribute to expanding conversations on metaverse developments.",

      "abstract": "For young lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people, and those belonging to other marginalized sexual and gender identities (LGBTQ+), accessing information to develop one's identity and community is essential. Yet information and resource access is a particularly complex process for LGBTQ+ youth living in rural areas and small towns without dense, visible LGBTQ+ networks. While efforts to remove LGBTQ+ resources and demonize LGBTQ+ people intensify, this study asks a group of young LGBTQ+ adults living in and around a college town in the rural Midwestern United States to document their experiences with navigating information landscapes in low-resource settings. Despite the remarkable everyday creativity required to craft their information practices, participants' current efforts produce several vulnerabilities that make local queer information networks precarious and often inaccessible. We lay out several patterns in this data, including experiences of both connectedness and disconnectedness, the role of organizations in information sharing, and the existence of both active and passive information search. Building on prior research that found increasing demand for multi-modal access to relevant information that is digitally enabled, but deeply embedded in localized social geography and LGBTQ+ community, we use this data and complementary interviews to identify problem areas and potential interventions to strengthen rural LGBTQ+ young people's information access. In response to the informational needs and desires of LGBTQ+ youth in this community, we propose a series of imaginative designs. These speculative artifacts are embedded in local communities to strengthen grassroots webs of knowledge. We focus on contributing solutions that fall under three problem areas in participants' information ecosystem: increasing information stumbling, building expert capacity and support, and bridging the disconnected to the connected. We propose speculative conceptual designs that address core challenges in LGBTQ+ information networks, working in the tradition of ``information activism'' to create and maintain access to otherwise precarious and ephemeral resources and spark social change.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the design challenges that arise in supporting online freelancers to navigate relationships with clients. Prior studies have shown that current platform designs can lead to worker precarity in freelancer-client relationships, such as power imbalances, information asymmetry, and labor abuse. To envision alternative designs that empower workers in managing their relationships with clients, we engaged 22 Upwork freelancers in participatory speculative design activities. Through this co-design process, we identified design tensions that constrain design options as a result of conflicting values and priorities that could only be balanced and compromised rather than completely resolved. Six design tensions were identified in the context of designing for four different phases of freelancing. We observed three patterns in these tensions: 1) the freelancers' need for client involvement in their tasks and career growth, which conflicted with their skepticism that clients had sufficient incentives to be involved; 2) that there was often no viable balancing option for some tensions, but they could be addressed through changes in the platform's incentive structure; and 3) some tensions occurred not only between freelancers and clients, but also within the freelancer community. We present three approaches for addressing these design tensions and discuss how this research can support more equitable and healthy freelancer-client relationships.",

We found that BlindTokers leverage the affordance of the platform to create positive content, express their identities, and build communities with the desire to flourish. We proposed flourishing labor to present the work conducted by BlindTokers for their community’s flourishing with implications to support the flourishing labor. This work contributes to understanding blind users’ experience in short video platforms and highlights that flourishing is not just an activity for any single blind user but also a collective effort that necessitates serious and committed contributions from platforms and the communities they serve.",

      "abstract": "US college sports teams are increasingly adopting personal data technologies, such as wearable sensors, with a goal of improving individual and team performance as well as individual safety. Previous research has noted the potential for these tools to reinforce the power that coaches hold over student-athletes and compromise student-athletes' needs for privacy and agency. To investigate preferred, and anti-preferred, approaches for navigating this complex sociotechnical challenge, we used a speculative design approach in which student athletes and technology design students developed three videos that portray tensions between student-athletes and coaches around the use of sports tracking technologies. We then shared these videos with 15 participants including student-athletes, coaches, and designers. Drawing on the perspectives of student-athletes, team staff, and designers embedded in the videos and expressed in reaction to the videos, we describe preferences for boundaries on tracking and sharing, how tracking data represent athletes, and for data practices. We also propose design requirements and recommendations for use to better align tracking technologies with these preferences.",

However, little is known about the experiences of visually impaired users on short-video platforms like TikTok. To bridge this gap, we conducted an interview study with 30 BlindTokers (the nickname of blind TikTokers). Our study aimed to explore the various activities of BlindTokers on TikTok, including everyday entertainment, professional development, and community engagement. The widespread usage of TikTok among participants demonstrated that they considered TikTok and its associated experiences as the infrastructure for their activities. Additionally, participants reported experiencing breakdowns in this infrastructure due to accessibility issues. They had to carry out infrastructuring work to resolve the breakdowns. Blind users� various practices on TikTok also foregrounded their perceptions of independence. We then discussed blind users� nuanced understanding of the TikTok-mediated independence; we also critically examined BlindTokers� infrastructuring work for such independence.",

Our work seeks to illuminate the experiential landscape, exploring a diverse set of human augmentation technologies (HATs) for communicative purposes. We investigated this topic through four co-speculation workshops focusing on physical, cognitive, sensory and emotional augmentations with 35 participants. Through the analysis of the workshop data, we outlined speculations for 8 human augmentation technologies (HATs) for transhuman communication, grouped into four overarching augmentation clusters: (1) Bodily Changes in/for Communication, (2) Communication with Transferrable and Collective Beings, (3) Communication Through Emotion and Memory, and (4) Communication with Augmented/Altered Perception. These speculations serve as a foundation for discussions on transhumanism and communication in CSCW and beyond. Our work contributes a design space highlighting design opportunities and challenges for developing and researching near-future communication technologies.",

While creators with disabilities effectively use these platforms to share their life struggles and advocate for societal changes, the scope of research exploring the nature of the discourse activities related to disability challenges remains limited. Our study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive qualitative content analysis of 468 videos posted by YouTubers with a range of disabilities, including vision, speech, mobility, hearing, and cognitive and neural impairments. Our findings reveal a predominant discussion on stigma and lack of support. YouTube is also used to share difficulties related to communication and systemic problems. Creators with disabilities also share experiences with technologies and public and private environments, through which they discuss accessibility issues and solutions. Building on our analysis, we propose future research directions aimed at enhancing the experience and support for disability communities on video-sharing platforms.",

      "abstract": "Emoji are a popular, expressive form of non-verbal communication. However, people often use emoji is ways that result in confusing or cumbersome screen reader output. We created two accessibility support designs: (1) Preview, which displays a basic text transcript of a message with emoji that a screen reader would narrate, and (2) Alert, which summarises potential accessibility issues caused by emoji within a message. We explored our designs using an online survey and provided participants with the option to edit messages that contained emoji, should they choose to do so. We collected 1508 modified messages from 116 sighted participants, and conducted a qualitative analysis on the data to identify the strategies participants used to write accessible messages as well as their appreciation of each design. We found that participants preferred the Preview design over Alert since it allows for subjective interpretations of what constitutes an accessible message. We share insights into sighted users strategies to write in more accessible ways (e.g., rewriting the message to move the emoji to the end) and incorrect assumptions about screen readers that lead to using textual markers that are incompatible with screen readers. We discuss the implications for future designs of messaging systems that include accessibility writing tips.",

Following the month-long exhibition, during which 229 anonymous participants produced artworks, 69 non-transferable NFTs were minted, we surveyed (33) and interviewed (14) expert and novice participants about their experiences. We explored contemporary challenges of owning digital things, and the extent to which NFTs, and `Web3' technologies offer meaningful forms of ownership. Our findings describe how the inability to trade this NFT, and its unique circumstances of acquisition, made it meaningful in ways that extended beyond its immediate (limited) utility and offered participants something through which to construct identity. Reflecting on the aspirations, contradictions, and misconceptions of forms of ownership enabled by NFTs, we conclude with proposals for renewed attention in HCI to the nature of digital possessions, and the potential for �ownership design�.",

Special-purpose sensing, where there is a one-to-one relationship between sensors and applications, is evolving into general-purpose sensing, where there is a many-to-many relationship between sensors and applications. This new shift may impact how individuals think about in-home sensing, where utility and comfort are often linked to applications rather than sensed data. We explore the evolution of individuals' perceptions as they become increasingly and contextually aware of sensor capabilities and data characteristics. Through a multi-phase study where 12 participants were progressively led through six exposure conditions across laboratory and home environments, we find that exposure changes represent inflection points for perceptions of utility and comfort with data collection. These changes define opportunities for increasing trust in sensing infrastructures via data- and context-aware interventions, managing over-reliance on awareness notifications, and providing data-enabled \"what if\" analyses to balance comfort and utility within an individual's unique context and environment.",

      "abstract": "Relying on the development of crowdsourcing ideas and mobile crowd sensing (MCS) technology, many tasks that originally required a lot of manpower and material resources have been solved efficiently. However, with the development of urbanization, the traditional MCS systems have gradually been unable to cope with the demands of massive sensing tasks and high spatio-temporal sensing coverage. The challenges are as follows: 1) The scarcity of participants and the limitation of human motion rules lead to the existence of spatio-temporal blind spots in the process of collecting sensing data; 2) The single type of participants limits the sensing ability of the system and the types of data that can be collected, which affects sensing precision and quality. With the emergence of various intelligent sensing terminals in the city, the heterogeneous crowd sensing that integrates human, machine and things participants has become a new generation of sensing mode. In the spatio-temporal related sensing scenarioes, this article designs a new human-machine-things cooperative scheduling (HMT-CS) algorithm framework by comprehensively considering the diverse sensing skills, spatio-temporal trajectories, sensing costs of heterogeneous participants and system total budget constraints. The algorithm can match suitable heterogeneous participants for each task, which greatly improves the sensing quality, sensing fairness and overall utility of heterogeneous MCS systems. We combined multiple public real urban datasets to conduct an in-depth comparative analysis and comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm, and the results show that our method is superior to other baselines in all indicators.",

The gender-related discourses are often diminished when addressing public events regarding sexism and gender inequality on social media platforms.

By analyzing posts on Weibo using mixed methods, we describe the emerging discursive patterns around crime and gender, uncovering the inherent gender-blind sexism that refutes feminist discourses on the social platform. We also highlight the critical restrictions facing grassroots feminist activism in Chinese cyberspace and propose implications for the design and research related to digital feminist activism.",

      "abstract": "Extended reality (XR) technologies are becoming increasingly pervasive, and may have capacity to help marginalized groups such as transgender people. Drawing from interviews with n = 18 creators of trans technology, we examined how XR technologies do and can support trans people. We uncovered a number of creative ways that XR technologies support trans experiences. Trans technology creators are designing augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) systems that help people explore trans identity, experience new types of bodies, educate about and display trans stories and curated trans content, manipulate the physical world, and innovate gender-affirming surgical techniques. Additionally, we show how considering XR as an analogy for trans identity helps us to think about the fluidity and fluctuation inherent in trans identity in new ways: which in turn enables envisioning technologies that can better support complex and changing identities. Despite XR's potential for supporting trans people, current AR and VR systems face limitations that restrict their large-scale use, but as access to XR systems increase, so will their capacity to improve trans lives.",

Despite its prevalence and significance in informational dissemination and emotional connection, there lacks a comprehensive understanding of visual crisis communication in the aftermath of a pandemic which is characterized by uncertain local situations and emotional fatigue. To fill this gap, this work collected 345,423 crisis-related posts and 65,376 original images during the Xi'an COVID-19 local outbreak in China, and adopted a mixed-methods approach to understanding themes, goals, and strategies of crisis imagery. Image clustering captured the diversity of visual themes during the outbreak, such as text images embedding authoritative guidelines and \"visual diaries\" recording and sharing the quarantine life. Through text classification of the post that visuals were situated in, we found that different visual themes highly correlated with the informational and emotional goals of the post text, such as adopting text images to convey the latest policies and sharing food images to express anxiety. We further unpacked nuanced strategies of crisis image use through inductive coding, such as signifying authority and triggering empathy. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of crisis imagery and provide design implications to facilitate effective visual crisis communication.",

      "abstract": "Empathy is considered a crucial construct within HCI and CSCW, yet our understanding of this complex concept remains fragmented and lacks consensus in existing research. In this scoping review of 121 articles from the ACM Digital Library, we synthesize the diverse perspectives on empathy and scrutinize its current conceptualization and operationalization. In particular, we examine the various interpretations and definitions of empathy, its applications, and the methodologies, findings, and trends in the field. Our analysis reveals a lack of consensus on the definitions and theoretical underpinnings of empathy, with interpretations ranging from understanding the experiences of others to an affective response to the other's situation. We observed that despite the variety of methods used to gauge empathy, the predominant approach remains self-assessed instruments, highlighting the lack of novel and rigorously established and validated measures and methods to capture the multifaceted manifestations of empathy. Furthermore, our analysis shows that previous studies have used a variety of approaches to elicit empathy, such as experiential methods and situational awareness. These approaches have demonstrated that shared stressful experiences promote community support and relief, while situational awareness promotes empathy through increased helping behavior. Finally, we discuss a) the potential and drawbacks of leveraging empathy to shape interactions and guide design practices, b) the need to find a balance between the collective focus of empathy and the (existing and dominant) focus on the individual, and c) the careful testing of empathic designs and technologies with real-world applications.",

      "abstract": "During video conferencing, technical issues such as network impairments can unexpectedly hinder remote collaboration for distributed teams. However, it remains unclear how such issues affect the impression formation process between unacquainted interlocutors in situations like job interviews or kick-off meetings. Having first encounters online without prior in-person interaction has become prevalent nowadays. Therefore, examining the impact of technical issues on remote unacquainted interlocutors and exploring design solutions to reduce the negative impact of technical issues on the impression is essential in informing the design of future communication systems. With three controlled experiments simulating an online job interview, we discovered that technical issues made people give low credibility ratings to remote job applicants (Study 1). We further examined two intervention approaches to reduce the negative impact of technical issues in video conferencing, including a virtual agent represented in a human-like avatar to actively take responsibility for the technical issues (Study 2), and forewarning messages to inform people about the technical issues in video conferencing (Study 3). Results demonstrated that introducing an agent that represents a communication system to take responsibility for technical issues actively could reduce the responsibility people assign to remote job applicants, but without increasing their positive credibility rating for remote job applicants. Furthermore, showing forewarning messages, which explicitly made people aware the cause of technical issues was unidentifiable and its potential negative impacts on impression formation, enabled people to rate the credibility of the remote counterpart without being influenced by technical issues. We discussed how interventions can be designed to mitigate negative attribution outcomes when encountering uncontrollable technical issues in computer-mediated communication.",

      "abstract": "Migrants often face a complex situation for navigating services and administrative processes to transition and integrate into a new environment. They rely on guidance from service advisors and informal peers like other migrants to assist them. Service advisors try to understand, explore, and resolve migrant concerns through conversational interaction, while often seeking advice from other domain experts. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI)-mediated communication holds the potential for enhancing communication between migrants and service advisors while leveraging the expertise of service advisors and facilitating migrants’ autonomy in the integration process. Our research investigates the social context, mental models, and challenges encountered in guidance counseling for migrants in Finland, while examining what role AI-mediated communication can play in supporting the process. Based on our findings, we propose design implications for improving shared understanding between service advisors and migrants through salient summarization of conversations and creating collaborative visual narratives. Our findings also indicate the crucial role of leveraging peer-based knowledge between (and within) service advisors, domain experts, and migrants, which can be facilitated by AI-based tools. Our exploratory research offers insights into human-centered AI integration in the migration process, as well as the opportunities and challenges of using AI-mediated communication to improve the migrant experience.",

While prior HCI studies have examined labour relations in domains such as platform work, few have looked at industrial settings. This paper presents an ethnographic study of works councils in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Germany. Works councils exemplify the principle of Co-Determination, which is the right of employees to participate in the design and management of their workplace and play a vital role in vetting new technologies whenever they imply changes in work practices. A number of issues confront works councils when they attempt to accomplish this, namely a lack of time, knowledge, and external support. We discuss these issues and consider their implications for both design and the constitution of workplace democracy in future industrial settings.",

Emerging from asset-based community development (ABCD), an approach to community and economic development research and practice that emerged in the 1990s, advocates for asset-based approaches argue that a �needs-based approach� to development is overly focused on community deficits, and in doing so portrays communities in a largely negative light. Using ABCD methods, social computing scholars work to aid communities in identifying, classifying, and deploying their unrealized assets through sociotechnical systems. But researchers deploying asset-based approaches in CSCW and HCI more broadly have yet to grapple with the origins of ABCD in neoliberal economic shifts of the 1980s and 1990s that perpetuated distrust in the state and sought to transfer development power to private, local actors.

We present DesignQuizzer, which asks questions about visual design in UI examples and provides structured comment summaries. Two user studies demonstrate the engagement and usefulness of DesignQuizzer compared with the baseline (reading reddit.com/r/UI_design). We also showcase how effectively novices can apply what they learn with DesignQuizzer in a design critique task and a visual design task.

In this study, we investigate how \\textit{BeReal}, a social media platform designed to counter some of these pressures, influences adolescents' self-presentation behaviors. We interviewed 29 users aged 13-18 to understand their experiences with BeReal. We found that BeReal's design focuses on spontaneous sharing, including randomly timed daily notifications and reciprocal posting, discourages staged posts, encourages careful curation of the audience, and reduces pressure on self-presentation. The space created by BeReal offers benefits such as validating an unfiltered life and reframing social comparison, but its approach to self-presentation is sometimes perceived as limited or unappealing and, at times, even toxic. Drawing on this empirical data, we distill a set of design guidelines for creating platforms that support authentic self-presentation online, such as scaffolding reciprocity and expanding beyond spontaneous photo-sharing to allow users to more accurately and comfortably portray themselves.",

In this paper we provide insights into attempts to intervene in such a regional innovation system via practice-oriented activities. Our findings describe experiences of co-creating knowledge around digitization of SMEs on a regional level, beyond individual company contexts. We reflect on the benefits and challenges such an approach affords and highlight the importance of interpersonal relationships and similarities between practices in different contexts to enable intended but also initially unexpected knowledge spillovers. Our findings highlight how a praxeological approach to CSCW can be influential in regional development programs, and open this field to CSCW research and design.

In our studies, we particularly focused the parents who have a child under 13 years of age. To this end, deriving from developmental psychology, we base our low-fidelity prototype design (termed as `treatment') on a set of design principles focusing on open communication, instilling self-regulation, and availing granularity along with designs of existing Google's parental control as a baseline. First, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 parents to understand their perceptions, including suggestions for design improvement within our prototype. Then, we conducted an online study over MTurk with 156 participants to compare and evaluate the treatment condition against the baseline in the realm of our design principles. As reflected in our results, parents appreciated the insights into the children's activities to have a meaningful discussion with them, the significance of nudges in instilling self-regulation, and the usefulness of granularity in a wide range of contexts, including shielding the children from inappropriate content and defining purpose-specific device usage. The findings from our studies lead to the recommendations, and the guideline for future research in the sphere of developmental parenting and inclusiveness.",

      "abstract": "The reliability of online dating algorithms has sparked considerable debate, particularly regarding skepticism about their excessive emphasis on evaluating and getting evaluated which often overshadows the quest for authentic romantic connections. To understand the multifaceted influence of dating algorithms on end-users and explore avenues for algorithmic features considering the dynamics of human relationships, we conducted a mixed-methods study comprising in-depth interviews (N = 22) and a metaphoric co-design workshop (N = 12) with active users of online dating platforms. Interviews revealed that users perceive and respond to algorithmic evaluations with varied perception and behaviors, often expressing concerns about the emotional burden of constant self-presentation and the pursuit of quantitative assessments over genuine connections. In the design workshop, users envisioned desired algorithmic features to overcome investigated  challenges, such as prioritizing personal values, tailored matchmaking, and support for personal growth in relationships. This research contributes to unravel the complex dynamics of human-algorithm interaction in the context of online dating. By aligning algorithmic functions more closely with user desires and relationship goals, this study paves the way for more meaningful and authentic connections in the digital dating landscape.",

Risk detection AI has emerged as an approach to preventing such harms, however a myopic focus on computational performance has been criticized in HCI literature for failing to consider how users should interact with risk detection AI to stay safe. In this paper we report an interview study with woman-identifying online daters (n=20) about how they envision interacting with risk detection AI and how risk detection models can be designed pursuant to such interactions. Findings show that women anticipate interacting with risk detection AI to augment - not replace - their personal risk assessment strategies. They likewise designed risk detection models to amplify their subjective and admittedly biased indicators of risk. Design implications involve the notion of personalizable risk detection models, but also ethical concerns around perpetuating problematic stereotypes associated with risk.",

      "abstract": "Early parenting is one of the strongest predictors of child well-being. Online social communities have shown promise in supporting parents across a range of contexts. However, we only have a limited understanding of how posters and commenters interact within a forum, or how well commenter responses can support complex parenting questions, such as attempts to change a child's behaviour or to apply new parenting approaches. We start addressing this gap by combining an empirical analysis of 1 year of parent posts from an exemplar online forum (Mumsnet) with literature on parenting interventions from psychology. In particular, we examine the types of question parents of 2-5 year olds seek help for around their children's behaviour, and the challenges with the support that they do (or do not) receive from the Mumsnet community. Combining empirical and theory-driven insights, we outline an 'information-to-application' gap that conceptually underpins the difficulties observed, and suggest plausible research directions that could address such design problems.",

However, what drives individuals to one approach over the other remains unknown, and so difficult to design sociotechnical systems for.\nThrough focus group interviews with still-together couples, we present a decision-making framework for data management. We outline factors that can influence individuals� decision to act as an archivist or revisionist in the wake of a break-up.

      "abstract": "Smart home technologies are making their way into families. Parents' and children's shared use of smart home technologies has received growing attention in CSCW and related research communities. Families and children are also frequently featured as target audiences in smart home product marketing. However, there is limited knowledge of how exactly children and family interactions are portrayed in smart home product marketing, and to what extent those portrayals align with the actual consideration of children and families in product features and resources for child safety and privacy. We conducted a content analysis of product websites and online resources of 102 smart home products, as these materials constitute a main marketing channel and information source about products for consumers. We found that despite featuring children in smart home marketing, most analyzed product websites did not mention child safety features and lacked sufficient information on how children's data is collected and used. Specifically, our findings highlight misalignments in three aspects: (1) children are depicted as users of smart home products but there are insufficient child-friendly product features; (2) harmonious child-product co-presence is portrayed but potential child safety issues are neglected; and (3) children are shown as the subject of monitoring and datafication but there is limited information on child data collection and use. We discuss how parent-child relationships and parenting may be negatively impacted by such marketing depictions, and we provide design and policy recommendations for better incorporating child safety and privacy considerations into smart home products.",

      "abstract": "The field of human-computer interaction (HCI) has traditionally focused on the design of information technology artifacts. However, such artifacts have often hindered the populations they aim to support due to the lack of sustainable considerations for tech maintenance and repair over the long term. Drawing on two multi-year programs for small-scale tech capacity building in post-industrial U.S. cities, this article presents a comparative analysis and retrospective ethnography to investigate the challenges and strategies for sustained community-based research in computing. In particular, our work aimed to better understand and contribute the necessary considerations and dynamics among the academic-community partnerships attributed to sustaining the community-based programs over time. We identify three key opportunities for fostering sustainability and being anticipatory rather than surprised by the twists and turns in our community-based research projects: relational (e.g., considerations of care, trust, and responsiveness alongside continual expectation setting), economic (e.g., leveraging research funding to kickstart long-term community programming), and technological (e.g., contextualized guidance on tech investments, embedded training on tech use). While opportunities for sustainability in community-based research have been referenced in prior work, findings from this unique and rare opportunity contribute concrete examples of two community-based engagements that were required to carry out such suggestions in the context of two tech capacity building programs. Such details often go unreported in scholarly articles yet are essential for sustainability considerations. We conclude with a discussion about ongoing challenges from this research and considerations for future work such as rethinking longevity (e.g., when longevity should and should not be the end goal).",

      "abstract": "With the increasing use of computer and smartphones by children, their online safety has been of major concern due to their limited security knowledge and skills. User authentication is pivotal for their security protection, where a body of work focused on children's password practices. The insights from these studies highlight children's lack of awareness and skills in creating a strong password. However, there is a dearth in existing literature to understand the scopes of designs for encouraging and empowering children towards strong passwords. As we begin to address this gap, we leveraged the power of storytelling to foster user attachment, encouragement, and empowerment. To this end, we adopted a systematic approach through a series of studies. First, a focus group session with three experts whose research primarily focuses on children contributed to build the narrative of a story, followed by a participatory design study with 20 children (aged between 8 and 12) to understand their preferences and perceptions of design components for the visual depiction of that narrative. The insights from focus group and participatory design led to the design of `Story', a digital storytelling based design representing password advice for children. We also created the baseline designs and compared them with Story in a within-subject survey with 44 children aged between 8 and 12. The findings from our study unpack the efficacy of storytelling, leading us to offer guidelines for future research in these directions.",

However, current platforms are not designed in a way that accounts for sapphic lived experience, especially the lived experience of sapphics who hold multiple marginalized identity characteristics. Even on platforms that do exist for sapphics, transgender women and nonbinary people are often subject to discrimination, fetishization, and stigmatization. To aid in the design of platforms that better serve the needs of multiply marginalized sapphics, we engaged a diverse group of 25 sapphics in six rounds of community discussion on key topics for relationship platform design. Based on participant discussions, we identify key challenges when designing for multiply marginalized sapphics around relationship structures, gender and sexuality classification, and safety priorities for interaction. We present two design priorities alongside community-sourced design directions which can help future designers address these challenges: identity-centric safety and community-based information formats.",

OSS is an important form of digital infrastructure and part of a career path for many developers. While there exists a growing body of literature on cisgender women’s under-representation in OSS, the experiences of contributors from other marginalized groups are comparatively absent from the literature. Such is the case for trans contributors, a historically influential group in OSS. In this study, we interviewed 21 trans participants to understand and represent their experiences in the OSS literature. From their experiences, we theorize two related paradoxes of openness in OSS: the paradox of openness and display and the paradox of openness and governance. In an increasingly violent world for trans people, we draw on our theorizing to build recommendations for more inclusive and safer OSS projects for contributors.",

      "abstract": "Explainability techniques are rapidly being developed to improve human-AI decision-making across various cooperative work settings. Consequently, previous research has evaluated how decision-makers collaborate with imperfect AI by investigating appropriate reliance and task performance with the aim of designing more human-centered computer-supported collaborative tools. Several human-centered explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been proposed in hopes of improving decision-makers' collaboration with AI; however, these techniques are grounded in findings from previous studies that primarily focus on the impact of incorrect AI advice. Few studies acknowledge the possibility for the explanations to be incorrect even if the AI advice is correct. Thus, it is crucial to understand how imperfect XAI affects human-AI decision-making. In this work, we contribute a robust, mixed-methods user study with 136 participants to evaluate how incorrect explanations influence humans' decision-making behavior in a bird species identification task taking into account their level of expertise and an explanation's level of assertiveness. Our findings reveal the influence of imperfect XAI and humans' level of expertise on their reliance on AI and human-AI team performance. We also discuss how explanations can deceive decision-makers during human-AI collaboration. Hence, we shed light on the impacts of imperfect XAI in the field of computer-supported cooperative work and provide guidelines for designers of human-AI collaboration systems.",

      "abstract": "When users perceive AI systems as mindful, independent agents, they hold them responsible instead of the AI experts who created and designed these systems. So far, it has not been studied whether explanations support this shift in responsibility through the use of mind-attributing verbs like \"to think\". To better understand the prevalence of mind-attributing explanations we analyse AI explanations in 3,533 explainable AI (XAI) research articles from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC). Using methods from semantic shift detection, we identify three dominant types of mind attribution: (1) metaphorical (e.g. \"to learn\" or \"to predict\"), (2) awareness (e.g. \"to consider\"), and (3) agency (e.g. \"to make decisions\"). We then analyse the impact of mind-attributing explanations on awareness and responsibility in a vignette-based experiment with 199 participants. We find that participants who were given a mind-attributing explanation were more likely to rate the AI system as aware of the harm it caused. Moreover, the mind-attributing explanation had a responsibility-concealing effect: Considering the AI experts' involvement lead to reduced ratings of AI responsibility for participants who were given a non-mind-attributing or no explanation. In contrast, participants who read the mind-attributing explanation still held the AI system responsible despite considering the AI experts' involvement. Taken together, our work underlines the need to carefully phrase explanations about AI systems in scientific writing to reduce mind attribution and clearly communicate human responsibility.",

While black-boxing AI systems can make the user experience seamless, hiding the seams risks disempowering users to mitigate fallouts from AI mistakes. While Explainable AI (XAI) has predominantly tackled algorithmic opaqueness, we propose that seamful design can foster Human-centered XAI by strategically revealing sociotechnical and infrastructural mismatches. We introduce the notion of Seamful XAI by (1) conceptually transferring �seams� to the AI context and (2) developing a design process that helps stakeholders design with seams, thereby augmenting explainability and user agency. We explore this process with 43 AI practitioners and users, using a scenario-based co-design activity informed by real-world use cases. We share empirical insights, implications, and critical reflections on how this process can help practitioners anticipate and craft seams in AI, how seamfulness can improve explainability, empower end-users, and facilitate Responsible AI.",

However, mobility is a complex issue given the numerous socio-political factors implicated. This necessitates approaching climate-related transformations around mobility, including the information, data and tools involved, from a social justice angle. Drawing on interviews with mobility justice grassroot organizations across Canada, we identify four challenges around how the design and use of existing mobility tools and technologies perpetuate mobility injustices and deepen the divide between urban planners and the public. We then discuss the influence of path-dependence as a systemic barrier that propagates mobility injustices. Further, we highlight tactics used by mobility justice advocates that research in HCI and CSCW can enable in order to address path-dependence, attend to the broader socio-political factors that influence transportation planning, support practices that legitimize marginalized perspectives and reframe mobility transformations from an efficiency problem to a deep commitment to place and people.",

      "abstract": "As misinformation increasingly proliferates on social media platforms, it has become crucial to explore how to best convey automated news credibility assessments to end-users, and foster trust in fact-checking AIs. In this paper, we investigate how model-agnostic, natural language explanations influence trust and reliance on a fact-checking AI. We construct explanations from four Conceptualisation Validations (CVs) – namely consensual, expert, internal (logical), and empirical – which are foundational units of evidence that humans utilise to validate and accept new information. Our results show that providing explanations significantly enhances trust in AI, even in a fact-checking context where influencing pre-existing beliefs is often challenging, with different CVs causing varying degrees of reliance. We find consensual explanations to be the least influential, with expert, internal, and empirical explanations exerting twice as much influence. However, we also find that users could not discern whether the AI directed them towards the truth, highlighting the dual nature of explanations to both guide and potentially mislead. Further, we uncover the presence of automation bias and aversion during collaborative fact-checking, indicating how users' previously established trust in AI can moderate their reliance on AI judgements. We also observe the manifestation of a 'boomerang'/backfire effect often seen in traditional corrections to misinformation, with individuals who perceive AI as biased or untrustworthy doubling down and reinforcing their existing (in)correct beliefs when challenged by the AI. We conclude by presenting nuanced insights into the dynamics of user behaviour during AI-based fact-checking, offering important lessons for social media platforms.",

      "abstract": "Hybrid work has become increasingly popular in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite its popularity, many organisations still strive to find an answer to ``how to do hybrid cooperation right''. Enabling collaboration across digital and physical workspaces, participants, and practices is a great challenge, as it inevitably introduces asymmetric relations, incongruences in frames of reference, and misaligned ecosystems and technical infrastructures. The paper investigates approaches used to manage asymmetries in hybrid work settings and their impact on cooperation. Through a multi-sited ethnographic study, we reveal a prevalent reliance on mimicking tools and practices native to fully physical or fully digital settings in the hybrid space. These mimicking practices often arise because the hybrid work setting is viewed through a deficit lens, whereby it is perceived as lacking certain elements (e.g., body, voice, mobility) and access to modalities from especially the physical setting, thereby necessitating the need for compensation work. To provide vocabulary to conceptualize and articulate this type of practice, we introduce the concept \\textit{compensation work}, referring to work that is carried out to offset a deficiency or absence that has been identified, aiming to restore and re-establish a familiar state that has vanished. \nWhile compensating through mimicking is intuitive, such approaches assume that our known practices and interactions from the physical workspace can indeed be translated to another context, neglecting the fact that changing the medium inevitably impacts the message. Thus, cooperative practices and interactions taking place in the physical workspace do not remain the same when unfolding in the hybrid space. Finally, we suggest that in order to design technologies and practices that support hybrid cooperation we first need to acknowledge the hybrid workspace as a distinct ``third space'' next to the fully remote and fully physical workspace. This includes following an experience-driven approach to hybrid cooperation, encouraging the design of innovative interactions that extend beyond merely compensating for asymmetries and leveraging the unique capabilities and affordances of these settings.",

      "abstract": "The popularity of social virtual reality (VR) platforms such as VRChat has led to growing concerns about new and more severe forms of online harassment targeting one's identity characteristics (i.e., identity-based harassment). Social VR users with marginalized identities (e.g., women, LGBTQIA+ individuals, and racial/ethnic minorities) have been reported as particularly vulnerable to such harassment. This is mainly because social VR can make one's offline identity known to others (i.e., what we term identity revelation in this work) through a unique combination of avatar design, voice use, and immersive full- or partial-body tracking. To address these safety concerns, there is an urgent need to unpack the complex dynamics surrounding how one's offline identity is (mis)perceived by others, and how these (mis)perceptions may affect identity-based harassment in social VR. This study thus utilizes a large-scale survey with 223 social VR users across six continents/regions of the world with varying social VR experiences and identities to investigate (1) the relationship between identity-based harassment in social VR and (mis)perceptions of selective identity revelation practices, (2) how embodying one's identity in social VR might actually be less risky than once thought, and (3) how who you are does still matter when it comes to identity-based harassment in social VR. It also highlights the need to better account for understudied aspects of identity-based harassment in social VR and to better educate social VR users on the interplay between harassment and (mis)perceived identity revelation in these spaces.",

      "abstract": "Designing new technologies to support synchronous interaction across distances has for many years focused on creating symmetry for participation between geographically distributed actors. Symmetry in synchronous interaction has, to some extent, been achieved technologically (while multiple social, historical, political, and hierarchical concerns continue to exist) and proven empirically in the increased use of remote-work technologies that were used during the pandemic. However, synchronous interaction in hybrid work is achieved differently, since the asymmetry produced by some participants being collocated while others geographically distributed introduces increased complexities for such interactions. Focusing on this challenge, we ask: To what extent can symmetry in cooperative work engagements be achieved in hybrid work contexts? We explore this question by interrogating multiple different empirical examples of synchronous hybrid interaction collected across different organizations, activities, and events. We found that the effort required to accomplish hybrid work includes additional articulation work necessary for bounding multiple intertwined artefacts across sites, devices, and applications. Further, the multiple artefacts setup across sites, combined with asymmetric collocation across participants, produce incongruence in technological frames of reference for each participant. All participants in hybrid work have only partial access to the hybrid setup, and no single person has access to the complete setup. The incongruence in technological frames produces insurmountable gaps in collaboration, causing all hybrid work situations to be characterized fundamentally by asymmetric relationships. We argue that symmetry in hybrid synchronous interaction is impossible to attain in attempts to solve this problem through design. Instead, we propose that designers of cooperative technologies for hybrid work shift towards developing artefact-ecologies supporting hybrid work, focusing on asymmetry as a necessary feature. Fundamentally, the design strategy should explore novel ways of taking advantage of the multiple different artefact-ecologies which serve as the foundation for the hybrid collaboration. Instead of striving for symmetry, we propose to feature asymmetric conditions in future technology designs for hybrid interaction.",

      "abstract": "Phantom tactile sensation (PTS) is usually experienced by participants in laboratory settings with the assistance and supervision of professionals. Extensive reports from users demonstrate they experience PTS on commercially available virtual reality (VR) platforms. We gathered and analyzed 2885 posts by 1408 users to understand how users obtain PTS and how they evaluate their PTS experience. We observed that users experience PTS in three ways: 1) starting to feel it naturally, 2) intentionally developing the ability to experience PTS, and 3) feeling it under substance use. Users perceive the sensation differently. Many people perceive PTS as positive, enhancing their immersion and bringing people closer. While other users consider it a negative experience as it exacerbates harassment issues, or the sensation itself is negative, even painful. We discuss the perceived causes of PTS and how social VR conditions users' evaluation of their PTS experience. We further reflect on PTS from the perspective of the risk of VR use in real-life scenarios. Finally, we provide design implications on employing PTS to enhance users' VR experience and reduce the negatives PTS brings.",

      "abstract": "Imagine being able to send a personalized embodied agent to meetings you are unable to attend. This paper explores the idea of a Ditto — an agent that visually resembles a person, sounds like them, possesses knowledge about them, and can represent them in meetings. This paper reports on results from two empirical investigations: 1) focus group sessions with six groups (n=24) and 2) a Wizard of Oz (WOz) study with 10 groups (n=39) recruited from within a large technology company. Results from the focus group sessions provide insights on what contexts are appropriate for Dittos, and issues around social acceptability and representation risk. The focus group results also provide feedback on visual design characteristics for Dittos. In the WOz study, teams participated in meetings with two different embodied agents: a Ditto and a Delegate (an agent which did not resemble the absent person). Insights from this research demonstrate the impact these embodied agents can have in meetings, and highlights that Dittos in particular show promise in evoking feelings of presence and trust, as well as informing decision making. These results also highlight issues related to relationship dynamics such as maintaining social etiquette, managing one's professional reputation, and upholding accountability. Overall, our investigation provides early evidence that Dittos could be beneficial to represent users when they are unable to be present but also outlines many factors that need to be carefully considered to successfully realize this vision.",

It may suffer from repetitive results, inefficient time management, and stagnation in discussion. Seeing the rich opportunities of virtual reality (VR) in visualizing the environments, we propose to use (1) scene-switching and (2) creative visualization of time constraints to facilitate this process. The current study sought to explore the effects of these two factors on brainstorming performance in VR. By conducting a mixed-method study of 20 three-participant groups, we found that scene-switching and implicit time limitations can stimulate creativity, establish diverse atmospheres, and open up new conversations during brainstorming. Additionally, we provide suggestions for visualizing time constraints and various virtual environments based on research results.",

      "abstract": "Video meeting systems offer great potential for work and life, but they can also have negative effects.\nOne reason is the presence of technical stimuli that do not exist in the physical world. A prominent example is the self-view feature, a mirrored image of oneself shown during the video meeting. The self-view feature comes with a trade-off between the advantage of enhancing control and the disadvantage of increasing cognitive load of its users. \nSo far, research is scarce when it comes to understanding this ambivalent nature and studies mostly relied on self-reported data without considering the actual interaction with the self-view. To address this gap, we conducted an experimental study with 57 participants and two design variants (with/without self-view), analyzed user perceptions through surveys and interviews, and explored gaze patterns using eye-tracking technology. Results reveal varying perceptions of cognitive load and control among self-view users and between the design variants, highlighting its ambivalent nature. We see differences in how participants interact with the self-view. In a cluster analysis, we identify three user groups (Benefiting Users, Cognitively Challenged Users, Control Losing Users). These groups also show differences in visual behavior, especially median fixation duration, and user characteristics. Based on our findings, we outline design recommendations for more flexible and intelligent design solutions by considering user groups and their individual differences.",

The Hybridge experimental system provides different interfaces for remote and room endpoints, focusing on improving inclusion via shared spatiality and remote agency. In-room users see remotes on displays around a table, and remotes see video integrated into a digital twin. Remotes can choose where to appear and from where they view the room. We tested Hybridge in a within-subjects study of group survival tasks. An in-person condition was followed by a counterbalanced order of hybrid traditional videoconferencing  (\"Gallery\") and Hybridge. We found that co-presence and agency differences between in-room and remotes were alleviated in Hybridge but remained in Gallery. Physical presence for remotes was higher in Hybridge than Gallery. Conversation flow was better in Hybridge than Gallery, but ease of awareness was not different. We argue that asymmetry should be embraced when designing hybrid meeting systems, with inclusivity achieved by tailoring features for the needs of different endpoints.",

      "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) can immerse users into engaging experiences, affording opportunities to study behaviour in simulated contexts such as decision-making processes. However, methodological research into designing meaningful VR experiences - experiences that promote appreciation and deeper understanding of a work - is still underdeveloped. In this two-part study, we investigate how visual point-of-view (POV) in VR impacts feelings of meaningfulness and empathy as well as objective decision-making processes. Our study revolves around a VR application that situates users in moral dilemmas from three different POVs. Data from the choices made is augmented with self-reported subjective data. We find that, from different POVs, users' subjective feelings do show change; users show greater empathy for virtual agents and have an increasingly meaningful experience from a first-person perspective, even if this is not always reflected in changes in their decisions. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings in the context of VR application design.",

Design speed-dating workshops were conducted to explore dimensions of the consent communication design space, including social media, interactive quizzes, chat-bots, annotation tools, and virtual learning sessions. To explore both the user experience and how futuristic consent processes might be facilitated, the workshops involved people eligible to participate in digital health research (N=21) and research service providers (N=20), including researchers and IRB members. Our findings offer five principles to improve digital informed consent processes: be concise, promote transparency, value time and effort, cultivate trust, and navigate platform specific risks.",

      "abstract": "Communicating about some vital topics---such as sexuality and health---is treated as taboo and subjected to censorship. How can we construct knowledge about these topics? Wikipedia is home to numerous high-quality knowledge artifacts about taboo topics like sexual organs and human reproduction. How did these artifacts come into being? How is their existence sustained? This mixed-methods comparative project builds on previous work on taboo topics in Wikipedia and draws from qualitative and quantitative approaches. We follow a sequential complementary design, developing a narrative articulation of the life of taboo articles, comparing them to nontaboo articles, and examining some of their quantifiable traits. We find that taboo knowledge artifacts develop through multiple successful collaboration styles and, unsurprisingly, that taboo subjects are the sites of conflict. We identify and describe six themes in the development of taboo knowledge artifacts. These artifacts need resilient leadership and engaged organizations to thrive under conditions of limited identifiability and disjointed sensemaking, while contributors simultaneously engage in emergent governance and imagining public audiences. Our observations have important implications for supporting public knowledge work on controversial subjects such as taboos and more generally.",

      "abstract": "Social computing scholars have long known that people do not interact with knowledge in straightforward ways, especially in digital environments. While policies around knowledge are essential for targeting misinformation, they are value-laden; in choosing how to present information, we undermine non-traditional---often non-Western---ways of knowing. Epistemic injustice is the systemic exclusion of certain people and methods from the knowledge canon. In this paper, we articulate how epistemic injustice in sociotechnical applications leads to material harm. Inspired by a hybrid collaborative autoethnography of 14 CSCW practitioners, we present three cases of epistemic injustice in sociotechnical applications: online transgender healthcare, identity sensemaking on r/bisexual, and indigenous ways of knowing on r/AskHistorians. We further explore signature tensions across our autoethnographic materials and relate them to previous CSCW research areas and personal non-technological experiences. We argue that epistemic injustice can serve as a unifying and intersectional lens for CSCW research by surfacing dimensions of epistemic community and power. Finally, we present a call to action of three changes the CSCW community should make to move toward its own goals of research justice.",

This study characterizes the conversational styles, demographics, psychologies, and emotional tendencies of the most active users (i.e., top 1\\% by message count) of a commercial chatbot platform (SimSimi.com), whom we refer to as \\textit{superusers}. We analyze the linguistic patterns and topics of 1,988,971 messages by 1,994 superusers written over a period of three years. We further surveyed 76 users to observe their emotional dispositions and perceptions towards the chatbot. We find that superusers of SimSimi empathize and humanize the chatbot more than less active users and show higher tendency to share personal and negative feelings. Our finding suggests that chatbots need new design considerations for users who are vulnerable due to their high anthropomorphism and openness toward machines. Our work also shows that chatbots should have functions to offer social support when necessary.",

In the case of technologies for individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD), the end-users are historically left out of the design process. Further deepening the disconnect between this group and technology, they are also excluded from formal technology design knowledge sharing, such as college courses. To address this, our study investigates the efficacy of a formal classroom adaptation of co-design activities to encourage learning and participation. Through collaboration between educators and designers, we adopted user-centered co-design activities to facilitate knowledge and application of technological design methods within a class of 13 students with IDD. Findings uncovered factors contributing to co-teaching collaboration planning and reflection between educators and designers, and ways that activities can provide accessible collaborative learning environments for students with IDD by supporting collaboration, cognitive engagement, and meta-cognition. We discuss how these factors can support successful co-teacher collaborations that promote student empowerment. Finally, we contribute collaborative co-teaching strategies for educational co-design activities for individuals with IDD.",

      "abstract": "Using chatbots to make recommendations is increasingly popular. The design of recommendation chatbots has mainly been taking an information-centric approach by focusing on the recommended content per se. Limited attention is on how social connection and relational strategies, such as self-disclosure from a chatbot, may influence users' perception and acceptance of the recommendation. In this work, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a social chatbot capable of performing three different levels of self-disclosure: factual information (low), cognitive opinions (medium), and emotions (high). In the evaluation, we recruited 372 participants to converse with the chatbot on two topics: movies and COVID-19 experiences. In each topic, the chatbot conducted small talks and made relevant recommendations to the topic. Participants were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions where the chatbot used factual, cognitive, emotional, and adaptive strategies to perform self-disclosures. By training a text classifier to identify users' level of self-disclosure in real-time, the adaptive chatbot can dynamically match its self-disclosure language to the level of disclosure exhibited by the users. Our results show that users reciprocate with higher-level self-disclosure when a recommendation chatbot displays emotions throughout the conversation. The utilization of emotional disclosure by the chatbot resulted in enhanced enjoyment during interactions and a more favorable perception of the bot. This, in turn, led to greater effectiveness in making recommendations, including a higher likelihood of accepting the recommendation. We discuss the understandings obtained and implications to future design.",

In this study, we contribute to the growing body of CSCW research on accessibility and investigate the invisible access labor of neurodivergent students in three computer science institutions. We use an exploratory, multi-stakeholder approach, combining semi-structured interviews (n=26) and document analysis. We adopted a broad definition of neurodiversity: our study included individuals with autism, dyslexia,  ADHD, cyclothymia and individuals with neurological conditions that developed as a result of illness, trauma or injury. Our findings show that neurodivergent students face a number of structural and attitudinal barriers to access in the educational environment and within the disability support system. We identified barriers in three main areas: (i) assistive technology access barriers, (ii) cognitive and physical access barriers, and (iii) social access barriers. We examined how stigma, individualized understandings of disability and intersectional disadvantage shape organizational practices and explored how students are creatively improving collective access through micro-interventions, although these efforts are largely invisible. We then draw on our findings to identify opportunities for change. We propose access grafting as a bottom-up approach to rethinking and reorienting organizational strategies to improve equitable access.",

      "abstract": "Meals are a central (and messy) part of family life. Previous design framings for mealtime technologies have focused on supporting dietary needs or social and celebratory interactions at the dinner table; however, family meals involve the coordination of many activities and complicated family dynamics. In this paper, we report on findings from interviews and design sessions with 18 families from the Midwestern United States (including both partners/parents and children) to uncover important family differences and tensions that arise around domestic meal experiences. Drawing on feminist theory, we unpack the work of feeding a family as a form of care, drawing attention to the social and emotional complexity of family meals. Critically situating our data within current design narratives, we propose the sensitizing concepts of generative and systemic discontents as a productive way towards troubling the design space of family-food interaction to contend with the struggles that are a part of everyday family meal experiences.",

      "abstract": "Discussing research-sensemaking questions on Community Question and Answering (CQA) platforms has been an increasingly common practice for the public to participate in science communication. Nonetheless, how users strategically craft research-sensemaking questions to engage public participation and facilitate knowledge construction is a significant yet less understood problem. To fill this gap, we collected 837 science-related questions and 157,684 answers from Zhihu, and conducted a mixed-methods study to explore user-developed strategies in proposing research-sensemaking questions, and their potential effects on public engagement and knowledge construction. Through open coding, we captured a comprehensive taxonomy of question-crafting strategies, such as eyecatching narratives with counter-intuitive claims and rigorous descriptions with data use. Regression analysis indicated that these strategies correlated with user engagement and answer construction in different ways (e.g., emotional questions attracted more views and answers), yet there existed a general divergence between wide participation and quality knowledge establishment, when most questioning strategies could not ensure both. Based on log analysis, we further found that collaborative editing afforded unique values in refining research-sensemaking questions regarding accuracy, rigor, comprehensiveness and attractiveness. We propose design implications to facilitate accessible, accurate and engaging science communication on CQA platforms.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy, a prevalent chronic neurological disorder, presents numerous challenges for people with epilepsy (PWEs) and their caregivers. They experience difficulties in receiving proper care and support due to stigma and misconceptions. Promoting public awareness in early education would be critical to reduce the stigma and to properly support them. We conducted 145 surveys and 21 interviews with teachers, school nurses, and parents of elementary and middle school students. While the participants exhibited slightly positive attitudes towards PWEs, we identified obstacles that hinder learning about epilepsy and seizure first aid: inadequate education and limited information sharing among school stakeholders. Moreover, there is a pressing need for age-appropriate education that considers the students' ages and perceptual levels. Considering the current limitations and needs, we propose potential implications for future information and communication technologies (ICTs) designs, including knowledge-sharing systems and an educational game aimed at enhancing epilepsy awareness and fostering collaborative care in elementary and middle school environments.",

However, attempts to restructure the existing moderation practices can be difficult, especially for platforms that rely on their communities to moderate, because changes can transform the workflow and workload participants' reward systems. By examining the extensive archival discussions around a prepublication moderation technology on Wikipedia named Flagged Revisions, complemented by seven semi-structured interviews, we identify various challenges in restructuring community-based moderation practices. Thus, we find that while a new system might sound good in theory and perform well in terms of quantitative metrics, it may conflict with existing social norms. Furthermore, our findings underscore how the relationship between platforms and self-governed communities can hinder the ability to assess the performance of any new system and introduce considerable costs related to maintaining, overhauling, or scrapping any piece of infrastructure.",

Expert-led crowdsourcing approaches show\npromise, but tend to either focus on narrow tasks or domains, or require resource-intense, long-term relationships between expert\ninvestigators and crowds. We address this gap by providing a flexible framework that enables investigators across domains to enlist\ncrowdsourced support for discovery and verification of OSINT. We use a design-based research (DBR) approach to develop OSINT\nResearch Studios (ORS), a sociotechnical system in which novice crowds are trained to support professional investigators with complex\nOSINT investigations.

Current CAs can ask predetermined questions but lack skills for asking follow-up questions. Thus, we designed three approaches for CAs to automatically ask follow-up questions, i.e., follow-ups on concepts, follow-ups on related concepts, and general follow-ups. To investigate their effects, we conducted a user study (N=26) in which a CA interviewer asked follow-up questions generated by algorithms and crafted by human wizards. Our results showed that the CA's follow-up questions were readable and effective in information elicitation. The follow-ups on concepts and related concepts achieved a lower drop rate and better relevance, while the general follow-ups elicited more informative responses. Further qualitative analysis of the human-CA interview data revealed algorithm drawbacks and identified follow-up question techniques used by the human wizards.

In this Wizard of Oz experiment, 34 middle-aged (50 to 64 years old) and 24 older adults (65 to 80 years old) participated in a user study at a simulated home, interacting with a VA using either formal or informal language. Older adults with higher agreeableness perceived VA as being more likable than middle-aged adults. Middle-aged adults showed similar technology acceptance toward the informal and formal VA, and older adults preferred using informal VA, especially those with low agreeableness. Further, while both middle-aged and older adults frequently anthropomorphized VAs by using human metaphors for them, older adults compared formal VA with professionals (e.g., librarians, teachers) and informal VA with their close ones (e.g., spouses, relatives). Overall, the conversational style showed differential effects on the perceptions of middle-aged and older adults, suggesting personalized design implications.",

Many technologies have been invented to support solo or group mindfulness practice such as mobile apps, live streams, virtual reality environments, and wearables. In this paper, we present findings from an interview study with 20 experienced mindfulness practitioners about their everyday mindfulness practices and technology use. Participants identify the benefits and challenges of developing long-term commitment to mindfulness practice. They employ various strategies, such as brief mindfulness exercises, social accountability, and guidance from teachers, to sustain their practice. While conflicted about technology, they adopt and appropriate a range of technologies in their practice for reminders, emotion tracking, connecting with others, and attending online sessions. They also carefully consider when to use technology, when and how to limit its use, and ways to incorporate technology as an object for mindfulness. Based on our findings, we discuss expanding the definition of mindfulness and the tension between supporting short- and long-term mindfulness practice. We also propose a set of design recommendations to support everyday mindfulness including such as through the lens of metaphor, reappropriating non-mindfulness technology, and bringing community support into personal practice.",

      "abstract": "People share and encounter a range of posts on social media that depict different career experiences, such as one’s successes or failures. In a continually shifting world of work, observing others’ job experiences can be useful for navigating one’s own career journey. The present study applies the possible selves theory to understand how viewing people's career experiences on social media might affect viewers’ career-related expectations, hopes, and fears. From semi-structured interviews with 19 social media users with different career experiences, this study found that social media posts may facilitate functions of possible selves by 1) increasing people's awareness of new and diverse career paths and 2) motivating people in planning toward and preparing for a desired possible self. Across these functions, we found that videos were particularly beneficial for learning and uncovering life in a career and that observing others' career experiences online often evoked online social comparison. Through an affordances lens, findings also indicate that social media affordances of visibility and persistence were particularly relevant in developing and assessing career-related possible selves and sometimes strategically managed through leveraging platform algorithms. This paper brings forth empirical contributions to the possible selves theory in the digital age and highlights the significance of social media mechanisms for possible selves.",

      "abstract": "Work-nonwork balance is an important aspect of workplace well-being with associations to improved physical and mental health, job performance, and quality of life. However, realizing work-nonwork balance goals is challenging due to competing demands and limited resources within organizational and interpersonal contexts. These challenges are compounded by technologies that blur the boundaries of work and nonwork in the always-on work cultures. At an individual level, such challenges can be subsided through the effective application of self-regulation techniques, such as implementation intentions and mental contrasting (IIMC). Further supporting these techniques through reflection on personal data, we implement the idea of data-driven IIMC into a self-tracking and behavior planning system and evaluate it in a three-week between-participant study with 43 information workers who used our system for improving work-nonwork balance. We find evidence that reflection on personal data improves awareness of behavior plan compliance and rescheduling, which are important in realizing work-nonwork balance goals. We also observe the value of micro-reflection, reflection on limited data of the very recent past, for IIMC. Our findings highlight opportunities for automation in data collection and sense-making and for further exploring the role of data-driven IIMC as boundary negotiating artifacts in support of work-nonwork balance goals.",

      "abstract": "Stack Overflow (SO) is a widely recognized online question-and-answer platform for programming, which has also fostered a substantial community dedicated to machine learning (ML), providing a space for both novices and experts to exchange ideas and find solutions to ML-related problems. However, as a relative minority of this online programming platform, research has demonstrated lower engagement in the ML community, but it remains largely unexplored to understand what hinders the engagement and contribution from ML users’ perspectives. This paper presents an empirical study based on 22 hours of semi-structured interviews and 131 survey responses with users on SO and reveals the key factors that may lead to the lower response rate and extended waiting time for ML questions on SO, which includes the unique quality requirement for posting ML questions, the discrepancy between time invested and benefits gained, the dispersed nature of the ML community across various platforms and the desired improvement for SO. Moreover, the qualitative study reveals a declining friendliness in SO’s culture over time; the subsequent quantitative study corroborates that newcomers frequently encounter stress when posting and answering ML questions, even though this stress diminishes with increased experience. Additionally, we also explored the potential influence of generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) on online question-and-answer platforms, specifically focusing on ML Q&A. We hope the results of this study can pave the way for enhancing the experience of ML users on online platforms, ultimately facilitating improved knowledge exchange and collaboration within the ML domain.",

Yet, as makerspaces increasingly use social technologies to connect members online, such technological adoption is often incongruent with the unique needs of creative entrepreneurs such as safeguarding their reputation and intellectual property.  In this paper, we describe a multi-year partnership with a local feminist makerspace to design a social platform, called Peerdea, which centered creative entrepreneurs' needs such that online feedback and information exchange, and goal setting and accountability were more readily available to them. Through an iterative, community-collaborative approach with 46 creative entrepreneurs, we report on the kinds of peer support entrepreneurs sought on Peerdea such as feedback on in-progress and unpolished work. We argue that by aligning the platform's design with the makerspace's community of practice, Peerdea leveraged the relationship and trust building which occurs more readily in-person for entrepreneurs. In addition, we highlight the role of a community mediator who actively managed the relationships between researchers and entrepreneurs, surfaced failures and championed successes, and overall provided a critical link for co-design when participants' livelihoods were implicated.",

CSCW researchers have shown the potential for collaborative technologies to support and augment care collaboration between patients and caregivers. However, as a field CSCW lacks a holistic, \\textit{theory-driven} understanding of how collaborative technologies might best augment and support the family caregiving circle as a socio-technical system.  In this paper, we report findings from interviews with 14 parents of children with cancer admitted for extended hospitalizations. We use the resilience-based Family Adaptive Systems framework from family therapy as a lens to characterize their challenges and practices across four key subsystems: Emotion, Control, Meaning, and Maintenance. Then, we introduce a fifth system—the Information system—and draw on our empirical findings to suggest theory-driven opportunities for designing future collaborative technology to augment collaborative caregiving and enhance family resilience.",

As a typical complex sociotechnical system, an OSS project often forms a hierarchical social structure where a few developers are elite while the rest are non-elite. Differences in social status may result in distinct language use behaviors in interpersonal communication. Characterizing such behaviors is critical for supporting efficient and effective communication among developers with different social statuses. This study empirically compared elite and non-elite developers' language behaviors in their communication. We compiled a corpus of ~216,000 discourses collected from 20 large projects on GitHub. We investigated the linguistic differences in three aspects, namely, linguistic styles and characters, main concerns, and sentence patterns. Our findings reveal that elite and non-elite developers showed different linguistic patterns and had different concerns in their discourses. Their discourses also reflect the variation of the main focuses in the development process. Furthermore, elite and non-elite developers exhibited noticeable patterns in their linguistic behaviors in accordance with their roles and corresponding divisions of labor in the production process, no matter which semantic contexts. These findings provide implications for supporting communication that crosses social statuses in OSS development.",

      "abstract": "Despite the growing interest in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for content analysis, current studies have primarily focused on text-based content. In the present work, we explored the potential of LLMs in assisting video content analysis by conducting a case study that followed a new workflow of LLM-assisted multimodal content analysis. The workflow encompasses codebook design, prompt engineering, LLM processing, and human evaluation. We strategically crafted annotation prompts to get LLM Annotations in structured form and explanation prompts to generate LLM Explanations for a better understanding of LLM reasoning and transparency. To test LLM's video annotation capabilities, we analyzed 203 keyframes extracted from 25 YouTube short videos about depression. We compared the LLM Annotations with those of two human coders and found that LLM has higher accuracy in object and activity Annotations than emotion and genre Annotations. Moreover, we identified the potential and limitations of LLM's capabilities in annotating videos. Based on the findings, we explore opportunities and challenges for future research and improvements to the workflow. We also discuss ethical concerns surrounding future studies based on LLM-assisted video analysis.",

Marginalized social media users face disproportionate content moderation and removal on social media platforms. We conducted a qualitative interview study (n = 24) to understand how marginalized social media users may create folk theories in response to content moderation and their perceptions of platforms’ spirit, and how these theories may relate to their marginalized identities. We found that marginalized social media users develop folk theories informed by their perceptions of platforms’ spirit to explain instances where their content was moderated in ways that violate their perceptions of how content moderation should work in practice. These folk theories typically address content being removed despite not violating community guidelines, along with bias against marginalized users embedded in guidelines. We provide implications for platforms, such as using marginalized users’ folk theories as tools to identify elements of platform moderation systems that function incorrectly and disproportionately impact marginalized users.",

We developed the Online Identity Help Center (OIHC) to confront this challenge by providing information on social media users' rights, summarizing platforms' policies, and providing instructions to appeal moderation decisions. We discuss our findings from interviews (n = 24) and surveys (n = 75) which informed the OIHC's design, along with interviews about and usability tests of the site (n = 12). We found that the OIHC's resources made it easier for participants to understand platforms' policies and access appeal resources. Participants expressed increased willingness to read platforms' policies after reading the OIHC's summarized versions, but expressed mistrust of platforms after reading them. We discuss the study's implications, such as the benefits of providing summarized policies to encourage digital literacy, and how doing so may enable users to express skepticism of platforms' policies after reading them.",

This study documents and explores the direct experiences of marginalized creators who have been impacted by discriminatory content moderation on Instagram. Collaborating with our participants for over a year, we contribute five co-constructed narratives of discriminatory content moderation from advocates in trauma-informed care, LGBTQ+ sex education, anti-racism education, and beauty and body politics. In sharing these detailed personal accounts, not only do we shed light on their experiences with being blocked, banned, or deleted unfairly, but we delve deeper into the lasting impacts of these experiences to their livelihoods and mental health. Reflecting on their stories, we observe that content moderation on social media is deeply entangled with the situated experiences of offline discrimination. As such, we document how each participant experiences moderation through the lens of their often intersectional identities.  Using participatory research methods, we collectively strategize ways to learn from these individual accounts and resist discriminatory content moderation, as well as imagine possibilities for repair and accountability.",

      "abstract": "Heritage is a dynamic concept, being constantly redefined by those that value it. Modern approaches to heritage bring focus to participatory processes that put communities at the centre of the heritage discourse. For migrant communities, these participatory processes can show the tension of integration versus identity, as migrants integrating into their host country can maintain, adapt or loose connections to their cultural identity. Digital storytelling platforms can offer space for exposing such tensions. In this paper, storytelling is adopted as a practice to engage three communities of migrants (with different socio-cultural contexts) on their relation to heritage. Through workshops, participants created 78 stories (accessible through a Digital Storytelling platform), which were thematically analysed. Using the concept of boundary objects, we discuss how participant's stories reflect heritage discourse and how they are entangled within the wider social, economic, and environmental context.",

Gaining faith-sensitive insights into the expression, participation, and inter-religious interactions on social media can greatly contribute to CSCW's literature on online safety and interfaith communication. In pursuit of this goal, we conducted a six-month-long, interview-based study with the Hindu, Buddhist, and Indigenous communities in Bangladesh. Our study draws on an extensive body of research encompassing the spiral of silence, the cultural politics of fear, and communication accommodation to examine how social media use by religious minorities is influenced by fear, which is associated with social conformity, misinformation, stigma, stereotypes, and South Asian postcolonial memory. Moreover, we engage with scholarly perspectives from religious studies, justice, and South Asian violence, offering important critical insights and design lessons for the CSCW literature on public deliberation, justice, and interfaith communication concerning religious minorities.",

      "abstract": "WhatsApp groups have become a hotbed for the propagation of harmful content including misinformation, hate speech, polarizing content, and rumors, especially in Global South countries. Given the platform's end-to-end encryption, moderation responsibilities lie on group admins and members, who rarely contest such content. Another approach is fact-checking, which is unscalable, and can only contest factual content (e.g., misinformation) but not subjective content (e.g., hate speech). Drawing on recent literature, we explore deliberation---open and inclusive discussion---as an alternative. We investigate the role of a conversational agent in facilitating deliberation on harmful content in WhatsApp groups. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 Indian WhatsApp users, employing a design probe to showcase an example agent. Participants expressed the need for anonymity and recommended AI assistance to reduce the effort required in deliberation. They appreciated the agent's neutrality but pointed out the futility of deliberation in echo chamber groups. Our findings highlight design tensions for such an agent, including privacy versus group dynamics and freedom of speech in private spaces. We discuss the efficacy of deliberation using deliberative theory as a lens, compare deliberation with moderation and fact-checking, and provide design recommendations for future such systems. Ultimately, this work advances CSCW by offering insights into designing deliberative systems for combating harmful content in private group chats on social media.",

      "abstract": "Although methods for repairing prior turns in natural conversation are critical for enabling mutual understanding, or successful communication \\cite{schegloff1977preference}, these methods are seldom built into conversational user interfaces systematically. Chatbots and voice assistants tend to ask users to paraphrase what they said if it was not understood, but users cannot do the same if they encounter trouble in understanding what the agent said. Understanding is a one-way street in most (intent-based) conversation-like interfaces. An exception to this is Moore and Arar \\cite{moore2019conversational}, who demonstrate nine types of user-initiated repair \\textit{on agent responses} that are common in natural conversation and who have shown that users will employ these repair features correctly in text-based interfaces if taught \\cite{moore2023ibm}. In this small-scale study, we test these user-initiated repairs (in second position) in a voice-based interface. With understanding-oriented repairs, we found that participants employed them much the same way in text and voice. In addition, we examine some hearing- and speaking-oriented repairs that emerged from the use of our novel multi-modal interface. We found that participants used them to manage troubles specific to the voice modality. Analysis of user logs and transcripts suggests that user-initiated repair features are valuable components of conversational interfaces.",

However, peer assessment often needs help with problems such as the lack of reliability, transparency, fairness, grading speed, and motivation to participate among students. The literature suggests several principles that each partly address the said issues. We propose a novel decentralized approach to academic peer assessment, using blockchain as an underlying technology, to address the principal problems in traditional peer assessment. We also derive design concepts for a modern courseware (CW) application consisting of our method and apply them to implement our approach in a CW called Blockment. We test the effectiveness of our method and system by running quantitative and qualitative experiments, proving our claims of improving reliability, transparency, fairness, grading speed, and motivation of grades in peer assessment. The results suggest embedding our method and system in academic courses to improve conventional peer grading methods.",

Teachers have to spend substantial time reading the answers and inferring students' learning outcomes. We present TreeQuestion, a human-in-the-loop system designed to help teachers create a set of multiple-choice questions to assess students' conceptual learning outcomes. When a teacher seeks to assess students' comprehension of specific concepts, TreeQuestion taps into the wealth of knowledge embedded within large language models and generates a set of multiple-choice questions organized in a tree-like structure. We evaluated TreeQuestion with 96 students and 10 teachers. Results indicated that students achieved similar performance in multiple-choice questions generated by TreeQuestion and open-ended questions graded by teachers. Meanwhile, TreeQuestion could reduce teachers' efforts in creating and grading the multiple-choice questions in contrast to manually generated open-ended questions. We estimate that in a hypothetical class with 20 students, using multiple-choice questions from TreeQuestion may require only 4.6% of the time compared to open-ended questions for assessing learning outcomes.",

Subgoal labels are multi-level in nature and based on goal structures that define the hierarchical functional units in code. Data-driven methods and experts can supply the goal structures, but they do not work in environments with scarce data and limited availability of experts. Previous research has shown that learnersourcing is effective for sourcing high-quality subgoal labels of given goal structures. We extend this research by learnersourcing goal structures themselves, thereby making the generation of subgoal-labeled materials fully learner-driven. We introduce CodeTree, a system that generates multi-level goal structures by aggregating learner-generated subgoals from two subgoal learning activities�Generation and Selection. In a between-subjects study, 45 novices studied three code examples with either CodeTree or code explanations alone. The results showed that CodeTree could learnersource high-quality goal structures and subgoal labels for all three examples with just five learners. Learners reported a significantly higher learning gain and satisfaction compared to the baseline.",

      "abstract": "Trust is crucial for the functioning of complex societies, and an important concern for CSCW. Our purpose is to use research from philosophy, social science, and CSCW to provide a novel account of trust in the `post-truth' era. Testimony, from one speaker to another, underlies many social systems. Epistemic trust, or testimonial credibility, is the likelihood to accept a speaker's claim due to beliefs about their competence or sincerity. Epistemic trust is closely related to several `pathological epistemic phenomena': democratic (il)legitimacy, the spread of misinformation, and echo chambers. To the best of our knowledge, this theoretical contribution is novel in the field of social computing. We further argue that epistemic trust is no philosophical novelty: it is measurable. Weakly supervised text classification approaches achieve $F_1$ scores of around 80 to 85 per cent on detecting epistemic distrust. This is also, to the best of our knowledge, a novel task in natural language processing. We measure expressions of epistemic distrust across 954 political communities on Reddit. We find that expressions of epistemic distrust are relatively rare, although there are substantial differences between communities. Conspiratorial communities and those focused on controversial political topics tend to express more distrust. Communities with strong epistemic norms enforced by moderation are likely to express low levels. While we find users to be an important potential source of contagion of epistemic distrust, community norms appear to dominate. It is likely that epistemic trust is more useful as an aggregated risk factor. Finally, we argue that policymakers should be aware of epistemic trust considering their reliance on legitimacy underwritten by testimony.",

      "abstract": "Design activism is a way for designers and researchers to negotiate societal inequities and resulting implications for design practices. Within HCI and design, community-based methods are a common way to situate design engagements among those directly impacted by social inequities. Despite its potential for social impact, current approaches to design activism can be extractive and at odds with community-aligned advocacy. Drawing on interviews with 32 individuals who use design to address local, social inequities, we extend the current discourse around design activism by exploring `activist-led design'. We outline four key considerations of this work: understanding activist-led design practices; relationality and community engagements; challenges of doing this work; and democratizing access to design. Our analysis highlights implications for academia's role in design activism. This paper interrogates design activism’s role as a social and communal practice, and considers ways to support activist-led design. We propose considerations that contribute to the larger conversation of academic design having more equitable impact.",

      "abstract": "Developing interventions that successfully reduce engagement with misinformation on social media is challenging. One intervention that has recently gained great attention is X/Twitter's Community Notes (previously known as \"Birdwatch\"). Community Notes is a crowdsourced fact-checking approach that allows users to write textual notes to inform others about potentially misleading posts on X/Twitter. Yet, empirical evidence regarding its effectiveness in reducing engagement with misinformation on social media is missing. In this paper, we perform a large-scale empirical study to analyze whether the introduction of the Community Notes feature and its roll-out to users in the U. S. and around the world have reduced engagement with misinformation on X/Twitter in terms of retweet volume and likes. We employ Difference-in-Differences (DiD) models and Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to analyze a comprehensive dataset consisting of all fact-checking notes and corresponding source tweets since the launch of Community Notes in early 2021. Although we observe a significant increase in the volume of fact-checks carried out via Community Notes, particularly for tweets from verified users with many followers, we find no evidence that the introduction of Community Notes significantly reduced engagement with misleading tweets on X/Twitter. Rather, our findings suggest that Community Notes might be too slow to effectively reduce engagement with misinformation in the early (and most viral) stage of diffusion. Our work emphasizes the importance of evaluating fact-checking interventions in the field and offers important implications to enhance crowdsourced fact-checking strategies on social media.",

      "abstract": "An Echo Chamber on social media refers to the environment where like-minded people hear the echo of each others' voices, opinions, or beliefs, which reinforce their own. \nEcho Chambers can turn social media platforms into collaborative venues that polarize and radicalize users rather than broadening their exposure to diverse information. \nHaving a quantified metric for measuring the Echo Chamber effect can aid moderators and policymakers in tracking and mitigating online polarization and radicalization. Existing methods for Echo Chamber detection are either one-dimensional, only considering the network behavior of users while ignoring their semantic behavior, or require demanding supervised labeling, which is both expensive and less generalizable.\n\nThis paper proposes a new metric to quantify the Echo Chamber effect using Transformer models for context-sensitive processing of natural language (NLP). \nOur metric quantifies (1) the effect of an Echo Chamber through the inverse effect of user diversity, and (2) polarization by means of user separability between two Echo Chambers in a topic. Leveraging this metric, we further propose an NLP-based embedding that represents the users' activity. Our model is simultaneously effective, computationally cheap, and unsupervised. As our method is unsupervised, it makes existing collaborative moderation efforts to thwart Echo Chamber effects more efficient by addressing the problem of identifying narrow information bases for algorithmic biases and misinformation detection. We run our analysis on three recent highly controversial political topics and a non-controversial topic: Russo-Ukrainian War, Abortion, Gun-Control, and SXSW music festival. Our results offer data-driven findings such as a higher Echo Chamber effect among Republicans over Democrats and diverse explicit support for Ukraine, especially among Democrats. We also observe a direct relationship between the Echo Chamber effect and polarization while observing that the low Echo Chamber effect for the Russo-Ukraine war is accompanied by a low polarization; and vice versa for Gun-Control.",

      "abstract": "``Subversive AI'' (SAI) image filters employ adversarial machine learning techniques to protect users from facial recognition by distorting personal images in ways that confuse computer vision algorithms. While novel and of significant research interest, SAI filters are presently only evaluated in terms of attack efficacy; there is no simple way to measure user acceptability of filter outputs and, thus, researchers do not consider user acceptability when making advances. We addressed this limitation by creating and validating a scale to measure user acceptance --- the SAIA-8. In a three-step process, we apply a mixed-methods approach that closely adhered to best practices for scale creation and validation in measurement theory. Initially, to understand the factors that influence user acceptance of SAI filter outputs, we interviewed 15 participants. Interviewees disliked SAI filter outputs because of a perceived lack of usefulness and conflicts with their desired self-presentation. Using insights and statements from the interviews we generated 106 potential items for the scale. Employing an iterative process with 215 crowd-sourced participants, we arrived at the eight items that comprise the SAIA-8. Finally, through a convergent validity study with 30 participants, we found that the SAIA-8 is suitable for measuring user acceptability of privacy-enhancing image perturbations. Moreover, it can aid in prioritizing user acceptability when developing and evaluating new SAI filters.",

      "abstract": "Moderating online spaces effectively is not a matter of simply taking down content: moderators also provide private feedback and defuse situations before they cross the line into harm. However, moderators have little tool support for these activities, which often occur in the backchannel rather than in front of the entire community. In this paper, we introduce Chillbot, a moderation tool for Discord designed to facilitate backchanneling from moderators to users. With Chillbot, moderators gain the ability to send rapid anonymous feedback responses to situations where removal or formal punishment is too heavy-handed to be appropriate, helping educate users about how to improve their behavior while avoiding direct confrontations that can put moderators at risk. We evaluated Chillbot through a two week field deployment on eleven Discord servers ranging in size from 25 to over 240,000 members. Moderators in these communities used Chillbot more than four hundred times during the study, and moderators from six of the eleven servers continued using the tool past the end of the formal study period. Based on this deployment, we describe implications for the design of a broader variety of means by which moderation tools can help shape communities' norms and behavior.",

      "abstract": "AI regulations are expected to prohibit machine learning models from using sensitive attributes during training. However, the latest Natural Language Processing (NLP) classifiers, which rely on deep learning, operate as black-box systems, complicating the detection and remediation of such misuse. Traditional bias mitigation methods in NLP aim for comparable performance across different groups based on attributes like gender or race but fail to address the underlying issue of reliance on protected attributes. To partly fix that, we introduce NLPGuard, a framework for mitigating the reliance on protected attributes in NLP classifiers. NLPGuard takes an unlabeled dataset, an existing NLP classifier, and its training data as input, producing a modified training dataset that significantly reduces dependence on protected attributes without compromising accuracy. NLPGuard is applied to three classification tasks: identifying toxic language, sentiment analysis, and occupation classification. Our evaluation shows that current NLP classifiers heavily depend on protected attributes, with up to 23% of the most predictive words associated with these attributes. However, NLPGuard effectively reduces this reliance by up to 79%, while slightly improving accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Content creation today often takes place via collaborative writing. A longstanding interest of CSCW research lies in understanding and promoting the coordination between co-writers. However, little attention has been paid to individuals who write in their non-native language and to co-writer groups involving them. We present a mixed-method study that fills the above gap. Our participants included 32 co-writer groups, each consisting of one native speaker (NS) of English and one non-native speaker (NNS) with limited proficiency. They performed collaborative writing adopting two different workflows: half of the groups began with NNSs taking the first editing turn and half had NNSs act after NSs. Our data revealed a “late-mover disadvantage” exclusively experienced by NNS: an NNS’s ideational contributions to the joint document were suppressed when their editing turn was placed after an NS’s turn, as opposed to ahead of it. Surprisingly, editing help provided by AI-powered tools did not exempt NNSs from being disadvantaged. Instead, it triggered NSs’ overestimation of NNSs’ English proficiency and agency displayed in the writing, introducing unintended tensions into the collaboration. These findings shed light on the fair assessment and effective promotion of a co-writer’s contributions in language diverse settings. In particular, they underscore the necessity of disentangling contributions made to the ideational, expressional, and lexical aspects of the joint writing.",

      "abstract": "Online mental health support communities have grown in recent years for providing accessible mental and emotional health support through volunteer counselors. Despite millions of people participating in chat support on these platforms, the clinical effectiveness of these communities on mental health symptoms remains unknown. Furthermore, although volunteers receive some training based on established therapeutic skills studied in face-to-face environments such as active listening and motivational interviewing, it remains understudied how the usage of these skills in this online context affects people's mental health status. In our work, we collaborate with one of the largest online peer support platforms and use both natural language processing and machine learning techniques to measure how one-on-one support chats affect depression and anxiety symptoms. We measure how the techniques and characteristics of support providers, such as using affirmation, empathy, and past experience on the platform, affect support-seekers’ mental health changes. We find that online peer support chats improve both depression and anxiety symptoms with a statistically significant but relatively small effect size. Additionally, support providers' techniques such as emphasizing the autonomy of the client lead to better mental health outcomes. However, we also found that some behaviors (e.g. persuading) are actually harmful to depression and anxiety outcomes. Our work provides key understanding for mental health care in the online setting and designing training systems for online support providers.",

      "abstract": "Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are an essential part of the global economy and paramount to local communities and employment markets. They are also considered to be particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks as they lack technical competencies, strict controls, and organizational routines. We present the results of an ethnographic study of 30 SMEs in Denmark to further our understanding of how companies in this segment handle cybersecurity in their daily practices. We suggest that cybersecurity is dealt with as a mundane art: instead of striving for solutions, SMEs must leave things undone, endure partially broken systems, and resort to making things slightly better or worse but never good. In line with CSCW scholarship on care in broken worlds, we emphasize the various tactics of living with insecure technologies. In a broken world, securing is often not about assurance or following rules but about handling dilemmas, breaking things a little but not a lot, or waiting things out.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a comparative legislative analysis that critically examines the precursors and implementation of online safety legislation on societies in the Global South, using the Caribbean as a focal case study. The online communities that we engage with foster greater human connections, serve as platforms to promote business services, and have become central in public discourse worldwide. Consequently, governance has emerged as a vital approach to maintain healthy digital environments and address the rise of socio-technical harms flowing from online communities. This study employs a two-tiered analytical approach to scrutinize the legislative frameworks established in the Caribbean and to surface variations in policy priorities, approaches to regulation, levels of enforcement, and identify power dynamics that impact the execution of said regulation. The findings of this work shed light on the need for additional work in social computing that delves into the societal ramifications of existing governance structures, rather than solely focusing on efforts to inform and develop new legislation. Through the lens of the Caribbean's case study, this paper provides valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in the region seeking to optimize the impact of online safety laws on their societies while highlighting contextually appropriate governance solutions that acknowledge the unique cultural, political, and socioeconomic contexts of the Global South.",

      "abstract": "E-commerce marketplaces provide business opportunities to millions of sellers worldwide. Some of these sellers have special relationships with the marketplace by virtue of using their subsidiary services (e.g., fulfillment and/or shipping services provided by the marketplace) -- we refer to such sellers collectively as \\textit{Related Sellers}. When multiple sellers offer to sell the same product, the marketplace helps a customer in selecting an offer (by a seller) through (a)~a default offer selection algorithm, (b)~showing features about each of the offers and the corresponding sellers (price, seller performance metrics, seller's number of ratings etc.), and (c)~finally evaluating the sellers along these features. In this paper, we perform an end-to-end investigation into how the above apparatus can nudge customers toward the \\textit{Related Sellers} on Amazon's four different marketplaces in India, USA, Germany and France. We find that given explicit choices, customers' preferred offers and algorithmically selected offers can be significantly different. We highlight that Amazon is adopting different performance metric evaluation policies for different sellers, potentially benefiting \\textit{Related Sellers}. For instance, such policies result in notable discrepancy between the actual performance metric and the presented performance metric of \\textit{Related Sellers}. \nWe further observe that among the seller-centric features visible to customers, sellers' number of ratings influences their decisions the most, yet it may not reflect the true quality of service by the seller, rather reflecting the scale at which the seller operates, thereby implicitly steering customers toward larger \\textit{Related Sellers}. Moreover, when customers are shown the rectified metrics for the different sellers, their preference toward \\textit{Related Sellers} is almost halved.\nWe believe our findings will inform and encourage further deliberation toward more effective governance of such design choices and policies adopted by e-commerce marketplaces.",

Mobile phones, particularly mHealth applications, can potentially improve youth’s management of this chronic condition.  However, the design of these services rarely accounts for users in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this paper, we investigate factors that influence the use of mobile phones for managing T1D among youth in rural and urban Kenya. Our analysis draws from 58 interviews conducted with T1D youth (between the ages of 11 and 18 years old), their caregivers, and other significant stakeholders, including doctors and schoolteachers. Our findings draw attention to a significant mismatch between the mobile phone features prioritized in mHealth apps and participants’ usage practices. We discuss the practical implications of these findings for mHealth design and user research.",

      "abstract": "In early December 2022, China's zero-COVID policy came to an end. For Chinese citizens, an imaginary of safety predicated on collective action and state care was replaced with a general focus on individualized responsibility for maintaining one's health. This expedited policy reversal had the unintended effect of infecting around 80% of China’s population in one month, leading to a period of confusion, anxiety, and infection. One way of obtaining safety in a precarious time was to acquire medical resources. Through an online ethnographic investigation, we trace the acquisition of Paxlovid, an antiviral medication that had its distribution within China complicated by geopolitical tension and supply issues. By attending to the precarity of Chinese citizens at home and abroad, we show how Paxlovid was desired in both the present tense for the presently ill and in the future tense as an anticipatory form of safety. We use the analytical lens of anticipation work to unpack individual, collective, and state anticipatory practices supported by various social media platforms within and across borders. In doing so, we highlight moments of friction between and among various actors to argue that attending to affect, precarity, and practices in moments of conflict is critical to understanding the complexities of computer-supported cooperative work.",

      "abstract": "The QAnon movement has been credited with spreading disinformation and fueling online radicalization in the United States and around the globe. While some research has documented publicly-visible communications and engagements with the QAnon movement, little work has examined individuals’ actual exposure to QAnon content. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which Americans are exposed to QAnon websites, in what contexts, and to what effect. We employ a mixed methods review of 21 million website visits collected from a nationally representative sample of 1,238 American adults across laptops, smartphones, and tablets during the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Quantitative techniques reveal overall levels of exposure to QAnon and who is more likely to be exposed, and qualitative techniques provide rich information about how participants came to be exposed to QAnon and how it fit within their broader media diets. We find that: (1) exposure to QAnon websites is limited and stratified by political ideology and news consumption; (2) exposure tends to occur within right-wing media ecosystems that align with QAnon beliefs; and (3) mixed methods approaches to analyzing digital trace data can provide rich insights that contextualize quantitative techniques. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of interventions to lessen exposure to problematic material online and future research on the spread of disinformation and extremist content.",

      "abstract": "Social media personalization algorithms increasingly influence the flow of civic information through society, resulting in concerns about \"filter bubbles'', \"echo chambers'', and other ways they might exacerbate ideological segregation and fan the spread of polarizing content. To address these concerns, we designed and conducted a sociotechnical audit (STA) to investigate how Twitter/X's timeline algorithm affects news curation while also tracking how user perceptions change in response. We deployed a custom-built system that, over the course of three weeks, passively tracked all tweets loaded in users' browsers in the first week, then in the second week enacted an intervention to users' Twitter/X homepage to restrict their view to only the algorithmic or chronological timeline (randomized). We flipped this condition for each user in the third week. We ran our audit in late 2023, collecting user-centered metrics (self-reported survey measures) and platform-centered metrics (views, clicks, likes) for 243 users, along with over 800,000 tweets. Using the STA framework, our results are two-fold: (1) Our algorithm audit finds that Twitter/X's algorithmic timeline resulted in a lower quantity but higher quality of news --- less ideologically congruent, less extreme, and slightly more reliable --- compared to the chronological timeline. (2) Our user audit suggests that although our timeline intervention had significant effects on users' behaviors, it had little impact on their overall perceptions of the platform. Our paper discusses these findings and their broader implications in the context of algorithmic news curation, user-centric audits, and avenues for independent social science research.",

In our study, we leverage mental maps to explore migrants' ''sense of place''. We conduct a mixed-methods study with 12 participants, spanning two sessions — one before and one after their relocation, totaling 24 data sessions. We discover that post-relocation, mental maps not only widen coverage and generalization but also decrease in cartographic complexity and accuracy, reflecting a nuanced blend of personal narratives and spatial awareness. We also find that strategies for rebuilding and reshaping ''sense of place'' span a complex set of dimensions spanning personal, social and environmental challenges, post-move. Our findings lay the groundwork, and underscore the need, for ''platial'' (versus spatial) understanding and tools to rebuild sense of place, and foster better community cohesion. We highlight design opportunities for creating tools, especially those capturing personal nuances, to help migrants reestablish themselves and their sense of place.",

      "abstract": "Research suggests that automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, which automatically convert speech to text, show different performances according to various input classes (e.g., accent, age), requiring attention to building fairer AI systems that would perform similarly across various input classes. However, would an AI system with the same performance regardless of input classes really be perceived as fair enough? To this end, we investigate how listeners perceive the ASR system of the same result differently according to whether the speaker is a native speaker (NS) or a non-native speaker (NNS), which may lead to unfair situations. We conducted a study (n = 420), where participants were given one of the ten speech recordings with various accents of the same script along with the same captions. We found that even with the same ASR output, listeners perceive the ASR results differently. They found captions to be more useful for NNS's speech and blamed NNS more for the errors than NS. Based on the findings, we present design implications suggesting that we should take a step further than just achieving the same performance across various input classes to build a fair ASR system.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the interplay between identity, collective action, and digital marketplaces among Latino house-cleaners in Toronto. Domestic work, such as house-cleaning, has traditionally been devalued, gendered, and delegated to marginalised immigrant populations. The informal nature of house-cleaning work, also introduces precarity, vulnerabilities and potential avenues of exploitation. Drawing on 19 interviews with Latino house-cleaners, the paper underscores how identity shapes experiences and strategies in the labour markets. We find that Latino house-cleaners prefer to use asynchronous digital marketplaces, such as social media commerce groups and online classified advertisement websites, as the platforms provides flexibility and control over their labour outcomes. The paper further delves into how group identities online - such as being Latino and women - foster collective action and solidarity. The paper provides insights on how we can support the needs  support the challenges and needs of immigrant domestic workers in technology-mediated labour markets.",

      "abstract": "The Latinx diaspora in the United States is a rapidly growing and complex demographic who face intersectional harms and marginalizations in sociotechnical systems and are currently underserved in CSCW research. While the field understands that algorithms and digital content are experienced differently by marginalized populations, more investigation is needed about how Latinx people experience social media and, in particular, visual media. In this paper, we focus on how Latinx people experience the algorithmic system of the video-sharing platform TikTok. Through a bilingual interview and visual elicitation study of 19 Latinx TikTok users and 59 survey participants, we explore how Latinx individuals experience TikTok and its Latinx content. We find Latinx TikTok users actively use platform affordances to create positive and affirming identity content feeds, but these feeds are interrupted by negative content (i.e. violence, stereotypes, linguistic assumptions) due to platform affordances that have unique consequences for Latinx diaspora users. We discuss these implications on Latinx identity and representation, introduce the concept of algorithmic identity compression, where sociotechncial systems simplify, flatten, and conflate intersection identities, resulting in compression via the loss of critical cultural data deemed unnecessary by these systems and designers of them. This study explores how Latinx individuals are particularly vulnerable to this in sociotechnical systems, such as, but not limited to, TikTok.",

We turn to citizen science to reimagine data work, highlighting collaborative relationships between citizen science project managers and volunteers. Though citizen science and traditional crowd work entail similar forms of data work, such as classifying or transcribing large data sets, citizen science relies on volunteer contributions rather than paid data work. We detail the work of project managers running citizen science projects that shaped volunteer experiences: aligning science goals, minimizing barriers to participation, engaging communities, communicating with volunteers, providing training and education, rewarding contributions, and reflecting on volunteer work. These management strategies created opportunities for meaningful work by cultivating intrinsic motivation and fostering collaborative work relationships but ultimately limited participation to specific data related tasks. We recommend management tactics and task design strategies for creating meaningful work for invisible collar workers, an understudied class of labor in CSCW.",

We examine how conflicts within the community over the rise of corporate participation in OSM provided a stage for the articulation and enactment of community values, shedding light on the broader dynamics and trajectory of the platform and its participants. The contributions of this work include reflections on how increasing corporate participation in OSM intersects with discourses about the emancipatory potential of emerging mapping technologies, insights into the challenges of scaling membership in peer production communities, and exploring the role of values in understanding the social life and governance of online communities.",

A lack of details surrounding pilot studies in crowdsourcing research hinders the replication of studies and the reproduction of findings, stalling potential scientific advances. We conducted a systematic literature review on the current state of pilot study reporting at the intersection of crowdsourcing and HCI research. Our review of ten years of literature included 171~articles published in the proceedings of the Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (AAAI HCOMP) and the ACM Digital Library. We found that pilot studies in crowdsourcing research (i.e., crowd pilot studies) are often under-reported in the literature. Important details, such as the number of workers and rewards to workers, are often not reported. On the basis of our findings, we reflect on the current state of practice and formulate a set of best practice guidelines for reporting crowd pilot studies in crowdsourcing research. We also provide implications for the design of crowdsourcing platforms and make practical suggestions for supporting crowd pilot study reporting.",

Prevention practice and research on GBV contend with an incomplete understanding of its public health burden due to gender-exclusive definitions of GBV and inhibited survivor disclosure. Prior work in CSCW and HCI has explored sensitive disclosures and GBV conversations but excludes examination of conversation dynamics in surfacing knowledge of GBV. We used a mixed-methods approach to understand the phenomenon characterized by Muted Group Theory as a mechanism inhibiting disclosure in the context of GBV discussions on Reddit. Using an iterative process informed by literature on GBV research on cis-gender women, girls, trans, and non-binary populations, we developed comprehensive keywords to obtain, annotate, and analyze $298$ posts and $10,369$ comments about GBV across 7 subreddits. We found that muting faced by survivors offline, precluding reporting, is replicated on the Reddit platform. This study surfaced 5 categories of muting in discussions of GBV situated by variations in communication norms between dominant and non-dominant groups. These findings were supported by analysis of linguistic attributes that inform an Ensemble Classifier's detection of muting in conversations of GBV. The results offer that muting is a harmful occurrence in online disclosures of GBV that is mediated by existing moderation practices. This work contributes an expanded understanding of GBV conversations online, muting as a feature of those conversations, and an initial foray into detection to inform muting prevention.",

To address this, we investigate a co-design method, Matchmaking for AI, to enable fact-checkers, designers, and NLP researchers to collaboratively identify what fact-checker needs should be addressed by technology, and to brainstorm ideas for potential solutions. Co-design sessions we conducted with 22 professional fact-checkers yielded a set of 11 design ideas that offer a \"north star\", integrating fact-checker criteria into novel NLP design concepts. These concepts range from pre-bunking misinformation, efficient and personalized monitoring misinformation, proactively reducing fact-checker potential biases, and collaborative writing fact-check reports. Our work provides new insights into both human-centered fact-checking research and practice and AI co-design research.",

      "abstract": "Human-AI collaborative decision-making can achieve better outcomes than either party individually. The success of this collaboration can depend on whether the human decision-maker perceives the AI contribution as beneficial to the decision-making process. Beneficial AI explanations are often described as relevant, convincing, and trustworthy. Yet, we know little about the characteristics of explanations that result in these perceptions. Focusing on collaborative subjective decision-making, using the context of subtle sexism, where explanations can surface new interpretations, we conducted a user study (N=20) to explore the structural and content characteristics that affect perceptions of human- and AI-generated verbal (text and audio) explanations. We find four groups of characteristics (Tone, Grammatical Elements, Argumentative Sophistication and Relation\nto User), and that the effect of these characteristics on the perception of explanations for subtle sexism depends on the perceived author. Thus, we also identify which explanation characteristics participants use to identify the author of an explanation. Demonstrating the relationship between these characteristics and explanation perceptions, we present a categorized set of characteristics that system builders can leverage to produce the\nappropriate perception of an explanation for various sensitive contexts. We also highlight human perception biases and associated issues resulting from these perceptions",

Specifically, through a series of interviews with 23 professional fact-checkers from around the world, we validated that harm assessment is a central component of how fact-checkers triage their work. First,  we clarify what aspects of misinformation they considered to create urgency or importance. These often revolved around the potential for the claim to harm others. We also clarify the processes behind collective fact-checking decisions and gather suggestions for tools that could help with these processes. \n\nIn addition, to address the needs articulated by these fact-checkers and others, we present a five-dimension framework of questions to help fact-checkers negotiate the priority of claims. Our FABLE Framework of Misinformation Harms incorporates five dimensions of magnitude---\\textit{(social) Fragmentation}, \\textit{Actionability}, \\textit{Believability},  \\textit{Likelihood of spread}, and \\textit{Exploitativeness}---that can help determine the potential urgency of a specific message or post when considering misinformation as harm. This effort was further validated by additional interviews with expert fact-checkers. The result is a questionnaire, a practical and conceptual tool to support fact-checkers and other content moderators as they make strategic decisions to prioritize their efforts.",

      "abstract": "Homelessness is a significant and growing crisis in the United States. In an effort to more efficiently and fairly distribute limited housing resources, jurisdictions across the US have adopted algorithmic prioritization systems to help select which unhoused people should receive resources. Given the impact of algorithmic prioritization on the lives of unhoused people, there is a need to more fully examine how these systems are implemented in practice by frontline workers such as social service workers. In this paper, we present a qualitative study that draws on interviews and artifact walkthroughs with fifteen social service workers to examine how they interacted with algorithmic prioritization systems as part of their job duties. We found that social service workers employed discretionary work practices to mediate between the rigid formats of algorithmic prioritization systems and the messy, situated realities of homelessness. We term these discretionary work practices “intermediation” and provide four examples that illustrate how our interlocutors were able to maintain their commitment to advocacy and to express their expertise despite the automation of major aspects of their professional decision-making. These work practices, which we argue were motivated by care for clients, as well as a desire to preserve professional autonomy, lead us to conclude that discretion cannot easily be removed from bureaucratic systems and that removing discretion is not necessarily a desirable outcome.",

However, existing privacy research has predominantly concentrated on the individual level, paying less attention to the privacy practices and strategies adopted by online social groups. This research gap calls for a renewed focus on understanding and addressing privacy challenges specific to online group settings. In this paper we explore the privacy needs of online groups through the lens of Contextual Integrity. We perform two complementary studies: semi-structured qualitative interviews of Facebook Groups users (n=17), and a large-scale survey of individuals organizing in groups on Facebook, Discord, and Reddit (n=4486). We investigate the privacy needs of different contextual groups, and locate the presence of contextual norms, contextual member roles, explicit and implicit rules, and privacy concerns. We trace how this complex interplay informs privacy expectations, needs, and negotiations across groups. We find that technical systems provide limited tools to effectively enforce group privacy, allowing individuals to compromise privacy norms. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations to support the design of privacy controls for online groups.",

We argue that a main assumption of online group design---that groups ask nothing of their members beyond lurking---may be preventing many of these groups from sustaining a critical mass of participation. In this paper, we explore an alternative commitment design for online groups, which requires that all members commit at regular intervals to participating, as a condition of remaining in the group. We instantiate this approach in a mobile group chat platform called Commit, and perform a field study comparing commitment against a control condition of social psychological nudges with N=57 participants over three weeks. Commitment doubled the number of contributions versus the control condition, and resulted in 87% (vs. 19%) of participants remaining active by the third week. Participants reported that commitment provided safe cover for them to post even when they were nervous. Through this work, we argue that more effortful, not less effortful, membership may support many online groups.",

Specifically, this research uses communication transcripts and text analysis to complete two main research objectives. First, we extend prior research by exploring how individual traits of group members (specifically, personality, cognitive ability, and social sensitivity) are related to emerging roles in computer-mediated communication. Personal characteristics such as agreeableness, social sensitivity, and motivation were significant predictors of role emergence in online decision-making groups. Agreeableness predicted the emergence of the listener role, social sensitivity predicted the emergence of the manager role, and motivation predicted the emergence of the sharer role. Second, we answer the call for more replication research and further validate the results of Barlow [1, 2] by measuring roles assumed by individuals working synchronously online; we highlight the findings that are confirmed across previous research and our current study.",

We evaluate the usability of two secure contact exchange systems: the current state of the art, SafeSlinger, and our newly designed protocol, PairSonic, which extends trust from physical encounters to spontaneous online communication. Our lab study (N=45) demonstrates PairSonic's superior usability, automating the tedious verification tasks from previous approaches via an acoustic out-of-band channel. Although participants significantly preferred our system, minimizing user effort surprisingly decreased the perceived security for some users, who associated security with complexity. We discuss user perceptions of the different protocol components and identify remaining usability barriers for CSCW application scenarios.",

However, high-quality mortality data is typically unavailable for researchers to access in a timely manner due to bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the coordination of managing mortality data across a vast information ecosystem. To identify opportunities to improve access to mortality data, we conducted a qualitative interview study with 20 experts with direct knowledge and experience with mortality data systems. From these interviews, we mapped the mortality data ecosystem and found that policy constraints are the main underlying cause of bottlenecks and inefficiencies. We argue that policy intervention is required to optimize the coordination of mortality data between databases and between organizations. To support researcher access to mortality data, we present guiding principles for designers seeking to improve the mortality data ecosystem. These principles contribute to CSCW scholarship focused on the challenges of coordination across large information ecosystems and the tradeoffs between technology and policy when designing such systems.",

      "abstract": "Competitive gaming, a long-standing study context for CSCW, has recently faced criticism due to its design emphasis on competition and achievement, which is associated with adverse phenomena such as player toxicity and anxiety. Recognizing this limit, game designers have proactively made design attempts to ameliorate these unintended consequences of competitive gaming. A notable example is the All Random All Mid (ARAM) mode in League of Legends (LoL), designed to introduce casualness into competitive gaming. To understand how players experience both casualness and competitiveness, a seemingly contradictory pair, we conducted an interview study with ARAM players, finding that ARAM supports ‘casual competition’ through decentering competition, diversifying interpersonal dynamics, and filling gaps in player needs. We further discuss how game design and player agency co-constitute casual competition, reflect on key aspects of competitive gaming design such as diversity and fairness, and provide implications for competitive gaming design, which may help combat toxicity.",

      "abstract": "The multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre has gained significant popularity and economic success, attracting considerable research interest within the Human-Computer Interaction community. Enhancing the gaming experience requires a deep understanding of player behavior, and a crucial aspect of MOBA games is matchmaking, which aims to assemble teams of comparable skill levels. However, existing matchmaking systems often neglect important factors such as players' position preferences and team assignment, resulting in imbalanced matches and reduced player satisfaction. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework called CUPID, which introduces a novel process called ``re-matchmaking''  to optimize team and position assignments to improve both fairness and player satisfaction. CUPID incorporates a pre-filtering step to ensure a minimum level of matchmaking quality, followed by a pre-match win-rate prediction model that evaluates the fairness of potential assignments. By simultaneously considering players' position satisfaction and game fairness, CUPID aims to provide an enhanced matchmaking experience. \nExtensive experiments were conducted on two large-scale, real-world MOBA datasets to validate the effectiveness of CUPID. The results surpass all existing state-of-the-art baselines, with an average relative improvement of 7.18% in terms of win prediction accuracy. Furthermore, CUPID has been successfully deployed in a popular online mobile MOBA game. The deployment resulted in significant improvements in match fairness and player satisfaction, as evidenced by critical Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) metrics covering usability, accessibility, and engagement, observed through A/B testing.",

      "abstract": "Forming accurate mental models that align with the actual behavior of an AI system is critical for successful user experience and interactions. One way to develop mental models is through information shared by other users. However, this social information can be inaccurate and there is a lack of research examining whether inaccurate social information influences the development of accurate mental models. To address this gap, our study investigates the impact of social information accuracy on mental models, as well as whether prompting users to validate the social information can mitigate the impact. We conducted a between-subject experiment with 39 crowdworkers where each participant interacted with our AI system that automates a workflow given a natural language sentence. We compared participants' mental models between those exposed to social information of how the AI system worked, both correct and incorrect, versus those who formed mental models through their own usage of the system. Specifically, we designed three experimental conditions: 1) validation condition that presented the social information followed by an opportunity to validate its accuracy through testing example utterances, 2) social information condition that presented the social information only, without the validation opportunity, and 3) control condition that allowed users to interact with the system without any social information. Our results revealed that the inclusion of the validation process had a positive impact on the development of accurate mental models, especially around the knowledge distribution aspect of mental models. Furthermore, participants were more willing to share comments with others when they had the chance to validate the social information. The impact of inaccurate social information on altering user mental models was found to be non-significant, while 69.23% of participants incorrectly judged the social information accuracy at least once. We discuss the implications of these findings for designing tools that support the validation of social information and thereby improve human-AI interactions.",

A crucial factor for fake news to go viral on social media is that users share such content. Here, we aim to shed light on the sharing behavior of users across human-generated vs. AI-generated fake news. Specifically, we study: (1)~What is the perceived veracity of human-generated fake news vs. AI-generated fake news? (2)~What is the user's willingness to share human-generated fake news vs. AI-generated fake news on social media? (3)~What socio-economic characteristics let users fall for AI-generated fake news? To this end, we conducted a pre-registered, online experiment with $N=$ 988 subjects and 20 fake news from the COVID-19 pandemic generated by GPT-4 vs. humans. Our findings show that AI-generated fake news is perceived as less accurate than human-generated fake news, but both tend to be shared equally. Further, several socio-economic factors explain who falls for AI-generated fake news.",

      "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) auditing is a relatively new area of work. Currently, there is a lack of uniform standards and regulation. As a result, the AI auditing ecosystem is very diverse, and AI auditing professionals use a variety of different auditing methods. So far, little is known about how AI auditors approach the concept of trust in AI through AI audits, in particular regarding the trust of users. This paper reports findings from interviews with 19 AI auditing stakeholders to understand how AI auditing professionals seek to create calibrated trust in AI tools and AI audits. Themes identified included the AI auditing ecosystem, participants’ experiences with AI auditing, and trust in AI audits and AI. The paper adds to the existing research on trust in AI and trustworthiness in AI by adding perspectives of key stakeholders regarding trust in AI Audits by users as an essential and currently less explored part of the trust in AI research. This paper shows how information asymmetry in respect to AI audits can decrease the value of audits for users and consequently their trust in AI systems. Study participants suggest key elements for rebuilding trust and suggest recommendations for the AI auditing industry, such as monitoring of auditors and effective communication about AI audits.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we gather 12 workers from a large technology company, as recent participants of a research initiative on the social impact of emerging technologies, to present a collaborative analysis of the opportunities and limitations of dissensus-based approaches to technology research and design. We introduce a series of speculative and deconstructive probes and present findings from their use in four collaborative design sessions. We then draw on the theoretical tradition of Agonism to identify moments of friction, refusal, and disagreement over the course of these sessions. We contend that this approach offers a politically important alternative to consensus-based collaborative design methods and can even surface new rhetorics of contestation within discourses on technology futures. We conclude with a discussion of the importance of worker-authored research and an initial set opportunities, challenges, and paradoxes as a resource for future efforts to \"Design for Agonism.\"",

Yet, minimal work has explored how actors repair these breakdowns and how other infrastructures may interfere with repairs in such contexts. Interviewing adolescents and adults affiliated with a youth empowerment program, we used the pandemic to examine how a human infrastructure that previously facilitated a sense of community broke down and how members attempted to repair this infrastructure. While organized activities, resources, and interpersonal interactions aligned to facilitate in-person care that established a sense of community, incorporating information and communication technologies to align a sociotechnical infrastructure during social restrictions could not overcome multiple constraints imposed by other infrastructures that limited this sense of community. We discuss limitations to care and aligning together multiple disjointed infrastructures, calling for CSCW researchers to critically consider asset-based design as a methodology that might help sustain a community’s well-being.",

      "abstract": "Social computing researchers have described how online harassment is taking on more sophisticated forms where communities rather than lone individuals carry out attacks. At the same time, those who are targeted are coming together with members of the online crowd to confront this networked harassment. However, we currently lack empirical studies of how such self-organizing efforts take place, especially in non-western contexts like India. To address this gap, this paper examines two case studies of gendered Islamophobia, Sulli Deals and Bulli Bai where a group of Indian Muslim women were targeted via fake auctions hosted on GitHub, that were subsequently amplified over social media. We conducted 12 in-depth interviews with the women targeted in these incidents to understand how these women collectively made sense of these incidents, and the social and spiritual resources they drew upon as they constructed a response together. Our findings describe how our participants understood these incidents (e.g. with families and each other); the work they did to combat the harassment (e.g. coordinating a unified media response); and how religious beliefs and spiritual practices played into this (e.g. values around courage, patience, flexibility, and humility). We conclude by discussing how these findings can refresh our understanding of designing community-driven responses to networked harassment.",

      "abstract": "On June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, which has led to full bans on most abortions in 14 states within one year. Many people in the U.S. use period and fertility tracking apps for reproductive healthcare and concerns have arisen about the privacy risks these apps might pose in the wake of Roe reversal. Existing literature on privacy risks of period and fertility tracking apps has primarily examined the privacy policies and practices of these apps. However, how users make sense of the privacy risks of these apps, especially in the post-Roe time, remains understudied. This study explores collective privacy sensemaking on social media, a practice in which people collectively make sense of a privacy situation. Our findings reveal how people contextualize privacy issues, speculate about the associated risks, as well as explore risk mitigation strategies. We conclude with privacy design implications for privacy design in period and fertility tracking apps and contribute insights that could inform policymaking and legal perspectives.",

      "abstract": "Quality patient-provider communication is critical to improve clinical care and patient outcomes. While progress has been made with communication skills training for clinicians, significant gaps exist in how to best monitor, measure, and evaluate the implementation of communication skills in the actual clinical setting. Advancements in ubiquitous technology and natural language processing make it possible to realize more objective, real-time assessment of clinical interactions and in turn provide more timely feedback to clinicians about their communication effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CommSense, a computational sensing framework that combines smartwatch audio and transcripts with natural language processing methods to measure selected ''best-practice'' communication metrics captured by wearable devices in the context of palliative care interactions, including understanding, empathy, presence, emotion, and clarity. We conducted a pilot study involving N=40 clinician participants, to test the technical feasibility and acceptability of CommSense in a simulated clinical setting. Our findings demonstrate that CommSense effectively captures most communication metrics and is well-received by both practicing clinicians and student trainees. Our study also highlights the potential for digital technology to enhance communication skills training for healthcare providers and students, ultimately resulting in more equitable delivery of healthcare and accessible, lower cost tools for training with the potential to improve patient outcomes.",

This paper presents an empirical study of unemployed job seekers and the work they do in connection with upholding their everyday life, job search, technology use, and the necessary connections with the public unemployment office (job center). Within the country where the research is conducted, the activities of the unemployed involve balancing formal legal requirements and procedures (to secure unemployment benefits, etc.) with informal navigation of the rules and regulations, networks and activities directed towards employment. The activities are mediated by digital platforms, e.g. job search, accountability, documentation, and, as a consequence, job seekers largely have to depend on their technologies and experiences to manage these processes. We present a study of interviews with job seekers (n=10) with an average age of 60, and two Participatory Design workshops with a total of 15 participants. Our analysis shows that the unemployed carry out work towards fulfilling formal requirements posed by the unemployment office, as well as setting up their daily, computer-supported routines, and a significant amount of unrecognized hidden work navigating rules, status and informal networks.",

However, few studies have explored how adolescents in a pre-transition stage practice self-management and collaborative management with their parents. Through interviews with 15 adolescents (aged 15-17), we found that adolescents managed mundane self-care tasks and experimented with lifestyle changes to be more independent, which sometimes conflicted with their parents' efforts to ensure their safety. Adolescents and their parents also performed shared activities that provided adolescents with the opportunity to learn and practice self-management skills. Based on our findings, we discuss considerations for technology design to facilitate transition and promote parent-adolescent collaboration in light of these tensions.",

      "abstract": "Older adults are often underserved and marginalized in technology engagement due to their reluctance and the barriers they face in adopting and engaging with mainstream technology. However, Pinxiaoquan, a social feature of an e-commerce platform, has gained a large number of older users. This work investigates how and why Chinese older adults use Pinxiaoquan, aiming to unveil the underlying logic and inspire technology-inclusive design for older adults. To this end, we conducted a mixed-methods qualitative study over two years, including walk-through, online observation, and semi-interview, and analyzed the collected data with the grounded theory approach. We found that Pinxiaoquan's success among Chinese older adults is mainly due to its ability to inspire technological autonomy and provide social-emotional support. Rather than simply lowering technical barriers or asking them to seek assistance outside the platform, Pinxiaoquan builds a semi-acquaintance online community based on location and social ties that allows older adults to realize technical support mutually. Pinxiaoquan also fulfills their social-emotional needs, such as free online expression, memory creation and preservation, relationship expansion and maintenance, and a sense of value. Our research contributes to the HCI community by highlighting the importance of improving older adults' technology autonomy following their specific social and cultural background and social-emotional needs. This work also provides unique insights and implications for building inclusive technology for the growing aging population.",

They are significant as objects of continuity, vessels for identity, and links to past relationships and history—for individuals, families, and communities. Drawing from in-depth interviews and cultural probe sessions with 16 individuals over 65, we consider how older adults curate and interact with their personal artifacts that embody and inform memory. Participants' hands-on experiences with memory artifacts uncover a heterogeneous set of personal curation practices and identify tensions that result from the competing goals of creating a legible narrative or legacy for themselves, their family, and their communities. The transition from physical to digital memory artifacts often perpetuates tension but can also create moments of reflection. These findings contribute a set of design considerations for supporting curation practices. This paper joins and expands upon CSCW scholarship regarding the importance of memory artifacts and the ongoing challenges of retaining individual memory and history over time, which, if managed effectively, can benefit and sustain family and community history at large.",

In this paper, we present findings from interviews with 16 older adult participants in the United States about their social network composition and related technology use during a challenging life event, the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw a decrease of in-person meetings and increase in communication technology adoption. Using the convoy model of social relations, we sought to better understand the roles different technologies play in older adults’ social connections. Participants chose what communication tools to use depending on social and situational contexts and overcame accessibility issues to adopt new technologies that supported continued engagement with their support networks. However, when others positioned technologies as ways for the older adults to receive social support, they resisted. A more comprehensive view of older adults’ evolving social convoys can help designers and researchers better create technologies that help expand and maintain older adults’ social support networks. Further, to facilitate older adults’ social connectivity, the design of technology should encourage older adults’ support networks to see those older adults as support providers, not just potential support recipients.",

In order to explore user preferences and interaction dynamics within this context, we investigated remote intergenerational communication through an analysis of 15 groups of parents and children from 16 families. Given the importance of collaborative activities in family and intergenerational connections, we aim to understand how these interactions and practices can adapt to remote environments. Our findings highlight both similarities and notable differences in the use of communication methods, workspace, and objects between parents and children. Particularly, we observed distinct patterns in gestural and verbal communication and identified specific challenges encountered by children in remote settings. Our findings also revealed the dynamics of play sessions, especially when co-located participants are involved, shedding light on the complexities of remote intergenerational communication. Our work offers valuable empirical insights on designing more effective and engaging remote collaborative platforms for families.",

      "abstract": "We explore the challenges individuals face when seeking like-minded partners to pursue shared interests in small groups, specifically outside the workplace, classroom, or other externally organized contexts. Conducting nine 90-minute semi-structured interviews involving a hypothetical small group formation process, we found four compounding challenges that make it difficult to form and maintain stable groups. In contrast to other kinds of small groups discussed in the literature, the unique combination of these challenges bring into focus a class of interest-based small groups we term \"shared interest pods\": self-assembled small groups united by shared interests, whose members derive benefits from sustained, synchronous interactions that hinge on the level of fit among them. The need to discover and maintain collective fit, the considerable commitment required for regular interactions, their small size, and the lack of external enforcement, makes shared interest pods fragile and unstable, and an information-rich site for studying dynamics of self-organized consensus-seeking in underexplored areas of Lee and Paine's Model of Coordinated Action, and for considering the tension between supporting personal agency through organic group formation and optimizing stability through algorithmic assignments. A central finding is how dynamics of maintaining and giving up control co-exist in shared interest pods in their search for collective fit. People seek to maintain control over certain aspects of finding fit (e.g. in determining group membership), but are simultaneously willing to give up control to organizers or algorithms under certain conditions (e.g. when balancing desired quality with social and ethical considerations). We discuss design implications for supporting the formation of shared interest pods, and more broadly, for exploring self-organized consensus-seeking in other societal collective decision-making contexts.",

AI systems have the potential to enhance access to timely medical advice based on this data that RPM devices produce. In this paper, we report on three studies investigating how users’ medical condition severity (normal vs. high blood pressure), security risk (low vs. modest vs. high risk), and medical advice source (human doctor vs. AI) influence user perceptions of advisor trustworthiness and willingness to disclose RPM-acquired information. We found that trust mediated the relationship between the advice source and users’ willingness to disclose health information: users trust doctors more than AI and are more willing to disclose their RPM-acquired health information to a more trusted advice source. However, we unexpectedly discovered that conditional on trust, users disclose RPM-acquired information more readily to AI than to doctors. We observed that the advice source did not influence perceptions of security and privacy risks. We conclude by discussing how our findings can support the design of RPM applications.",

While people with disabilities are often excluded or treated merely as the subjects of AI data collection, our work introduces a new model for disability data collection in which the disability community exerts agency and control over their personal data and data-driven experiences. Our ethnographic data show that community-led data collection not only produces data needed to represent the community in AI systems, but also empowers the community and its members, by embracing - rather than concealing - stuttering and stutterer identity, and strengthening the social bonds of the community. Recognizing the lack of adequate socio-technical infrastructure for community-led, grassroots data collection, we discuss practical challenges, as well as the strategies and factors for communities to succeed in similar endeavors.",

Furthermore, this understanding can bring insights to inform technology design for supporting co-parenting. In this paper, we present an overview of related research on parents' collaboration, support, and relationships. We then report findings from an exploratory semi-structured interview study with 11 pairs of new parents who are interested in co-parenting skills and unpack their helpful co-parenting strategies, tools, and challenges when applying those strategies. We conclude with a discussion of the design implications and connections of these implications to technology ideas aiming to support new parents' positive co-parenting in their day-to-day lives and an observation that couples' co-parenting is a case of coproduction.",

To transform these workplace dynamics, this paper proposes creating culturally-aware workplace tools, specifically designed to adapt to the cultural dimensions of monochronic and polychronic work styles. We illustrate this approach with \"CultureFit,\" a tool that we engineered based on extensive research in Chronemics and culture theories. To study and evaluate our tool in the real world, we conducted a field experiment with 55 workers from 24 different countries. Our field experiment revealed that CultureFit significantly improved the earnings of workers from cultural backgrounds often overlooked in design. Our study is among the pioneering efforts to examine culturally aware digital labor interventions. It also provides access to a dataset with over two million data points on culture and digital work, which can be leveraged for future research in this emerging field. The paper concludes by discussing the importance and future possibilities of incorporating cultural insights into the design of tools for digital labor.",

However, understanding the impact of peer interactions on user engagement and the innovation process remains challenging. While previous studies have focused on sentiment analysis, the contextual interpretation of peer feedback and its effects on engagement and innovation have yet to be explored. To address this knowledge gap, we propose a feature-based AI model that categorizes peer feedback based on its quality and polarity. Our model achieves 96% accuracy in identifying feedback quality (constructive vs. non-constructive and toxic vs. non-toxic) and feedback polarity (negative vs. positive). This contextual feedback categorization provides a foundation for quantitatively analyzing the impacts of feedback on user engagement and the innovation process. Our results show that positive and constructive peer feedback has a significantly positive effect, while toxic and negative peer feedback has a significantly negative impact on the process of idea generation, idea evaluation, and idea selection. Our results also indicate that inexperienced users are more susceptible to toxic feedback than experienced users. Based on these findings, we suggest a recommendation and reward system for incentivizing constructive feedback and preventing toxic feedback.",

These tensions are particularly salient in the context of open-source software libraries for DP data analysis, which are emerging tools to help data stewards and analysts build privacy-preserving data pipelines for their applications. While there has been significant investment into such libraries, there has been little inquiry into the role of these libraries in promoting understanding of and trust in DP, and in turn, the ways in which design and engagement of these open-source libraries can shed light on the challenges of creating trustworthy data infrastructures in practice.  \n\nIn this study, we rely on qualitative methods and mental models approaches to analyze the differences between conceptual models used to design open-source DP libraries and mental models of DP held by users. Through a two-stage study design involving formative interviews with 5 developers of open-source DP libraries and user studies with 17 data analysts, we find  that DP libraries often struggle to bridge the gaps between developer and user mental models. In particular, we highlight the tension DP libraries face in maintaining rigorous DP implementations and facilitating user interaction.

      "abstract": "Domestic violence (DV) survivors from marginalized communities face serious challenges when seeking governmental services and community resources. Current resources often overlook victim-survivors' needs, neglecting their choices and autonomy. Through studying the context of DV within the US-based Muslim community and embracing a Survivor-Centered Transformative Justice approach, we introduce \\textit{healing structures}, structures promoting justice for victim-survivors\nand their communities, where healing is promoted by tackling harmful practices and discriminatory laws and fostering collective and survivor-centered interventions. \nThrough focus groups, design concepts, and expert evaluations, we unveil three sociotechnical processes that establish healing structures for survivors and their communities when implemented collectively and simultaneously. The processes are: 1) Survivor advocacy, ensuring safety, empowerment, informed decision-making, and care continuity. 2) Community accountability, encouraging reparation and behavioral change of abusers through communal intervention and support. 3) Institutional transformation, reshaping broader conditions perpetuating abuse through preventive measures and structural reform. We conclude by reflecting on healing structures and discussing their design implications and potential tensions.",

      "abstract": "Fake news on social media has large, negative implications for society. However, little is known about what linguistic cues make people fall for fake news and, hence, how to design effective countermeasures for social media. In this study, we seek to understand which linguistic cues make people fall for fake news. Linguistic cues (e.g., adverbs, personal pronouns, positive emotion words, negative emotion words) are important characteristics of any text and also affect how people process real vs. fake news. Specifically, we compare the role of linguistic cues across both cognitive processing (related to careful thinking) and affective processing (related to unconscious automatic evaluations). To this end, we performed a within-subject experiment where we collected neurophysiological measurements of 42 subjects while these read a sample of 40 real and fake news articles. During our experiment, we measured cognitive processing through eye fixations, and affective processing in situ through heart rate variability. We find that users engage more in cognitive processing for longer fake news articles, while affective processing is more pronounced for fake news written in analytic words. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying the role of linguistic cues in fake news processing. Altogether, our findings have important implications for designing online platforms that encourage users to engage in careful thinking and thus prevent them from falling for fake news.",

      "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence for Social Good (AI4SG) has emerged as a growing body of scholarship and applied programs exploring AI technologies' potential to tackle social issues, emphasizing interdisciplinary partnerships with community organizations, such as non-profits and international organizations. What are the needs, expectations, and aspirations of community organizations, and are they being met? Pursuing these questions is important to ensure that the considerable efforts by the AI teams and the community organizations actually achieve the impacts they strive for. Anchoring on the Data Feminism framework, we addressed these questions with 16 semi-structured interviews with members of social sector organizations on AI4SG projects. Our study reveals a pervasive influence of funders' agendas and AI hype on collaborations. Despite the significant intellectual contributions from community organization members, their goals were frequently sidelined in favor of other stakeholders' priorities. While many expected a tangible product or deployment from the partnerships, only two out of 14 projects we studied reached the deployment stage. However, community organization members sustained their recognition of the technology teams' expertise and belief in the potential of the projects, still seeing diminished goals as valuable. To enhance the efficacy of future collaborations, our participants shared their aspirations for success, demanding co-leadership from the early stages of and throughout the projects. We propose to use data co-liberation as a grounding principle for AI4SG moving forward, arguing that community organizations’ co-leadership is essential for fostering more effective, sustainable, and ethical development of technology in socially driven collaborations.",

However, other work demonstrates how these interventions may instead serve to limit critique to that addressed within the intervention, while rendering broader concerns illegitimate. In this paper, drawing on work examining how standards enact discursive closure and how power relations affect whether and how people raise critique, we recruit three corporate teams, and one activist team, each with prior context working with one another, to play a game designed to trigger broad discussion around AI ethics. We use this as a point of contrast to trigger reflection on their teams’ past discussions, examining factors which may affect their “license to critique” in AI ethics discussions. We then report on how particular affordances of this game may influence discussion, and find that the hypothetical context created in the game is unlikely to be a viable mechanism for real world change. We discuss how power dynamics within a group and notions of “scope” affect whether people may be willing to raise critique in AI ethics discussions, and discuss our finding that games are unlikely to enable direct changes to products or practice, but may be more likely to allow members to find critically-aligned allies for future collective action.",

Through 14 semi-structured interviews conducted between February and April 2023, this study investigates how Afghan refugees utilize technology, tools, and skills in their resettlement process, and builds upon Hsiao et al.'s conceptualization of sociotechnical adaptation. The findings reveal (i) gender and collectivist cultural values play a big role in determining the types of adaptation strategies used by men versus women, (ii) strategic choices in terms of the type of support sought depending on shared versus non-shared identity of host community members, (iii) a notable tension between economic adaptation and preserving socio-cultural values is observed, and (iv) creative, collective solutions by women participants to address economic challenges, contributing to the discourse on solidarity economies in HCI. Key contributions include  (a) design implications for technological products that can aid in psychological adaptation, fostering solidarity economies, and creating digital safe spaces for refugees to connect with shared-identity host populations, and (b) policy and program recommendations for refugee resettlement agencies to enhance digital literacy among refugees.",

      "abstract": "Families managing serious health conditions in children are often burdened not just by the challenge of health management but also by the heavy weight of stigma. To assist these families, a variety of physical and digital support systems have been established to address their emotional and informational needs. In our study, we interviewed 32 children and parents living with serious chronic pulmonary illnesses to gain insights into their experiences with both their conditions and support systems in place. We discovered that although a wide range of support systems was available, most participants chose to selectively engage or completely withdraw from them. Through the lens of Ecological Systems Theory, we shed light on the presence of health-related stigma and unintended stigma associated with support systems across different ecological layers. Our work provides a comprehensive and dynamic perspective on stigma, considering technological, interpersonal, institutional, and social factors. By examining how stigma arises in social interactions, we delve into the concept of \"stigma work\" and offer design considerations for more empathetic support systems that attend to individuals and groups with stigmatized health conditions, identities, or experiences.",

However, the future path of Mastodon remains uncertain, particularly in terms of its challenges and the long-term viability of a more citizen-powered internet. In this paper, following a pre-study survey, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 Mastodon instance administrators, including those who host instances to support marginalised and stigmatised communities, to understand their motivations and lived experiences of running decentralised social media. Our research indicates that while decentralised social media offers significant potential in supporting the safety, identity and privacy needs of marginalised and stigmatised communities, they also face considerable challenges in content moderation, community building and governance.

      "abstract": "COVID Long Haul (CLH) is an emerging chronic illness for which the healthcare system continues to seek a common understanding of symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. CLH experiences can differ drastically, necessitating personalized care plans. Because patients\ninteract with different clinicians during their CLH journey, it becomes important to ensure interoperability and understand clinical relevance of different data that can support clinicians in making appropriate recommendations. We conducted qualitative research\nwhere we interviewed 13 patients, conducted a focus group with 8 clinicians, and analyzed care plan follow-up records. We report patient and clinician expectations from and interactions with clinic data. We uncover logistical challenges, personal contexts, and\nhealth barriers impacting patient compliance. As researchers embedded in the clinical system, we identify the potential of using multiple patient data streams to support personalized treatment and clinical decisions. We discuss technology design opportunities and provide actionable recommendations for improving clinical workflows and cross-provider collaboration.",

      "abstract": "The role of a moderator is often characterized as solely punitive, however, moderators have the power to not only execute reactive and punitive actions but also create norms and support the values they want to see within their communities. One way moderators can proactively foster healthy communities is through positive reinforcement, but we do not currently know whether moderators on Reddit enforce their norms by providing positive feedback to desired contributions. To fill this gap in our knowledge, we surveyed 115 Reddit moderators to build two taxonomies: one for the content and behavior that actual moderators want to encourage and another taxonomy of actions moderators take to encourage desirable contributions. We found that prosocial behavior, engaging with other users, and staying within the topic and norms of the subreddit are the most frequent behaviors that moderators want to encourage. We also found that moderators are taking actions to encourage desirable contributions, specifically through built-in Reddit mechanisms (e.g., upvoting), replying to the contribution, and explicitly approving the contribution in the moderation queue. Furthermore, moderators reported taking these actions specifically to reinforce desirable behavior to the original poster and other community members, even though many of the actions are anonymous, so the recipients are unaware that they are receiving feedback from moderators. Importantly, some moderators who do not currently provide feedback do not object to the practice. Instead, they are discouraged by the lack of explicit tools for positive reinforcement and the fact that their fellow moderators are not currently engaging in methods for encouragement. We consider the taxonomy of actions moderators take, the reasons moderators are deterred from providing encouragement, and suggestions from the moderators themselves to discuss implications for designing tools to provide positive feedback.",

However, care home residents often require extensive support to participate effectively in video calls. Despite growing interest in examining the work involved in facilitating technology use in care homes, the role of caregivers---comprising family members and staff---in facilitating video calls has received limited attention. Drawing on data from a study of family members' experiences in Australia, we analysed the essential work activities required to make video calls function in residential aged care. We show how video calling is underpinned by the development of relationships between families and staff, and how video calling requires considerable work in preparation, facilitation, and troubleshooting. We discuss how video calling systems for care homes might be designed to alleviate unwanted work, lowering the burden of call participation for residents, families, and care staff.",

      "abstract": "Researchers in the CSCW community have long problematized the separation of social and ethical considerations from design work. Despite increasing attention to tech ethics and ethics education, however, computer scientists' sense of ethical responsibility remains of concern. This paper offers insights on how this boundary between tech and ethics is maintained and reinforced for students today as they develop their identities as computer scientists. Drawing on interviews with eight undergraduate computer science (CS) students at [Anonymized] University, we explore the role that ethics play in the legitimate peripheral participation of students inside and outside their formal education. We found that while individual opinions on the importance of ethics varied, students agreed that ethics are not valued or rewarded in their education, extracurriculars, or future work prospects. We describe how placing ethics outside the boundary of computing acts as a form of occupational closure, excluding both important multidisciplinary work and marginalized bodies. We argue that in order to promote ethical practice in the design of CSCW systems, we must make it in the interest of future designers to learn socially grounded ethics. This requires that designers, researchers, and future employers actively reshape the boundaries of computing by asserting social and ethical considerations as values of computing and design.",

First, is decentralization a viable and desirable model? Second, how will AI impact online conversations? Third, how should we combat threats to researchers studying risky or contentious topics? Last, are we publishing too much while having too little impact? Panelists will present their own stances and then discuss and debate where the field should go.",

Key public sectors and industries are being increasingly datafied, often in the service of implementing AI tools to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and equity of public goods and services. This panel specifically examines the role of CSCW scholars in advancing public-interest technologies by engaging with datafication through the register of \\textit{data governance}. Each panelist brings perspectives from diverse domains of datafication - including healthcare, education, and agriculture - and state, corporate, and community forms of data governance. We invite panelists and attendees to explore a series of provocations focused on reconceptualizing our role and responsibility as researchers in intervening in processes of datafication and data governance.",

Emotion AI, a class of affective computing technologies used in personal and social computing, comprises emergent and controversial techniques aiming to classify human emotion and other affective phenomena. Industry, policy, and scientific actors debate potential benefits and harms, arguing for polarized futures ranging from panoptic expansion to complete bans. Emotion AI is proposed, deployed, and sometimes withdrawn in collaborative contexts such as education, hiring, healthcare, and service work. Proponents expound these technologies� benefits for well-being and security, while critics decry privacy harms, civil liberties risks, bias, and shaky scientific foundations, and gaps between technologies� capabilities and how they are marketed and legitimized. This panel brings diverse disciplinary perspectives into discussion about the history of emotions�as an example of �intimate� data�in computing, how emotion AI is legitimized, people�s experiences with and perceptions of emotion AI in social and collaborative settings, emotion AI�s development practices, and using design research to re-imagine emotion AI. These issues are relevant to the CSCW community in designing, evaluating, and regulating algorithmic sensing technologies including and beyond emotion-sensing.",

We adapt and conduct a participatory design workshop to focus on ambient interfaces for home health with 13 diverse older adults (e.g., six LGBTQ+, four Black, and all low-income). Using the prototypes they made as discussion catalyzers, participants shared different perspectives entailing stigmatized topics that can be difficult to discuss, such as drug use, sex, isolation, and dementia. They deliberated on the negative implications of VFAIs, such as a justified concern for surveillance, in conjunction with their positive implications, such as receiving always-available ``non-judgmental'' support. Similarly, the risk of leaking drug use data was considered alongside the benefits of sharing important medical information with clinicians. We synthesize our findings into design considerations, such as how we might address varying levels of trust in different stakeholders and reduce stigma that may hinder users from fully benefiting from VFAIs' capabilities.",

We conducted an observational study with the aim of identifying aspects of collaborative learning, including characteristics of collaborative partners, that impact older adults’ exploratory learning behaviour in feature-rich software. We recruited 22 participants (6 younger adults and 16 older adults) who formed 5 same-age and 6 mixed-age dyads. These dyads worked together remotely to explore a feature-rich application, which was new to them. We classified dyadic interactions into four different collaboration dynamics characterized by distinct attributes. We discovered that effective communication and the ability to navigate the software independently enabled a successful collaboration dynamic that empowered learners. We showed that trust between partners enabled effective communication and we observed that the existing relationship between partners strongly impacted their communication patterns. The more complicated study tasks required participants to validate the correctness of their work and this validation was particularly difficult for some novice older adults who did not benefit from transfer learning and struggled with navigation issues.",

In this paper, through a long-term (34 month), ethnographic approach, we study the ways that older adults arranged sociotechnical resources to sustain the community use of a makerspace. Our analysis identifies three interconnected resources that were developed: an adaptive staffing approach that could withstand constant personnel shifts and shortages; structured activities to draw interest and overcome challenges associated with learning to use the machines; and reference materials to support individuals in independent usage of the space. We describe the issues that arose as time went on with each of these resource types, and how individuals affiliated with the makerspace adapted the resources to address these issues. In the discussion, we extend best practices by reflecting on strategies that worked well in the makerspace, such as drawing interest through introductory classes, as well as different purposes for reference materials to support technology use.",

However, creating viable, practical monitoring systems for informing caregivers requires understanding which behaviors and signs to track and what approaches best present that information. To investigate how technology can be leveraged to better augment caregivers' workflows, we take a multi-stage, qualitative approach to gain insights into the needs of caregivers and the older adults receiving care.\nSpecifically, we use a series of domain expert interviews, cognitive walkthroughs, and semi-structured interviews with residents, and we synthesize our takeaways using thematic analysis at each phase. Our results show that this type of monitoring technology has great potential to reduce the effort needed by caregivers to complete their responsibilities and communicate with their teams. Additionally, we found that older adults are receptive to the technology but their privacy and autonomy must be prioritized for the sake of their mental wellbeing.",

However, HCWs are vulnerable and especially susceptible to wage theft, or not being paid their legally-entitled wages in full by their employers. Prior work has examined other low-wage work settings to show how technology is designed and deployed has the potential to both cause and address wage theft. We extend this work by examining the relationship between technology and wage theft in the home care context. We collaborated closely with a local grassroots organization to conduct interviews with workers and labor, legal, and payroll experts. We uncovered how the complex, volatile, and diverse nature of home care complicates the errors in time-tracking systems. Through design provocations and focus groups with workers and experts, we also investigated the potential of technology as a part of broader efforts to curb wage theft through educating and empowering isolated HCWs. While we found that approachable design could reduce errors in existing systems, make employer processes more transparent, and help workers exchange knowledge to build collective power, we also discuss concerns around burden, privacy, and accountability when designing technologies for HCWs and other low-wage workers.",

      "abstract": "Security and privacy (S\\&P) perspectives of people in a multi-user home are a growing area of research, with many researchers reflecting on the complicated power imbalance and challenging access control issues of the devices involved. However, these studies primarily focused on the multi-user scenarios in traditional family home settings leaving other types of multi-user home environments, such as homes shared by co-habitants without a familial relationship, under-studied. This paper closes this research gap via quantitative and qualitative analysis of results from an online survey and qualitative content analysis of sampled online posts on Reddit. The study explores the complex roles of shared home users, which depend on various factors unique to the shared home environment, e.g., who own what home devices, how home devices are used by multiple users, and more complicated relationships between the landlord and people in the shared home and among co-habitants. Half (50.7\\%) of our survey participants thought that devices in a shared home are less secure than in a traditional family home. This perception was found statistically significantly associated with factors such as the fear of devices being tampered with in their absence and (lack of) trust in other co-habitants and their visitors. We observed cyber-physical threats being a prominent topic discussed in Reddit posts. Our study revealed new user types and user relationships in a multi-user environment such as \\textit{ExternalPrimary-InternalPrimary} while analysing the landlord and shared home resident relationship with regard to shared home device use.  Based on the results of the online survey and the Reddit data, we propose a threat actor model for shared home environments, which has a focus on possible malicious behaviours of current and past co-habitants of a shared home, as a special type of \\textit{insider threats} in a home environment. We also recommend further research work into understanding the complex roles co-habitants can play in navigating and adapting to the security and privacy landscape of a shared home environment.",

We collect tweets on two propaganda events and one non-propaganda event with varying degrees of organized messaging. We then perform a comparative analysis of the user and network characteristics of social media networks around these events and find clearly distinguishable traits across events. We find that influential entities like prominent politicians, digital influencers, and mainstream media prefer to engage more with social media events with lesser degree of propaganda while avoiding events with high degree of propaganda, which are mostly sustained by lesser known but dedicated micro-influencers. We also find that network communities of events with high degree of propaganda are significantly centralized with respect to the influence exercised by their leaders. The methods and findings of this study can pave the way for modeling and early detection of other propaganda events, using their user and community characteristics.",

      "abstract": "The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine was accompanied by a large-scale, pro-Russian propaganda campaign on social media. However, the strategy behind the dissemination of propaganda has remained unclear, particularly how the online discourse was strategically shaped by the propagandists' community. Here, we analyze the strategy of the Twitter/X community using an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) approach. Specifically, IRL allows us to model online behavior as a Markov decision process, where the goal is to infer the underlying reward structure that guides propagandists when interacting with users with a supporting or opposing stance toward the invasion. Thereby, we aim to understand empirically whether and how between-user interactions are strategically used to promote the proliferation of Russian propaganda. For this, we leverage a large-scale dataset with 349,455 posts with pro-Russian propaganda from 132,131 users. We show that bots and humans follow a different strategy: bots respond predominantly to pro-invasion messages, suggesting that they seek to drive virality; in contrast, messages indicating opposition primarily elicit responses from humans, suggesting that they tend to engage in critical discussions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the strategy behind propaganda from the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine through the lens of IRL.",

Seeking for alternative ways of support, we evaluated the potential introduction of an online platform that combines multiple\nstreams of data, visualises school attendance boundaries, and enables the manipulation of representations of\nland parcels. To capture multiple stakeholders’ values about the potential to enhance public engagement in\nschool rezoning decision-making through an online platform, we conducted interviews with 12 participants\nwith previous experiences in traditional, in-person deliberations. Insights from the interviews highlight the\nseveral roles an online platform could take, especially as it provides alternative means of participation (online,\nsynchronous, and asynchronous). Additionally, we discuss the potential for technology to increase the visibility\nand participation of multiple community actors in public deliberations and present implications for design of\nfuture tools to support public decision-making.",

In this paper, we interviewed 12 informal caregivers of Persons Living With Dementia (PLWD) to understand their needs and current coping strategies for overcoming caregiving burden, specifically around emotion work. The caregivers associated different personal meanings with caregiving. Participants wanted technology to take over some of the utilitarian, mundane caregiving tasks. At the same time, they did not want technology to take over the tasks that fostered personal connections with PLWD. As the disease progressed, caregivers started to lose their perceived bond with PLWD, making it more challenging to juggle between the rewarding, positive emotions with negative experiences. We discuss such complexity of emotion work using the notion of Invisible Work to understand when technology should or should not support the emotion work engaged in informal caregiving.",

Verbal agitation can impose mental distress on informal caregivers (e.g., family, friends), which may cause severe mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety disorders. To improve informal caregivers' mental health, we explore design opportunities by interviewing 11 informal caregivers suffering from verbal agitation of PwD. In particular, we first characterize how the predictability of verbal agitation impacts informal caregivers' mental health and how caregivers' coping strategies vary before, during, and after verbal agitation. Based on our findings, we propose design opportunities to improve the mental health of informal caregivers suffering from verbal agitation: distracting PwD (in-situ support; before), prompting just-in-time maneuvers (information support; during), and comfort and education (social & information support; after). We discuss our reflections on cultural disparities between participants. Our work envisions a broader design space for supporting informal caregivers' well-being and describes when and how that support could be provided.",

      "abstract": "Frontline workers (FLWs) provide essential services necessary for a functioning society, but the nature of their work contributes to their high rates of burnout. This burnout impacts not only their own health, but also has dire consequences for the people most in need of their services. Digital interventions for burnout may provide scalable, accessible, and cost-effective care. However, most have been designed to intervene at the individual-level and have been inadequate in sustainably alleviating burnout. In addition, these interventions have not considered how we might integrate more effective organizational-level strategies or reflect FLWs’ own experiences and the unique contexts of frontline work in their design. One important, yet understudied, domain of frontline work that experiences high rates of burnout is gender-based violence (GBV) service provision in nonprofit organizations. Using a community-based participatory research approach, we ran 8 co-design workshops to understand FLWs’ experiences, hopes, and perceptions of technology for burnout support within their organizations with FLWs and supervisors from various nonprofit GBV organizations in a large metropolitan city in the United States. We found that participants greatly valued their support systems and supervisory relationships at work. And while there was a desire to use technology as support tools for burnout, participants were wary of how it could conflict with these support systems and important organizational values. We contribute a multilevel framework for digital burnout interventions and argue for a methodological shift to an assets-based approach to reframe the future of research and design of burnout interventions that are centered on the needs, values, and lived experiences of FLWs.",

      "abstract": "This research examines how caseworkers collaborate with foster families to address adolescent online safety. We interviewed 32 caseworkers who worked with teens (ages 13-17) in foster care within the past 5 years. Using thematic analysis, we found that case managers are most concerned about sexual-related risks that result in physical abuse (e.g., sex trafficking) or online interactions that facilitated offline risks (e.g., runaway, illegal drug activity), rather than risks that only manifested in virtual spaces. Yet, inadequate training and insufficient support left caseworkers at a loss for how to address these challenges on top of their already heavy caseloads, often making online safety an afterthought. We call on the foster care system to place a higher priority in providing collaborative and socio-technical ecological support for caseworkers, foster parents, and children, so that early risk prevention in online spaces can support the safety and well-being of foster youth offline.",

      "abstract": "On-demand mental health services—including counseling, crisis hotlines, and peer support programs—are vital to the healthcare system, providing acute and ongoing support through telephone, online, and text-based communication. Although such services have proven effective at reducing hopelessness, psychological pain, and suicidality, they put mental health professionals at high risk of burnout, secondary traumatic stress, and compassion fatigue. Our interviews with mental health workers across professions from four mental health organizations revealed that while mental health workers have a strong motivation to help individuals struggling to meet their mental health needs, they face various challenges, including heavy caseloads, having to navigate dealing with crisis clients and managing the impact of abuse and harassment. Although organizations spend a significant time training workers prior to their involvement with clients, the training lacks components of self-compassion and self-care. To overcome their challenges, participants identify the need to be self-reliant and engage in care practices ranging from socializing with coworkers to yoga and meditation. Although technology is an integral part of their work routine, participants, irrespective of their age, had misapprehensions regarding technology use in the mental health care space and for managing one’s own psychological well-being. We recommend design guidelines for HCI researchers, including developing contextualized just-in-time adaptive interventions to promote self-compassion and educating workers regarding the use of various technologies to manage their psychological well-being.",

An integral aspect of therapy involves setting goals that clients engage in outside therapy, known as therapy homework or between-session goals . Yet clients overwhelmingly do not complete between-session goals. This study explores mental health therapists' and clients' challenges in collaborating to set and manage engagement with between-session goals, and how technology could better support them. We interviewed 13 therapists and 14 clients about their experiences with therapy goals. We identify therapist information needs for supporting the client, challenges in collaboration, and how technology can support client-therapist collaboration. Therapists need in-the-moment information about client engagement with goals to inform decision-making. Clients can feel reluctant to share information due to a lack of trust, embarrassment, or not knowing what to share. Clients could use technology to asynchronously communicate about sensitive topics to therapists. Technologies could facilitate gathering in-the-moment data that supports client-therapist collaboration for goals.",

However, little is known about what makes hate speech on social media go viral. In this paper, we collect N = 25,219 cascades with 65,946 retweets from X (formerly known as Twitter) and classify them as hateful vs. normal. Using a generalized linear regression, we then estimate differences in the spread of hateful vs. normal content based on author and content variables. We thereby identify important determinants that explain differences in the spreading of hateful vs. normal content. For example, hateful content authored by verified users is disproportionally more likely to go viral than hateful content from non-verified ones: hateful content from a verified user (as opposed to normal content) has a 3.5 times larger cascade size, a 3.2 times longer cascade lifetime, and a 1.2 times larger structural virality. Altogether, we offer novel insights into the virality of hate speech on social media.",

However, it can be difficult to effectively implement on platforms that leverage spoken language due to the distinct biomarkers present in the human voice. In this work, we explore the use of voice anonymization methods within the context of a technology-enhanced civic dialogue network based in the United States, whose purpose is to increase feelings of agency and being heard within civic processes. Specifically, we investigate the use of two different speech transformation and synthesis methods for anonymization: voice conversion (VC) and text-to-speech (TTS). Through a series of two studies, we examine the impact that each method has on 1) the empathy and trust that listeners feel towards a person sharing a personal story, and 2) a speaker's own perception of being heard, finding that voice conversion is an especially suitable method for our purposes. Our findings open up interesting potential research directions related to anonymous spoken discourse, as well as additional ways of engaging with voice-based civic technologies.",

      "abstract": "Email continues to serve as a central medium for managing collaborations. While unstructured email messaging is lightweight and conducive to coordination, it is easy to overlook commitments and requests on collaborations that are embedded in the text of free-flowing communications. Twenty years ago, Bellotti et al. proposed TaskMaster with the goal of redesigning the email interface to have explicit task management capabilities. Recently, AI-based task-recognition and reminder services have been introduced in major email systems as one approach to managing asynchronous collaborations. While these services have been provided to millions of people around the world, there is little understanding of how people interact with and benefit from them. To better understand how AI-powered reminders can support asynchronous collaborations, we explore knowledge workers' experiences with Microsoft's Viva Daily Briefing Email. Through semi-structured interviews and surveys, we shed light on how AI-powered reminders are incorporated into workflows to support asynchronous collaborations. We identify what knowledge workers prefer AI-powered reminders to remind them about and how they would like to interact with these reminders. Using mixed methods and a self-assessment methodology, we investigate the relationship between information workers’ work styles and the perceived value of the Viva Daily Briefing Email to identify users who are more likely to benefit from AI-powered reminders for asynchronous collaborations. We conclude by discussing the experiences and futures of AI-powered reminders for collaborative tasks and asynchronous collaborations.",

Most existing studies focused on video creators, leaving the motivations and practices of viewers underexplored. We interviewed 18 participants, surveyed 121 respondents, and derived a model characterizing consumers' video consumption practices on social media. The practices include five main activities: deciding to watch videos driven by various motivations, accessing videos on social media through a socio-technical ecosystem, watching videos to meet informational, emotional, and entertainment needs, evaluating the credibility and interestingness of videos, and using videos to achieve health goals. The five activities do not necessarily proceed in a linear fashion; rather, their arrangement is situational, depending on individuals' motivations and their social and technological environments. We further identified challenges that consumers face while consuming health videos on social media and discussed design implications and directions for future research.",

      "abstract": "The widespread adoption of social media platforms has provided social scientists with access to vast amounts of data on human interactions, enabling the study of online behavior at an unprecedented scale. These platforms typically structure conversations as threads, forming tree-like structures known as ``discussion trees.'' This paper investigates the structural properties of online discussions on Reddit by analyzing both global (community-level) and local (post-level) attributes of these discussion trees. We conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of a year's worth of Reddit data, encompassing a quarter of a million posts and several million comments. Our primary objective is to disentangle the relative impacts of global and local properties and evaluate how specific features shape discussion tree structures. The results reveal that both local and global features contribute significantly to explaining structural variation in discussion trees. However, local features, such as post content and sentiment, collectively have a greater impact, accounting for a larger proportion of variation in the width, depth, and size of discussion trees. Our analysis also uncovers considerable heterogeneity in the impact of various features on discussion structures. Notably, certain global features including the subreddit's topic, age, popularity, and content redundancy play crucial roles in determining specific discussion tree properties. For instance, posts in subreddits focused on politics, sports, and current events tend to generate deeper and wider discussion trees. This research enhances our understanding of online conversation dynamics and offers valuable insights for both content creators and platform designers. By elucidating the factors that shape online discussions, our work contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve the quality and effectiveness of digital discourse.",

      "abstract": "Friendships are a key element of mental health, yet modern life increasingly involves \"enforced online regimes,\" which can inhibit friendship formation. One example is provided by residential university students under COVID-19. Through interviews with 17 graduate students at a U.S. university, we investigate how new friendships were made and maintained under the pandemic. While some of our individual findings echo previous work with online social interaction, our analysis reveals a novel 7-phase friendship formation process that extends Levinger \\& Snoek's classic pair-relatedness theory. The model enables pinpoint diagnoses. For our participants, three specific phases were blocked -- Physical Awareness (apprehension of another's physical characteristics); Personal Contact (exchange of personal information); and Ongoing Mutuality (repeat interactions to build friendship). The model also explains divergent results under similar but different situations (e.g., residential students under COVID eventually made friends, but students of purely online courses do not), and enables targeted recommendations.",

      "abstract": "Mounting evidence indicates that the artificial intelligence (AI) systems that rank our social media feeds bear nontrivial responsibility for amplifying partisan animosity: negative thoughts, feelings, and behaviors toward political out-groups. Can we design these AIs to consider democratic values such as mitigating partisan animosity as part of their objective functions? We introduce a method for translating established, vetted social scientific constructs into AI objective functions, which we term societal objective functions, and demonstrate the method with application to the political science construct of anti-democratic attitudes. Traditionally, we have lacked observable outcomes to use to train such models—however, the social sciences have developed survey instruments and qualitative codebooks for these constructs, and their precision facilitates translation into detailed prompts for large language models. We apply this method to create a democratic attitude model that estimates the extent to which a social media post promotes anti-democratic attitudes, and test this democratic attitude model across three studies. In Study 1, we first test the attitudinal and behavioral effectiveness of the intervention among US partisans (N=1,380) by manually annotating (alpha=.895) social media posts with anti-democratic attitude scores and testing several feed ranking conditions based on these scores. Removal (d=.20) and downranking feeds (d=.25) reduced participants' partisan animosity without compromising their experience and engagement. In Study 2, we scale up the manual labels by creating the democratic attitude model, finding strong agreement with manual labels (rho=.75). Finally, in Study 3, we replicate Study 1 using the democratic attitude model instead of manual labels to test its attitudinal and behavioral impact (N=558), and again find that the feed downranking using the societal objective function reduced partisan animosity (d=.25). This method presents a novel strategy to draw on social science theory and methods to mitigate societal harms in social media AIs.",

      "abstract": "Money is a sensitive and complex component of everyday life, which can significantly affect people's relationships with each other. Recently, emerging digital peer-to-peer (P2P) payment applications continue to complicate how people deal with money with individuals they know in comparison to traditional payment methods such as physical money (i.e., cash). Through an online survey study (N=218), in this paper, we investigate significant differences between using digital P2P payments and traditional payment methods (i.e., physical money) in terms of perceptions of transactions by using a given payment method, perceptions of people's existing interpersonal relationships with their known contacts after such transactions, and future use intention of a given payment method. We thus offer empirical evidence to highlight multidimensional influences of using digital P2P payments on established offline interpersonal relationships compared to using traditional payment methods (i.e., physical money). We also provide crucial new insights to unpack digital P2P payments as a novel technology-mediated interpersonal dynamic in people's everyday lives, which goes beyond merely as a business payment model or a financial service. We additionally provide important directions for designing more supportive and socially satisfactory digital P2P payment platforms in the future by taking the interplay of financial exchanges and interpersonal relationships into consideration.",

      "abstract": "People often leverage multiple platforms to share activities they undertake in their lives, from music listening to eating. Broad-purpose platforms, which people use to share a wide variety activities with a diverse audience, and dedicated platforms, which often focus on tracking and sharing a specific activity with connections with similar interests, both help individuals seeking social benefits from sharing their activity. Researchers designing systems for activity sharing have often reflected on whether to support sharing on dedicated or broad platforms, suggesting a need to better understand their relative utility. We collected and compared the response received between 700,000 pairs of activity-sharing posts on four sets of broad-purpose and dedicated platforms across two domains: physical activity (Strava, MapMyRun) and creativity (Dribbble, Behance). Results showed that dedicated platforms were more likely to receive responses (likes and comments), and comments were more likely be encouraging and refer to specific qualities of the activities being shared. We reflect on the tradeoff between sheer audience volume and likelihood of response, and discuss how to design prompts and templates into sharing features which better align with the norms of respective platforms.",

As people increasingly rely on digital communication to initiate and resolve conflicts, we examine how design can improve the experience of working through hard conversations within close relationships. We interviewed six psychotherapists and twenty-one social media users to understand both theoretical best practices for navigating conflict and users’ experiences with hard conversations online, particularly on text-based messaging platforms. We used our findings to create a temporal model of how digital design could intervene to support users and their relationships during these conversations. Specifically, we find that design can help to facilitate more mutually consensual difficult conversations, support emotional regulation during the conversation, and help facilitate pauses when necessary. We explore the tensions between balancing the needs of relationships and the individuals in them in digital design, and how to center relationships in digital design.",

      "abstract": "Social media systems are a pervasive part of modern society.  They have been almost universally adopted for a broad range of purposes including work, entertainment, activism, and decision making.   They have also diversified, with many distinct designs varying in content type, organization, delivery mechanism, access control, and many other dimensions. In this work, we describe a design space of social media systems that aims to help understand similarities and differences, recognize potential consequences of design choice, and identify spaces for innovation. The Form-From model characterizes social media based on (1) the form of the content, either threaded or flat, and (2) from where or whom one might receive content, ranging from spaces to networks to commons. We derive Form-From inductively from a larger set of 62 dimensions organized into 10 categories. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we trace social media as they traverse the Form-From space over time and identify common design patterns within cells of the model.",

Such platforms include dating apps (e.g., Tinder) and in-person gig work websites (e.g., TaskRabbit, Care.com). Protecting the users of these online-offline systems requires answering calls from prior work to consider `post-digital' orientations of safety: shifting from traditional technological security thinking to consider algorithm-driven consequences that emerge throughout online and offline contexts rather than solely acknowledging online threats. To support post-digital safety in platforms that make algorithmically-mediated offline introductions (AMOIs), we apply a mixed-methods approach to identify the core harms that AMOI users experience, the protective safety behaviors they employ, and the prevalence of those behaviors. First, we systematically review existing work (n=93), synthesizing the harms that threaten AMOIs and the protective behaviors people employ to combat these harms. Second, we validate prior work and fill gaps left by primarily qualitative inquiry through a survey of respondents' definitions of safety in AMOI and the prevalence and implementation of their protective behaviors. We focus on two exemplar populations who engage in AMOIs: online daters (n=476) and in-person gig workers (n=451). We draw on our systematization and prevalence data to identify several directions for designers and researchers to reimagine defensive tools to support safety in AMOIs.",

      "abstract": "The success of human-AI teams (HATs) requires humans to work with AI teammates in trustful ways over a certain time period. However, how trust evolves and changes dynamically in response to human-AI team interactions is generally understudied. This work explores the evolvement of trust in HATs over time by analyzing 45 participants' experiences of trust or distrust in an AI teammate prior to, during, and after collaborating with AI in a three-member HAT. Our findings highlight that humans' expectations of AI's ability, integrity, benevolence, and adaptability influence their initial trust in AI before collaboration. However, this initial trust can be maintained or revised through the development of situational trust during collaboration in response to the AI teammate's communication behaviors. Further, the trust developed through collaboration can impact individuals' subsequent expectations of AI's ability and their collaborations with AI. Our findings also reveal the similarities and differences in the temporal dimensions of trust for AI and human teammates. We contribute to CSCW community by offering one of the first empirical investigations into the dynamic and temporal dimension of trust evolvement in HATs. Our work yields insights into the pathways to expanding the methodological toolkit for investigating the development of trust in HATs, formulating theories of trust for the HAT context. These insights further inform the effective design of AI teammates and provide guidance on the timing, content, and methods for calibrating trust in future human-AI collaboration contexts.",

      "abstract": "Virtual academic networking is socio-technically challenging, however, fruitful for researchers' success. \nWe introduce a system called \\Sys{} to tackle the challenge and facilitate connections of researchers \\rev{in virtual social hours}. \\Sys{} allows academic researchers to create a research profile and express their research interests, find researchers with similar interests, overcome social barriers, and coordinate and start video chats, all within a single interface. \nWe engaged in an iterative design process by deploying \\Sys{} at academic conferences. In our preliminary deployment (N=80), we found that researchers often have difficulty finding other researchers who share similar interests, and they are shy about reaching out to other researchers. Inspired by this, we implemented social-signaling features to \\Sys{} and ran our first deployment (N=220). Our results highlight that the interface allowed users to find relevant researchers and helped them feel confident in joining conversations. However, this led to large group conversations where discussion topics were more superficial. In response, we developed and deployed our second interface (N=81). Key improvements were managing the size of conversations, dynamically determining if individuals can join a conversation based on their relevance to the ongoing discussion, and maintaining the ratio of senior and junior members, to further enhance the quality of discussions. As a result, participants were able to meet more people and engage in more meaningful conversations.\nOur work demonstrates an interface design for social networking in academic settings and how to lower social barriers in virtual networking.",

Even though AI's communication serves as an essential part of facilitating team coordination and shaping team outcomes, the impact of AI's communication modality on human-AI teamwork is still understudied. Using a mixed-design experiment and follow-up group interviews with 100 participants, we investigate the impact of AI's communication modality, one of AI's most essential communication characteristics, on team coordination and team outcomes in two different human-AI team compositions, human-human-AI teams, and human-AI-AI teams. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between AI's verbal communication and visual communication, which inspire two design recommendations on how to apply AI's verbal and visual communication to support human-AI coordination effectively. Our study generates an initial understanding of the role that AI's communication will have in ensuring team effectiveness in human-AI teams in the CSCW/HCI field.",

      "abstract": "Emotion AI is increasingly used to automatically evaluate asynchronous hiring interviews. Although touted for increasing hiring fit and reducing bias, it is unclear how job-seekers perceive emotion AI-enabled asynchronous interviews. This gap is striking, given job-seekers' marginalized position in hiring and how job-seekers with marginalized identities may be particularly vulnerable to this technology's potential harms. Addressing this gap, we conducted exploratory interviews with 14 U.S.-based participants with direct, recent experience with emotion AI-enabled asynchronous interviews. While participants acknowledged the asynchronous, virtual modality's potential benefits to employers and job-seekers, they perceived harms to job-seekers associated with automatic emotion inferences that our analysis maps to distributive, procedural, and interactional injustices. We find that social identity can inform job-seekers' perceptions of emotion AI, extending prior work's understandings of the factors contributing to job-seekers' perceptions of AI (broadly) in hiring. Moreover, our results suggest that emotion AI use may reconfigure demands for emotional labor in hiring and that deploying this technology in its current state may unjustly risk harmful outcomes for job-seekers -- or, at the very least, perceptions thereof, which shape behaviors and attitudes. Accordingly, we recommend against the present adoption of emotion AI in hiring, identifying opportunities for the design of future asynchronous hiring interview platforms to be meaningfully transparent, contestable, and privacy-preserving. We emphasize that only a subset of perceived harms we surface may be alleviated by these efforts; some injustices may only be resolved by removing emotion AI-enabled features.",

      "abstract": "Selecting an effective utterance among countless possibilities that match a user's intention poses a challenge when using natural language interfaces. To address the challenge, we leveraged the principle of least collaborative effort in communication grounding theory and designed three grounded conversational interactions: 1) a grounding interface allows users to start with a provisional input and then invite a conversational agent to complete their input, 2) a multiple grounding interface presents multiple inputs for the user to select from, and 3) a structured grounding interface guides users to write inputs in a structure best understood by the system. We compared our three grounding interfaces to an ungrounded control interface in a crowdsourced study (N=80) using a natural language system that generates small programs. We found that the grounding interfaces reduced cognitive load and improved task performance. The structured grounding interface further reduced speaker change costs and improved technology acceptance, without sacrificing the perception of control. We discuss the implications of designing grounded conversational interactions in natural language systems.",

Focusing on San Francisco's decade-long policy of algorithmic school assignments, we draw on procedural and distributive justice theory to investigate parents' fairness perceptions of the assignment algorithm. We find that how parents define fairness, e.g. same rules applied to everyone or receiving their top choice, significantly impacts their overall perception of the fairness of the outcome they received, controlling for the desirability of that outcome. Moreover, people's definitions and perceptions of fairness differ across socioeconomic and racial groups. For instance, among white respondents, the most used definition of fairness was ``proximity'' to their assigned school, whereas, among Hispanic or Latino parents, the most popular definition of fairness was that the ``same rules'' are applied to everyone. It is crucial for computational system designers and policymakers to consider these differences when deciding on the goals and values embedded in decision-making systems and who those goals and values reflect.",

      "abstract": "The widespread consumer-grade 3D printers and learning resources online enable novices to self-train in remote settings. While troubleshooting plays an essential part of 3D printing, the process remains challenging for many remote novices even with the help of well-developed online sources, such as online troubleshooting archives and online community help. We conducted a formative study with 76 active 3D printing users to learn how remote novices leverage online resources in troubleshooting and their challenges. We found that remote novices cannot fully utilize online resources. For example, the online archives provide general information in a static way, making it hard to search and relate their unique cases with existing descriptions. Online communities can potentially ease their struggles by providing more targeted suggestions, but a helper who can provide custom help is rather scarce, making it hard to obtain timely assistance. We propose 3DPFIX, an interactive 3D troubleshooting system powered by the pipeline to facilitate Human-AI Collaboration, designed to improve novices' 3D printing experiences and thus help them easily accumulate their domain knowledge. We built 3DPFIX that supports automated diagnosis and solution-seeking. 3DPFIX was built upon shared dialogues about failure cases from Q&A discourses accumulated in online communities. We leverage social annotations (i.e., comments) to build an annotated failure image dataset for AI classifiers and extract a solution pool. Our summative study revealed that using 3DPFIX helped participants spend significantly less effort in diagnosing failures and finding a more accurate solution than relying on their common practice. We also found that 3DPFIX users learn about 3D printing domain-specific knowledge. We discuss the implications of leveraging community-driven data in developing future Human-AI collaboration designs.",

In this, we do not explicitly frame our questions as questions of algorithmic fairness, but rather relate them to current human hiring practice. As our findings show, while many notions are well understood, fairness, potential to increase diversity and practical applicability are rated differently, illustrating the importance of understanding the application domain and its nuances, and calling for more interdisciplinary and human-centered research into the perception of mathematical fairness notions.",

      "abstract": "Many guidelines for responsible AI have been suggested to help AI practitioners in the development of ethical and responsible AI systems. However, these guidelines are often neither grounded in regulation nor usable by different roles, from developers to decision makers. To bridge this gap, we developed a four-step method to generate a list of responsible AI guidelines; these steps are: (1) manual coding of 17 papers on responsible AI; (2) compiling an initial catalog of responsible AI guidelines; (3) refining the catalog through interviews and expert panels; and (4) finalizing the catalog. To evaluate the resulting 22 guidelines, we incorporated them into an interactive tool and assessed them in a user study with 14 AI researchers, engineers, designers, and managers from a large technology company. Through interviews with these practitioners, we found that the guidelines were grounded in current regulations and usable across roles, encouraging self-reflection on ethical considerations at early stages of development. This significantly contributes to the concept of `Responsible AI by Design'— a design-first approach that embeds responsible AI values throughout the development lifecycle and across various business roles.",

      "abstract": "The field of fair AI aims to counter biased algorithms through computational modelling. However, it faces increasing criticism for perpetuating the use of overly technical and reductionist methods. As a result, novel approaches appear in the field to address more socially-oriented and interdisciplinary (SOI) perspectives on fair AI. In this paper, we take this dynamic as the starting point to study the tension between computer science (CS) and SOI research. By drawing on STS and CSCW theory, we position fair AI research as a matter of `organizational alignment’: what makes research `doable’ is the successful alignment of three levels of work organization (the social world, the laboratory and the experiment). Based on qualitative interviews with CS researchers, we analyze the tasks, resources, and actors required for doable research in the case of fair AI. We find that CS researchers engage with SOI to some extent, but organizational conditions, articulation work, and ambiguities of the social world constrain the doability of SOI research. Based on our findings, we identify and discuss problems for aligning CS and SOI as fair AI continues to evolve.",

From telepresence systems through field robots for extreme missions to social robots in homes, HRC is becoming a recurring theme across a broad range of CSCW research. Based on the growing interest, we explore the coupling of the fields of CSCW and robotics at this critical time. This paper presents a primary and secondary literature review of CSCW proceedings and venues for robotics research. We identified 29 CSCW papers that contribute to the body of HRC research and analyse the foundations on which these papers rely. Then, we identified 138 papers published in robotics outlets that either (1) cite one or more CSCW papers, or (2) use the term CSCW. We discuss how CSCW is currently contributing to HRC research through five research topics: Sociomateriality, teamwork, awareness, embodiment, and communication. The paper contributes by offering three key future pathways for expanding this area of research, outlining questions and gaps that have yet to be explored for (1) expanding the application domains and diversifying robot types for HRC, (2) methodological implications for HRC, and (3) learning from human collaboration.",

      "abstract": "When discussing difficult topics online, is it common to meaningfully engage with people from diverse perspectives? Why or why not? Could features of the online environment be redesigned to encourage civil conversation across difference? To investigate these questions, we need to explore them in a particular context. In this paper, we study discussions of gun policy on Reddit, with the overarching goal of developing insights into the potential of the internet to support understanding across difference. We use two methods: a clustering analysis of Reddit posts to contribute insights about what people discuss, and an interview study of twenty Reddit users to help us understand why certain kinds of conversation take place and others don't.\n    We find that the discussion of gun politics falls into three groups: conservative pro-gun, liberal pro-gun, and liberal anti-gun. Each type of group has its own characteristic topics. While our subjects state that they would be willing to engage with others across the ideological divide, in practice they rarely do.\n    Subjects are siloed into like-minded subreddits through a two-pronged effect, where they are simultaneously pushed away from opposing-view communities while actively seeking belonging in like-minded ones.\n    Another contributing factor is Reddit's ``karma'' mechanism: fear of being downvoted and losing karma points and social approval of peers causes our subjects to hesitate to say anything in conflict with group norms. The pseudonymous nature of discussion on Reddit plays a complex role, with some subjects finding it freeing and others fearing reprisal from others not bound by face-to-face norms of politeness. Our subjects believe that content moderation can help ameliorate these issues; however, our findings suggest that moderators need different tools to do so effectively. We conclude by suggesting platform design changes that might increase discussion across difference.",

These resources are often designed to be general-purpose, to be applicable to a variety of use cases and contexts; however, this often leads to de-contextualization, where they may lack relevance or specificity for AI practitioners developing particular applications for specific contexts. To understand how AI practitioners may re-contextualize one such responsible AI resource, an AI fairness checklist, for their particular contexts and AI applications, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 AI practitioners from seven organizations. We identify how contextualizing the fairness checklist produces new forms of work for AI practitioners and other stakeholders, as well as opens up new sites for negotiation and contestation via decisions about how to adapt the fairness checklist. As part of this, we identify how this contextualization process may help AI practitioners develop shared language about AI fairness, and we identify tensions in ownership over this process that suggest larger issues for accountability in the work of responsible AI.",

Thus we developed Chirp, an anonymous social media sandbox space designed to explore the underlying effects of disclosure within online spaces. Users in Chirp are prompted to self-disclose moods and emotions using emojis. Through a between-subjects study among a cohort of first-year undergraduate student users on Chirp, we evaluate the effect of self-disclosure within semi-private online spaces on social support. While Chirp use does not show a significant increase in measured feelings of social support, user responses suggest that self-disclosure in Chirp may provide more social support than typical social media use or simple mood tracking over a two-week period. Our findings indicate that even in low-bandwidth communication platforms, self-disclosure may cause increased feelings of social support.

In this paper, we present a mixed-methods analysis aimed at examining whether public discussions were commensurate with the scientific consensus on several COVID-19 issues. We estimate scientific consensus based on samples of abstracts from preprint servers and compare against the volume of public discussions on Twitter mentioning these papers. We find that anti-consensus posts and users, though overall less numerous than pro-consensus ones, are vastly over-represented on Twitter, thus producing a false consensus effect. This transpires with favorable papers being disproportionately amplified, along with an influx of new anti-consensus user sign-ups. Finally, our content analysis highlights that anti-consensus users misrepresent scientific findings or question scientists' integrity in their efforts to substantiate their claims.",

      "abstract": "Meanspo, an antagonistic form of online support within the eating disorder (ED) community, involves the direct solicitation or sharing of aggressive and insulting online content. This study presents findings from a comprehensive qualitative analysis of #meanspo content on X (previously Twitter) from May 2020 (N=752). Our analysis of tweets reveals that posts tagged with #meanspo can be of various natures. While commonly associated with extremely derogatory ED content, more than 80% of posts with the meanspo tag on X were non-aggressive. The study also explores potential inconsistencies in voluntary and involuntary meanspo specific content moderation, prompting inquiries into X's regulatory policies against such content and the distinct online self-presentation strategies employed by community members. Future contextual research is needed to understand the evolving nature of this social phenomenon and its potential clinical impacts on users over time, particularly concerning the unhealthy adoption of such content.

      "abstract": "This paper presents a mixed-methods study of app-based motorcycle taxis in Thailand to explore the social dynamics of rideshare drivers and their exercised autonomy both through social pressure and a hostile work environment. As motorcycle taxis are open-air vehicles, drivers can be exposed to prolonged air pollution and other weather events, potentially impacting their health. In an initial quantitative study of server-side rideshare logs, we unexpectedly found that drivers do not exercise the autonomy provided by their rideshare platform to avoid air pollution events. This prompted a follow-on investigation through semi-structured interviews of drivers and passengers in three provinces that explored both why these drivers fail to experience the autonomy promised to them by gig-work in this context and other examples of harms drivers do not exercise their autonomy to avoid. \n\nOur study sheds light on the social context that may constrain a driver's agency, including financial pressures, weather conditions, conflicts with local taxi organizations, and a false perception that drivers need to work around the ride assignment algorithm to avoid being blacklisted. We find that when leveraging app-based rideshare opportunities, drivers simultaneously perceive increased flexibility in their work hours and a lack of agency to prioritize their health and safety. We conclude with a discussion on potential interventions aimed at mitigating the forces preventing drivers from exercising their autonomy.",

      "abstract": "The entry of on-demand ride-sourcing digital labour platforms (OR-DLPs) in Kolkata, India, restructured the local taxi-cab service industry’s economic geography and spatial practices. Notably, they eroded the significance of the spatial fixity of taxi stands operated by traditional trade unions, enmeshed in local society’s partisan political dynamics. Therefore, OR-DLPs triggered a reconfiguration of the socio-spatial and political practices around the taxi-cab industry in the city. Globally, traditional trade unions have struggled to organise workers in informal work arrangements and DLPs. However, in Kolkata, the Kolkata Ola-Uber App-Cab Operator and Drivers Union has proved to be successful. They established hybrid and networked unionism through technological affordances, placing worker-organisers rather than external organisers at the centre of their organisational structure. Furthermore, they undertook tech-mediated resistance against the OR-DLPs, local bureaucracy (e.g. the police) and the state. We explore this context to examine the impact of OR-DLPs on labour geography, worker-organising and resistance practices, along with the revitalisation strategies of traditional trade unions in response. From a non-Western context, we expand the frame for CSCW and HCI scholars’ ongoing efforts to design worker-centric technologies for resistance.",

      "abstract": "Child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA) online has become a major safety issue for children to access the Internet. To combat CSEA, electronics services providers (ESP) have implemented various mechanisms to detect child sexual abuse materials (CSAM). However, these mechanisms, despite their capability to prevent the mass distribution of CSAM online, may raise significant privacy concerns among general users.\nIn this paper, we conducted a semi-structured interview study with 23 participants to understand their privacy perceptions of two types of online CSAM detection mechanisms. Our results suggested that users were concerned about the transparency of the detection process, inappropriate access to users' data, and unclear boundaries of such mechanisms. Our results also highlight that, even though the majority of participants choose to sacrifice their privacy for societal benefits, they still have privacy concerns that need to be addressed. We discuss the design and policy implications for ESP to improve users' awareness of the data practices of these mechanisms, alleviate users' privacy concerns, and increase societal benefits.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a global health crisis projected to affect one billion people worldwide by 2030. Previous research has emphasized the role of food cues in print media and television as contributing factors to the obesity epidemic. However, the influence of food cues shared by general users on social media platforms, particularly Snapchat, remains largely unexplored. To this end, this paper presents a comprehensive, large-scale study employing a multi-method approach to assess, measure, and mitigate the influence of food cues shared on Snapchat in three different countries with diverse cultural backgrounds: Saudi Arabia, the United States, and France. Our analysis of over 350K collected snaps reveals that food cues are prevalent among Snapchat users, with food content comprising approximately 20% of all collected snaps. Subsequently, we assessed the impact of exposure to Snapchat food content on appetite and examined whether it might inadvertently exacerbate cravings. Our experimental study, involving 37 participants, yields a significant finding: exposure to food snaps leads to a substantial increase in caloric intake. In light of these findings and as an effort to mitigate this impact, this paper sheds light on Snapchat users' perceptions of a proposed intervention design idea, which would allow them to customize their feed and hide food content to potentially reduce their exposure to it. According to our survey of 813 Snapchat users, the majority (57%) indicated they would be willing to hide food-related content from their feeds. In particular, being male and having a high body mass index (BMI) were both associated with a higher willingness to block food content from their Snapchat feed. While food snaps are intended to disappear after 24 hours, our results suggest that their impact can have a long-lasting effect on health and wellness.",

In this exploratory study, we probe why users go to r/ifyoulikeblank, how they look for recommendation, and how the subreddit users respond to recommendation requests. To answer, we collected sample posts from r/ifyoulikeblank and analyzed them using a qualitative approach. Our analysis reveals that users come to this subreddit for various reasons, such as exhausting popular search systems, not knowing what or how to search for an item, and thinking crowd have better knowledge than search systems. Examining users query and their description, we found novel information users provide during recommendation seeking using r/ifyoulikeblank. For example, sometimes they ask for artifacts recommendation based on the tools used to create them. Or, sometimes indicating a recommendation seeker's time constraints can help better suit recommendations to their needs. Finally, recommendation responses and interactions revealed patterns of how requesters and responders refine queries and recommendations.

      "abstract": "Selective exposure has long been a concern of HCI researchers as it can lead to ideological polarization and distrust in society. Efforts have tried to reduce selective exposure online by serving diversified news content, but their effectiveness has been limited by users’ lack of motivation to engage with the diverse content offered. To address this, we design the NewsGuesser system, which leverages the insight that curiosity can\nprompt motivation and engagement, by asking readers to guess the source of their news. In interviews with 40 participants, balanced for partisan affiliation, we use NewsGuesser as a probe tool to explore how guessing affects their perceptions of selective exposure. Participants struggled with the guessing game, which revealed a misalignment between users’ expectations of different news sources and reality. Faced with the visualizations\nof the (often inaccurate) guessing results, participants were able to reflect on their own biases and selective exposure. In a number of cases, the guessing process changed participants’ impressions of news organizations and some expressed an interest in engaging with more diverse news sources. While many also found the guessing game frustrating, the system and interview results suggest a number of new directions for designing social media and news media platforms.",

      "abstract": "Detailed targeting of advertising has long been one of the core offerings of online platforms.  At the same time, various actors have abused the detailed targeting ability to show conflicting messages to different groups of people to drive division, polarization, and even social unrest. Platforms have often responded by removing select targeting attributes such as inferred political leaning or ethnicity. In this work we show that major political advertisers in the U.S. circumvented these limitations during the 2022 midterm elections by targeting proxy attributes: seemingly innocuous targeting criteria that closely correspond to political and racial divides in American society. We introduce novel methods for directly measuring the skew of various targeting criteria to quantify their usefulness as proxies. Our findings have crucial implications for the ongoing discussion on the regulation of political advertising and emphasize the urgency for increased transparency.",

      "abstract": "Organizations often send bulk emails to employees to make them aware of policy changes, organization plans, and events. Many of these emails, however, are long digests with many separate messages that waste employees' time and reduce their awareness. This study introduces CommTool--a prototype tool to help organizational communicators better understand their emails’ performance and cost. We first interviewed 5 communicators and identified the need to measure the performance of each message within bulk email. Then we iteratively designed and deployed an organizational bulk email evaluation platform (CommTool), which enables communicators to get diverse message-level metrics such as reading time, relevance rate, comments, etc. We evaluated these designs through a 2-month field deployment with 5 communicators and 149 organization employees. We found that 1) the message-level metrics, such as reading time and relevance rate, helped communicators understand their audience and design bulk emails; 2) the cost and reputation metrics did not influence the organization leaders' decisions. We summarize with suggestions on designing organizational bulk email evaluation platforms that provide message-level performance and cost information.",

Unfortunately, journalists also regularly endure significant online harassment on social media platforms, ranging from personal attacks to doxxing to threats of physical harm. In this paper, we seek to understand how to make social media usable for journalists who face constant digital harassment. To begin, we conduct a set of need-finding interviews with Asian American and Pacific Islander journalists to understand where existing platform tools and newsroom resources fall short in adequately protecting journalists, especially those of marginalized identities. We map journalists' unmet needs to concrete design goals, which we use to build PressProtect, an interface that provides journalists greater agency when engaging with readers on Twitter/X. Through user testing with eight journalists, we evaluate PressProtect and find that participants felt it effectively protected them against harassment and could also generalize to serve other visible and vulnerable groups. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and recommendations for social platforms hoping to build defensive defaults for journalists facing online harassment.",

In this study, we investigated the nature and harms of networked harassment on Twitter through design workshops (n = 11) and developed a set of design goals focusing on empowering the individual to fight back against harassment. We designed Re:SPect, an anti-harassment tool promoting scalable and active responses to networked harassment. We evaluated Re:SPect through a simulated scenario-based study with Twitter users (n = 18) who had directly or indirectly experienced networked harassment. Our findings reveal that users felt safer and more empowered as Re:SPect enabled them to manage interactions with a larger audience. Users felt less anxious about the potential of being harassed, while the summarization features of Re:SPect allowed users to perceive the situation more objectively. Based on the findings, we discuss how Re:SPect's features could be utilized in promoting healthier online discussion, as well as theoretical implications in designing such systems.",

      "abstract": "Online harassment remains a prevalent problem for internet users. Its impact is made orders of magnitude worse when multiple harassers coordinate to conduct networked attacks. This paper presents an analysis of 231 threads in Kiwi Farms, a notorious online harassment community. We find that networked online harassment campaigns consists of three phases: target introduction, network decision, and network response. The first stage consists of the initial narrative elements, that are approved or not in stage two and expanded in stage three. Narrative building is a common element of all three stages. The network plays a key role in narrative building, adding elements to the narrative in at least 80 % of the threads, resulting in sustained harassment. This finding is central to our model of Continuous Narrative Escalation (CNE), that has two parts: (1) narrative continuation, the action of repeatedly adding new information to the existing narrative and (2) escalation, the aggravation of harassment that occurs as a consequence.\n\nIn addition, we present insights from our analysis of 100 takedown requests threads, discussing received abuse reports. We find that these takedown requests are misused by the community and are used as elements to further fuel the narrative. We use our findings and framework to come up with a set of recommendations, that can inform harassment interventions and make online spaces safer.",

      "abstract": "Recent work in CHI and CSCW has devoted increasing attention to how the design of network hospitality platforms shapes user experiences and relational outcomes. In this article, I interrogate how different risk factors emerge based on the type of exchanges these platforms facilitate. To do so, I juxtapose two prominent network hospitality platforms—one facilitating negotiated exchange (i.e., Airbnb) with another facilitating reciprocal exchange (i.e., Couchsurfing) between users. Homing in on sexual risk, an underexplored form of platform danger, and drawing on interviews with 40 female dual-platform users, I argue that Airbnb’s provision of binding negotiated exchange and institutional safeguards reduces risk through three mechanisms: casting initial guest-host relation into a buyer-seller arrangement, stabilizing interactional scripts, and formalizing sexual violence recourse. Conversely, Couchsurfing’s focus on reciprocal exchange and lack of safeguards increases sexual precarity for users both on- and off-platform. This study demonstrates how platforms with strong prosocial motivations can jeopardize sociality and concludes with implications for designs that better protect vulnerable user populations.",

While NCIM has received attention in legal, psychological, and communication fields over the past decade, it is not sufficiently addressed in computing scholarship. This paper addresses this gap by linking NCIM harms to the specific technological components that facilitate them. We introduce the sociotechnical stack, a conceptual framework designed to map the technical stack to its corresponding social impacts. The sociotechnical stack allows us to analyze sociotechnical problems like NCIM, and points toward opportunities for computing research. We propose a research roadmap for computing and social computing communities to deter NCIM perpetration and support victim-survivors through building and rebuilding technologies.",

These collaborations must also draw upon and accommodate a host of processes and resources. In this paper, we present results from a qualitative case study of a key policy and process document for a large design project for a civic traffic management system that must serve multiple organizations and government agencies. The document is one common to systems engineering, but less familiar to CSCW: the Concept of Operations (ConOps). We describe the sociotechnical design functions of the ConOps. We also analyze the document and its developmental process using Ewenstein and Whyte's concept of “epistemic objects,” which has been useful for CSCW and design research scholars to understand the roles artifacts play in the messy processes of design and cooperative work. We find that the ConOps exhibits many qualities of an epistemic object and supports the deeply integrated work of \"designing\" both the system and the interorganizational collaboration itself. We then explore avenues for future research in similarly complex infrastructural design settings.",

      "abstract": "Usability is a crucial factor but one of the most neglected concerns in open source software (OSS). While far from an ideal approach, a common practice that OSS communities adopt to collaboratively address usability is through discussions on issue tracking systems (ITSs). However, there is little knowledge about the extent to which OSS community members engage in usability issue discussions, the aspects of usability they frequently target, and the characteristics of their collaboration around usability issue discussions. This knowledge is important for providing practical recommendations and research directions to better support OSS communities in addressing this important topic and improve OSS usability in general. To help achieve this goal, we performed an extensive empirical study on issues discussed in five popular OSS applications: three data science notebook projects (Jupyter Lab, Google Colab, and CoCalc) and two code editor projects (VSCode and Atom). Our results indicated that while usability issues are extensively discussed in the OSS projects, their scope tended to be limited to efficiency and aesthetics. Additionally, these issues are more frequently posted by experienced community members and display distinguishable characteristics, such as involving more visual communication and more participants. Our results provide important implications that can inform the OSS practitioners to better engage the community in usability issue discussion and shed light on future research efforts toward collaboration techniques and tools for discussing niche topics in diverse communities, such as the usability issues in the OSS context.",

      "abstract": "Research on data annotation for artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated that biases, power, and culture impact the ways that annotators apply labels to data and subsequently affect downstream AI systems. However, annotators can only apply labels that are available to them in the annotation classification scheme. Drawing on a 3-year ethnographic study of an R&D collaboration between medical researchers and AI researchers, we argue that the construction of the classification schema itself—decisions about what kinds of data can and cannot be collected, what activities can and cannot be detected in the data, what the possible annotation classes ought to be, and the rules by which an item ought to be classified into each class—dramatically shape the annotation process, and through it, the AI. We draw on the Bowker and Star (2000) classification theory to detail how the creation of a training data codebook for a computer vision algorithm in hospital intensive care units (ICUs) evolved from its original, clinically-driven goal of classifying complex clinical activities into a narrower goal of identifying physical objects and simpler activities in the ICU. This work reinforces how trade-offs and decisions made long before annotators begin labeling data are highly consequential to the resulting AI system.",

      "abstract": "Proponents of legal automation believe that translating the law into code can improve the legal system. However, research and reporting suggest that legal software systems often contain flawed translations of the law, resulting in serious harms such as terminating children’s healthcare and charging innocent people with fraud. Efforts to identify and contest these mistranslations after they arise treat the symptoms of the problem, but fail to prevent these mistranslations from emerging. Meanwhile, recommendations to improve the development of legal software remain speculative, as there is little empirical evidence about the translation process itself. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of fifteen teams---nine composed of only computer scientists and six of computer scientists and legal experts---as they attempt to translate a bankruptcy statute into software. Through an interpretative qualitative analysis, we characterize a significant epistemic divide between computer science and law and demonstrate that this divide contributes to errors, misunderstandings, and policy distortions in the development of legal software. Even when development teams included legal experts, communication breakdowns meant that the resulting tools predominantly presented incorrect legal advice and adopted inappropriately harsh legal standards. Participants did not recognize the errors in the tools they created. We encourage policymakers and researchers to approach legal software with greater skepticism, as the disciplinary divide between computer science and law creates an endemic source of error and mistranslation in the production of legal software.",

However, gaps remain in our understanding of workers’ scheduling preferences and practices, which we aim to fill in this large-scale, mixed-methods study of individuals calendars in a multinational organization. Using interviews with eight participants, survey data from 165 respondents, and telemetry data from millions of meetings scheduled by 211 thousand workers, we characterize scheduling preferences, practices, and their relationship with each other and organizational factors. We find that temporal preferences can be broadly classified as either cyclical, such as suitability of certain days, or relational, such as dispersed meetings, at various time scales. Furthermore, our results suggest that these preferences are disconnected from actual practice – albeit with several notable exceptions – and that individual differences are associated with factors like meeting load, time-zones, importance of meetings to job function, and job titles. We discuss key themes for our findings, along with the implications for calendar and scheduling systems and socio-technical systems more broadly.",

      "abstract": "Algorithms are introducing changes to individuals’ jobs, but do algorithms also lead to changes in the structures of organizations themselves?  Organizational structures, as often formalized into organization (org) charts, are meant to facilitate coordinated decision-making. Yet our 10-month ethnographic study of a large online retail company reveals why the organizational structures that facilitate effective decision-making by humans may be in tension with the organizational structures that facilitate effective decision-making using algorithms. Our findings show that the human decision-makers needed small, divided-up sets of decisions, and they had previously accomplished this through how they structured individuals’ roles and teams in the org chart. In contrast, when data scientists developed a new algorithm and first deployed it within organizational structures meant to support human decision-making, they realized that these small divided-up decision spaces were arbitrarily constraining the algorithm’s search space. When not constrained in this manner, the algorithm could identify and recommend better solutions, but those optimal solutions did not always align with the structure of roles and teams in the org chart.  This study suggests that as algorithms are integrated into the workplace, organization designs may begin to more explicitly reflect the contours of those algorithms' behaviors.",

The HCI literature addresses both material mediation for individuals and coordination between collaborators – but rarely does it discuss the more direct role of the material as standing between people: its communicative role. This paper unfolds a material/linguistic analysis of four empirical examples from previous work on collaborative writing to showcase how material qualities of both tools and the text-in-progress, used in both planned and improvised manners, help co-authors shift between levels of collaboration, from independent co-ordinated activity to highly collaborative co-constructive activity. On one hand, we see co-authors successfully collaborating through material means; on the other, we see frustrations resulting from limited material expressivity in current tools. This duality between the significance of material mediation and obstacles to drawing on its potential makes clear that our conception of materiality needs elaboration. We point to multimodality as one opportunity for this.",

Like optical illusions, humans are prone to drawing causal relations between events that are only coincidental (i.e., causal illusions). Researchers in domains such as cognitive psychology and healthcare often use logistically expensive experiments to understand causal beliefs and illusions. In this paper, we propose Belief Miner, a crowdsourcing method for evaluating people’s causal beliefs and illusions. Our method uses the (dis)similarities between the causal relations collected from the crowds and experts to surface the causal beliefs and illusions. Through an iterative design process, we developed a web-based interface for collecting causal relations from a target population. We then conducted a crowdsourced experiment with 101 workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific using this interface and analyzed the collected data with Belief Miner. We discovered a variety of causal beliefs and potential illusions, and we report the design implications for future research.",

Taking a necessary step towards improving OSH collaboration, we conduct a detailed case study of DrawBot, a successful OSH project that remarkably fostered a long-term collaboration on Thingiverse - a platform not explicitly intended for complex collaborative design. Through analyzing comment threads and design changes over the course of the project, we found how collaboration occurred, the challenges faced, and how the DrawBot community managed to overcome these obstacles. Beyond offering a detailed account of collaboration practices and challenges, our work contributes best practices, design implications, and practical implications for OSH project maintainers, platform builders, and researchers, respectively. With these insights and our publicly available dataset, we aim to foster more effective and efficient collaborative design in OSH projects.",

However, along with traditional details like photos, a description of the property, and a price, these platform listings include supplementary information in the form of scores or ratings of schools, walkability, and crime. This information is presented with little explanatory context, as a simple numerical score or shaded map implying a hierarchy from better to worse. While these scores and maps are presented as self-evident, my research shows that people interpreted the scores in considerably varied ways.  Different users, for example, could draw opposing conclusions from the same data. I present findings from 32 interviews with real estate platform users. In the context of housing decisions, I found people readily inferred meanings about protected groups, particularly about the racial makeup of neighborhoods. The use of maps and scores on online real estate platforms raises questions and concerns about their broader societal consequences. While real estate platforms likely consider their role to be a provider of information principally to an audience of people buying, selling, and renting real estate, I argue that they have become a form of consequential civic data with the potential to reshape urban life. Some real estate platforms are beginning to recognize this, removing sensitive information about crime, and acknowledging that they cannot present it effectively or responsibly.",

      "abstract": "In 2011, the United Nations declared Internet access to be a basic human right. Achieving universal access has long been a goal of governments throughout the world, including the United States (US), where the provision of access depends primarily on decisions made by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) guided in part by commercial market concerns. To encourage deployment in underserved regions, the US federal government has recently allocated unprecedented funding, with distributions guided by the information in broadband maps, spatial representations of current Internet access and quality published by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC). Yet, these maps are known to be inaccurate, especially for populations that are marginalized, such as tribal and rural residents. We are interested in the collaborative and contentious efforts to repair the data contained in broadband maps, and particularly by the efforts of citizen groups and local government to counter claims made by ISPs. We do so via an interview study of 14 individuals involved in various local and regional roles, in policy, IT, advocacy, and research. We draw upon frameworks of repair and of data activism to ask who does this work and why; what tangible and intangible tools are brought to bear; and how does the structural context simultaneously empower and burden repair workers. In doing so, we make three contributions: (i) we critique the process and system for broadband map repair for the burdens it places on historically marginalized groups to demonstrate how they have been left out of expansion and how their experiences are otherwise silent in official records; (ii) we bring together analytical concepts from repair and data arenas to examine repair work that is substantially shaped by socio, political, and economic context; (iii) we illustrate how viewing broadband data workers as activists reveals the inadequacy of current tools and the opportunity for better support for their long-term, contextualized, and mediated efforts.",

      "abstract": "Prior research in psychology has found that people’s decisions are often inconsistent. An individual’s decisions vary across time, and decisions vary even more across people. Inconsistencies have been identified not only in subjective matters, like matters of taste, but also in settings one might expect to be more objective, such as sentencing, job performance evaluations, or real estate appraisals. In our study, we explore whether algorithmic decision aids can be used to moderate the degree of inconsistency in human decision-making in the context of real estate appraisal. In a large-scale human-subject experiment, we study how different forms of algorithmic assistance influence the way that people review and update their estimates of real estate prices. We find that both (i) asking respondents to review their estimates in a series of algorithmically chosen pairwise comparisons and (ii) providing respondents with traditional machine advice are effective strategies for influencing human responses. Compared to simply reviewing initial estimates one by one, the aforementioned strategies lead to (i) a higher propensity to update initial estimates, (ii) a higher accuracy of post-review estimates, and (iii) a higher degree of consistency between the post-review estimates of different respondents. While these effects are more pronounced with traditional machine advice, the approach of reviewing algorithmically chosen pairs can be implemented in a wider range of settings, since it does not require access to ground truth data.",

This study investigates the experiences of disabled individuals within the collaborative ideation process, specifically examining their utilization of digital whiteboarding tools. Through interviews with 19 professionals and academics with disabilities, alongside a thematic analysis of online forum posts for two popular digital whiteboarding platforms (Miro and Figma), we delve into the access barriers encountered by disabled individuals and the strategies they employ to create access in collaborative ideation. Our findings illuminate the multifaceted nature of access barriers, encompassing issues such as inaccessible visual features, technology-induced discomfort, unstructured nature of freeform content, and complex communication setups. Furthermore, we uncover the intricate dynamics involved in negotiating diverse access needs and conflicts within teams involving people with different disabilities. Through this analysis, we highlight tensions around proficiency with inaccessible technologies stemming from ableist standards of professional success and discuss the implications of our findings for the design of accessible collaborative ideation systems.",

The introduction of autonomous systems (or in the widest sense “artificial intelligence”, AI) will fundamentally impact work practices. However, while most existing models of human-AI collaboration focus on performance goals, less is known about their potential influence on job satisfaction. In this paper, we present an online experiment in which we compared the perception of job meaningfulness and accountability in a human-AI collaboration across three interaction paradigms: Supervisory, Advisory, and Interactive. Our results showed that, unlike the common notion of supervisory control, people find their job more satisfying when they directly interact with the AI and are involved and remain accountable for action and decision-making. Introducing AI as a teammate in the interactive paradigm was associated with the highest job meaningfulness.",

      "abstract": "Collaborative problem solving (CPS) competence is considered one of the essential 21st-century skills. To facilitate the assessment and learning of CPS competence, researchers have proposed a series of frameworks to conceptualize CPS and explored ways to make sense of the complex processes involved in collaborative problem solving. However, encoding explicit behaviors into subskills within the frameworks of CPS skills is still a challenging task. Traditional studies have relied on manual coding to decipher behavioral data for CPS, but such coding methods can be very time-consuming and cannot support real-time analyses. Scholars have begun to explore approaches for constructing automatic coding models. Nevertheless, the existing models built using machine learning or deep learning techniques depend on a large amount of training data and have relatively low accuracy. To address these problems, this paper proposes a prompt-based learning pre-trained model. The model can achieve high performance even with limited training data. In this study, three experiments were conducted, and the results showed that our model not only produced the highest accuracy, macro F1 score, and kappa values on large training sets, but also performed the best on small training sets of the CPS behavioral data. The application of the proposed prompt-based learning pre-trained model contributes to the CPS skills coding task and can also be used for other CSCW coding tasks to replace manual coding.",

      "abstract": "AI is anticipated to enhance human decision-making in high-stakes domains like aviation, but adoption is often hindered by challenges such as inappropriate reliance and poor alignment with users' decision-making. Recent research suggests that a core underlying issue is the recommendation-centric design of many AI systems, i.e., they give end-to-end recommendations and ignore the rest of the decision-making process. Alternative support paradigms are rare, and it remains unclear how the few that do exist compare to recommendation-centric support. In this work, we aimed to empirically compare recommendation-centric support to an alternative paradigm, continuous support, in the context of diversions in aviation. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 32 professional pilots in a realistic setting. To ensure the quality of our study scenarios, we conducted a focus group with four additional pilots prior to the study. We found that continuous support can support pilots' decision-making in a forward direction, allowing them to think more beyond the limits of the system and make faster decisions when combined with recommendations, though the forward support can be disrupted. Participants' statements further suggest a shift in design goal away from providing recommendations, to supporting quick information gathering. Our results show ways to design more helpful and effective AI decision support that goes beyond end-to-end recommendations.",

We then offer two case studies exemplifying the emergence of algorithmic subjectivities: one involving computational topic modeling of blogs written by parents with children on the autism spectrum and one involving algorithmic moderation of social media content. Drawing on these case studies, we then articulate a series of qualities that characterizes algorithmic subjectivities. We also compare and contrast these qualities with a number of related concepts from prior literature to articulate how algorithmic subjectivities constitute a novel theoretical contribution, as well as how it offers a focal lens for future empirical investigation and for design. In short, this article points out how certain worlds are being made and/or being made possible via algorithmic systems, and it asks Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) to consider what other worlds might be possible.",

HCI and social computing scholarship draw on visibility to theorize self-presentation management; while research addresses how social media users leverage (in)visibility for self-presentation goals, how users perceive and assess the visibility of themselves and others merits investigation. We conducted interviews (n=20) to explore how U.S.-based social media users perceive and assess self visibility. Findings indicate that self visibility comprises a set of related objects’ visibility—content, persons, and identity—associated with distinct, but related, visibility attributes. We develop the visibility objects lens to examine self-presentation, contributing a unified social media visibility framework. We show how users perceive themselves as visible to platforms and algorithms, which act as visibility agents. We introduce reflected algorithmic visibility to describe awareness of visibility to platforms and algorithms informed by algorithmic feedback. We conclude with design implications of a visibility objects lens.",

      "abstract": "GIFs afford a high degree of personalization, as they are often created from popular movie and video clips with diverse and realistic characters, each expressing a nuanced emotional state through a combination of characters' own unique bodily gestures and distinctive visual backgrounds. These properties of high personalization and embodiment provide a unique window for exploring how individuals represent and express themselves on social media through the lens of the GIFs they use. In this study, we explore how Twitter users express their gender and racial identities through characters in GIFs. We conducted a behavioral study (n=398) to simulate a series of tweeting and GIF-picking scenarios. We annotated the gender and race identities of GIF characters, and we found that gender and race identities have significant impacts on users' GIF choices: men chose more gender-matching GIFs than women, and White participants chose more race-matching GIFs than Black participants. We also found that users' prior familiarity with the source of a GIF and perceptions about the composition of the audience (viz., having a matching identity) have significant effects on whether a user will choose race- and gender-matching GIFs. This work has implications for practitioners supporting personalized social identity construction and impression management mechanisms online.",

Yet, the effects of participating in and conducting research about sensitive data with youth are poorly understood. We conducted meta-level research to improve our understanding of these \\edit{effects. We did the following:} (i) asked youth (aged 13-21) to share their private Instagram Direct Messages (DMs) and flag their unsafe DMs; (ii) interviewed 30 participants about the experience of reflecting on this sensitive data; (iii) interviewed research assistants (RAs, n=12) about their experience analyzing youth's data. We found that reflecting about DMs brought discomfort for participants and RAs, although both benefited from increasing their awareness about online risks, their behavior, and privacy and social media practices. Participants had high expectations for safeguarding their private data while their concerns were mitigated by the potential to improve online safety. \nWe provide implications for ethical research practices and the development of reflective practices among participants and RAs through applying trauma-informed principles to HCI research.",

Family dynamics, death, and taboo further mean that individuals often miss out on information that could help them contextualize their experiences. We examine participant experiences with menopause and explore designs of digital and non-digital legacies for sharing menopause experiences across generations. We conducted semi-structured interviews and design sessions with 17 participants who experienced or are experiencing menopause. We report participant information needs and sense-making practices, including what personalized information participants wish to pass down and preferred formats for intergenerational sharing. We discuss the potential of using storytelling and life-logging to create ``holistic'' memories of the menopause journey, to support self-reflection, and for using legacies to initiate conversations about marginalized health experiences. We identify future design and research opportunities for the HCI and CSCW communities to support intergenerational sharing of non-medicalized and stigmatized health experiences.",

Risk profiles were first created based on the survey data and then compared with the risk-flagged social media data. Five risk profiles emerged: Low Risks (51% of the participants), Medium Risks (29%), Increased Sexting (8%), Increased Self-Harm (8%), and High Risk Perpetration (4%). Overall, the profiles correlated well with the social media data with the highest level of risk occurring in the three smallest profiles. Youth who experienced increased sexting and self-harm frequently reported engaging in unsafe sexual conversations. Meanwhile, high risk perpetration was characterized by increased violence, threats, and sales/promotion of illegal activities. A key insight from our study was that offline risk behavior sometimes manifested differently in online contexts (i.e., offline self-harm as risky online sexual interactions). Our findings highlight the need for targeted risk prevention strategies for youth online safety.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, many mobile instant messenger (MIM) users employ stickers to express their emotions. Due to the increase in the variety of stickers, many MIM platforms have begun to offer sticker recommendation services, which suggest appropriate stickers based on the context of conversations. Although sticker recommendation services need to consider users’ subtle social and psychological needs from the perspective that stickers are an alternative communication language, few attempts have been made to explore this area. Consequently, we investigated sticker usage practices through a qualitative study with 18 KakaoTalk users in South Korea. Based on the results of this study, we revealed user's three common considerations in sticker usage experiences and discussed the design implications for sticker recommendation services in MIM.",

Recently, rapid growth has transformed that interface in many fields of computing. In this work, we examine the effects of this growth from a media archaeology perspective, through the changes to figures and tables in research papers. Specifically, we study these changes in computer vision over the past decade, as the deep learning revolution has driven unprecedented growth in the discipline. We ground our investigation through interviews with veteran researchers spanning computer vision, graphics and visualization. Our analysis focuses on the research attention economy: how research paper elements contribute towards advertising, measuring and disseminating an increasingly commodified ``contribution.'' Through this work, we seek to motivate future discussion surrounding the design of both the research paper itself as well as the larger sociotechnical research publishing system, including tools for finding, reading and writing research papers.",

      "abstract": "Image search is an essential and user-friendly method to explore vast galleries of digital images. However, existing image search methods heavily rely on proximity measurements like tag matching or image similarity, requiring precise user inputs for satisfactory results. To meet the growing demand for a contemporary image search engine that enables accurate comprehension of users’ search intentions, we introduce an innovative user intent expansion framework. Our framework leverages visual-language models to parse and compose multi-modal user inputs to provide more accurate and satisfying results. It comprises two-stage processes: 1) a parsing stage that incorporates a language parsing module with large language models to enhance the comprehension of textual inputs, along with a visual parsing module that integrates an interactive segmentation module to swiftly identify detailed visual elements within images; and 2) a logic composition stage that combines multiple user search intents into a unified logic expression for more sophisticated operations in complex searching scenarios. Moreover, the intent expansion framework enables users to perform flexible contextualized interactions with the search results to further specify or adjust their detailed search intents iteratively. We implemented the framework into an image search system for NFT (non-fungible token) search and conducted a user study to evaluate its usability and novel properties. The results indicate that the proposed framework significantly improves users' image search experience. Particularly the parsing and contextualized interactions prove useful in allowing users to express their search intents more accurately and engage in a more enjoyable iterative search experience.",

One way colonialism has impacted how people see themselves is through nationalism, where nationalism is often understood through shared language, culture, religion, and geopolitical borders. The way colonialism has shaped people's experiences with nationalism has shaped historical conflicts between members of different nation-states for a long time. While recent social computing research has studied how colonially marginalized people can engage in discourse to decolonize or re-imagine and reclaim themselves and their communities on their own terms--what is less understood is how technology can better support decolonial discourses in an effort to re-imagine nationalism. To understand this phenomenon, this research draws on a semi-structured interview study with YouTubers who make videos about culturally Bengali people whose lives were upended as a product of colonization and are now dispersed across Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. This research seeks to understand people's motivations and strategies for engaging in video-mediated decolonial discourse in transnational contexts. We discuss how our work demonstrates the potential of the sociomateriality of decolonial discourse online and extends an invitation to foreground complexities of nationalism in social computing research.",

      "abstract": "UX designers and researchers who work with AI/ML face different kinds of challenges throughout the design process. Though close collaborations with AI/ML developers and data scientists could address some of these challenges, such interdisciplinary collaborations are non-routine and hard to realize. In this work, we investigate barriers for effective collaboration with ML practitioners, how they affect UX practice of AI/ML applications, and what UX practitioners need to overcome these challenges. We conducted a qualitative study with 14 UX practitioners who are working on AI/ML products as designers or researchers. Our findings show that UX practitioners face challenges in communication, understanding the model and model development processes, establishing ways to collaborate, and reconciling model-centric metrics of evaluation with user-centric outcomes. They described various needs in terms of more visibility into model development processes, access to comprehensible and contextual model information, and hypothetical tools that can potentially support collaboration with ML practitioners and enhance UX design processes. We discuss implications of this research for designing collaborative tools and empowering UX practitioners.",

      "abstract": "UX research practitioners analyze qualitative data to comprehend users’ needs and synthesize design implications for software systems. Collaborating with multiple stakeholders is inevitable for these professionals and adds additional pressure to their already laborious data analysis tasks. In this paper, we investigate how these practitioners’ multi-stakeholder collaboration affects their data analysis practices. Specifically, we investigate the challenges qualitative UX research (QUXR) practitioners face, limitations of the current qualitative data analysis (QDA) support tools they use, and design implications for future QDA tools to address the limitations. Through semi-structured interviews combined with diagramming activities with thirteen industry QUXR practitioners, we have\nrevealed that collaboration becomes a bigger challenge than data analysis and that it often leads to (1) preferring simple tools despite the QDA specialized tools’ beneficial features and (2) wanting to triangulate their work to convince stakeholders. Finally, we have synthesized these results and suggest design implications for QDA support tools.",

A series of studies explored how example galleries could be constructed to help novices learn key design principles. Study 1 revealed that novices gain perspective by observing and searching the evolution of other's design process. Study 2 found that novices are better at identifying design issues when viewing example pairs that improve by one principle rather than multiple. Building on these insights, we created ProcessGallery, a tool that enables users to browse contrasting pairs of early-and-late iterations of designs that highlight key improvements organized by design principles. In Study 3, participants iterated on a seed design after viewing examples in ProcessGallery versus a traditional gallery. Using ProcessGallery, participants found more appropriate examples, were better at assessing designs, and significantly preferred the tool for learning.",

Due to models' extensive reliance on fresh data, the operationalization of machine learning, or MLOps, requires MLEs to have proficiency in data science and engineering. When considered holistically, the job seems staggering---how do MLEs do MLOps, and what are their unaddressed challenges? To address these questions, we conducted semi-structured ethnographic interviews with 18 MLEs working on various applications, including chatbots, autonomous vehicles, and finance. We find that MLEs engage in a workflow of (i) data preparation, (ii) experimentation, (iii) evaluation throughout a multi-staged deployment, and (iv) continual monitoring and response. Throughout this workflow, MLEs collaborate extensively with data scientists, product stakeholders, and one another, supplementing routine verbal exchanges with communication tools ranging from Slack to organization-wide ticketing and reporting systems. We introduce the 3Vs of MLOps: velocity, visibility, and versioning---three virtues of successful ML deployments that MLEs learn to balance and grow as they mature. Finally, we discuss design implications and opportunities for future work.",

      "abstract": "As content moderation becomes a central aspect of all social media platforms and online communities, interest has grown in how to make moderation decisions contestable. On social media platforms where individual communities moderate their own activities, the responsibility to address user appeals falls on volunteers from within the community. While there is a growing body of work devoted to understanding and supporting the volunteer moderators' workload, little is known about their practice of handling user appeals. Through a collaborative and iterative design process with Reddit moderators, we found that moderators spend considerable effort investigating user ban appeals and desire to directly engage with users and retain their agency over each decision. To fulfill their needs, we designed and built AppealMod, a system that induces friction in the appeals process by asking users to provide additional information before their appeals are reviewed by human moderators. In addition to giving moderators more information, we expected the friction in the appeal process would lead to a selection effect among users, with many insincere and toxic appeals being abandoned before getting any attention from human moderators. To evaluate our system, we conducted a randomized field experiment in a Reddit community of over 29 million users that lasted for four months. As a result of the selection effect, moderators viewed only 30% of initial appeals and less than 10% of the toxically worded appeals; yet they granted roughly the same number of appeals when compared with the control group. Overall, our system is effective at reducing moderator workload and minimizing their exposure to toxic content while honoring their preference for direct engagement and agency in appeals.",

Covert behaviors, such as trolling, are especially challenging to detect automatically, because they utilize deceptive strategies to manipulate conversation. We illustrate a novel approach to their detection: analyzing conversational structures instead of focusing only on messages in isolation. Building on conversation analysis, we demonstrate that (1) conversational actions and their norms provide concepts for a deeper understanding of covert disruption, and that (2) machine learning, natural language processing and structural analysis of conversation can complement message-level features to create models that surpass earlier approaches to trolling detection. Our models, developed for detecting overt (aggression) as well as covert (trolling) behaviors using prior studies’ message-level features and new conversational action features, achieved high accuracies (0.90 and 0.92, respectively). The findings offer a theoretically grounded approach to computationally analyzing social media interaction and novel methods for effectively detecting covert disruptive conversations online.",

However, scholars have documented numerous biases and inaccuracies in search outputs. To improve the quality of search results, search engines employ various content moderation practices such as interface elements informing users about potentially dangerous websites and algorithmic mechanisms for downgrading or removing low-quality search results. While the reliance of the public on web search engines and their use of moderation practices is well-established, user attitudes towards these practices have not yet been explored in detail. To address this gap, we first conducted an overview of content moderation practices used by search engines, and then surveyed a representative sample of the US adult population (N=398) to examine the levels of support for different moderation practices applied to potentially misleading and/or potentially offensive content in web search. We also analyzed the relationship between user characteristics and their support for specific moderation practices. We find that the most supported practice is informing users about potentially misleading or offensive content, and the least supported one is the complete removal of search results. More conservative users and users with lower levels of trust in web search results are more likely to be against content moderation in web search.",

However, permanent suspension does not signify the end of a user's online presence, but rather on that specific platform. This issue is particularly salient for influential users with large audiences, as they have the potential to cause substantial shifts in the overall social media information landscape when suspended. Our work employs a mixed methods approach to study the context around, and behavioral patterns after, permanent suspension. We find that migration is a common step after suspension, and characterize a number of behavioral strategies and patterns that occur after influential users are suspended.  By focusing on consequences of suspension across more holistically, we have identified numerous opportunities for design and future research to mitigate the potential negative effects of permanent suspensions on the broader social media information landscape.",

      "abstract": "Privacy is an important topic in HCI and social computing research, and the theory of contextual integrity (CI) is increasingly used to understand how sociotechnical systems—and the new kinds of information flows they introduce—can violate privacy. In empirical research, CI can serve as a conceptual framework for explaining the contextual nature of privacy as well as an analytical framework for evaluating privacy attitudes and behaviors. Analytical applications of CI in HCI primarily employ quantitative methods to identify appropriate information flows but rarely engage with the full CI framework to evaluate such flows. In this paper, we present a roadmap to guide HCI and social computing researchers on how to apply the full CI framework to qualitative projects. To help researchers envision what such an analysis can look like, each step includes an example analysis using interview data from projects on privacy and fitness tracking. We conclude by discussing how harnessing the full CI framework can address critiques of CI and identify opportunities for further theory development.",

      "abstract": "Transformative media fandom is a remarkably coherent, long-lived, and diverse community united primarily by shared engagement in the varied activities of fandom. Its social norms are highly-developed and frequently debated, and have been studied by the CSCW and Media Studies communities in the past, but rarely using the tools and theories of privacy, despite fannish norms often bearing strongly on privacy. We use privacy scholarship and existing theories thereof to examine these norms and bring an additional perspective to understanding fandom communities. In this work, we analyze over 250,000 words of \"meta'' essays and comments on those essays, reflecting the views and debates of hundreds of fans on these privacy norms. Drawing on Solove's theory of privacy as an aggregation of different ideas and on a variety of other academic theories of privacy, we analyze these norms as highly effective at protecting the integrity of fannish activities. We then articulate the value of studying these sorts of diverse \"activity-defined'' communities, arguing that such approaches grant us greater power to understand privacy experiences in ways that are specific, contextual, and intersectional yet still generalizable where possible.",

We conducted a user study with ten families (n=30) in a smart home testbed to observe how our system supports data reflection of the affective and behavioral states among family members. Our findings showed that FamilyScope facilitated family data reflection on the affective and behavioral aspects of family interactions. Overall, families reported that the system well reflected family members' general tendencies in terms of affective and behavioral responses and even helped them gain new insights about each other. Based on the findings, we provide practical design approaches for co-reflection in family informatics systems.",

      "abstract": "Social Virtual Reality (VR), where people meet in virtual spaces via 3D avatars, is used by children and adults alike. Children experience new forms of harassment in social VR where it is often inaccessible to parental oversight. To date, there is limited understanding of how parents and non-parent adults within the child social VR ecosystem perceive the appropriateness of social VR for different age groups and the measures in place to safeguard children. We present results of a mixed-methods questionnaire (N=149 adults, including 79 parents) focusing on encounters with children in social VR and perspectives towards children's use of social VR. We draw novel insights on the frequency of social VR use by children under 13 and current use of, and future aspirations for, child protection interventions. Compared to non-parent adults, parents familiar with social VR propose lower minimum ages and are more likely to allow social VR without supervision. Adult users experience immaturity from children in social VR, while children face abuse, encounter age-inappropriate behaviours and self-disclose to adults. We present directions to enhance the safety of social VR through pre-planned controls, real-time oversight, post-event insight and the need for evidence-based guidelines to support parents and platforms around age-appropriate interventions.",

      "abstract": "Children are exposed to technology at home and school at very young ages, often using family mobile devices and educational apps. It is therefore critical that they begin learning about privacy and security concepts during their elementary school years, rather than waiting until they are older. Such skills will help children navigate an increasingly connected world and develop agency over their personal data, online interactions, and online security. In this paper, we explore how a simple technique---a ''Would Your Rather'' (WYR) game involving hypothetical privacy and security scenarios---can support children in working through the nuances of these types of situations and how educators can leverage this approach to support children's privacy and security learning. We conducted three focus groups with 21 children aged 7-12 using the WYR activity and interviewed 13 elementary school teachers about the use of WYR for facilitating privacy and security learning. We found that WYR provided a meaningful opportunity for children to assess privacy and security risks, consider some of the social and emotional aspects of privacy and security dilemmas, and assert their agency in a manner typically unavailable to children in an adult-centric society. Teachers highlighted connections between privacy and security dilemmas and children's social and emotional learning and offered additional insights about using this WYR technique in and beyond their classrooms. Based on these findings, we highlight four opportunities for using WYR to support children in engaging with privacy and security concepts from an early age.",

      "abstract": "Human social interactions occur in group settings of varying sizes and locations, depending on the type of social activity. The ability to distinguish group formations based on their purposes transforms how group detection mechanisms function. Not only should such tools support the effective detection of serendipitous encounters, but they can derive categories of relation types among users. Determining who is involved, what activity is performed, and when and where the activity occurs are critical to understanding group processes in greater depth, including supporting goal-oriented applications (e.g., performance, productivity, and mental health) that require sensing social factors. In this work, we propose W4-Groups that captures the functional perspective of variability and repeatability when automatically constructing short-term and long-term groups via multiple data sources (e.g., WiFi and location check-in data). We design and implement W4-Groups to detect and extract all four group features who-what-when-where from the user’s daily mobility patterns. We empirically evaluate the framework using two real-world WiFi datasets and a location check-in dataset, yielding an average of 92% overall accuracy, 96% precision, and 94% recall. Further, we supplement two case studies to demonstrate the application of W4-Groups for next-group activity prediction and analyzing changes in group behavior at a longitudinal scale, exemplifying short-term and long-term occurrences.",

      "abstract": "Technologies increasingly mimic human-like social behaviours. Beyond prototypical conversational agents like chatbots, this also applies to basic automated systems like app notifications or self-checkout machines that address or `talk to' users in everyday situations. Whilst early evidence suggests social cues may enhance user experience, we lack a good understanding of when, and why, their use may be inappropriate. Building on a survey of English-speaking smartphone users (n=80), we conducted experience sampling, interview, and workshop studies (n=11) to elicit people's attitudes and preferences regarding \\textit{how} automated systems talk to them. We thematically analysed examples of phrasings/conduct participants disliked, the reasons they gave, and what they would prefer instead. One category of inappropriate behaviour we identified regards the use of social cues as tools for manipulation. We describe four unwanted tactics interfaces use: agents playing on users' emotions (e.g., guilt-tripping or coaxing them), being pushy, `mothering' users, or being passive-aggressive. Another category regards pragmatics: personal or situational factors that can make a seemingly friendly or helpful utterance come across as rude, tactless, or invasive. These include failing to account for relevant contextual particulars (e.g., embarrassing users in public); expressing obviously false personalised care; or treating a user in ways that they find inappropriate for the system's role or the nature of their relationship. We discuss these behaviours in terms of an emerging `social' class of dark and anti-patterns. Drawing from participant recommendations, we offer suggestions for improving how interfaces treat people in interactions, including broader normative reflections on treating users respectfully.",

      "abstract": "Research has identified applications of mobile-based VR, which utilizes handheld displays or mobile devices, for developing systems that involve users in mixed reality (MR) without the need for head-worn displays (HWDs). Such systems can potentially accommodate large groups of users participating in MR. However, we lack an understanding of how group sizes and interaction methods affect the user experience.}  In this paper, we aim to advance our understanding of mobile-based MR in the context of multiplayer, co-located games. We conducted a study (N = 38) to understand how user experiences vary by group size (2, 4, and 8) and interaction method (proximity-based or pointing-based). For our experiment, we implemented a multiuser experience for up to ten users. We found that proximity-based interaction that encouraged dynamic movement positively affected social presence and physical/temporal workload. In bigger group settings, participants felt less challenged and less positive. Individuals had varying preferences for group size and interaction type. \nThe findings of the study will advance our understanding of the design space for mobile-based MR in terms of group sizes and interaction schemes.\nTo make our contributions explicit, we conclude our paper with design implications that can inform user experience design in mobile-based mixed reality contexts.",

      "abstract": "AI assistance in decision-making has become popular, yet people's inappropriate reliance on AI often leads to unsatisfactory human-AI collaboration performance. In this paper, through three pre-registered, randomized human subject experiments, we explore whether and how the provision of {second opinions} may affect decision-makers' behavior and performance in AI-assisted decision-making. We find that if both the AI model's decision recommendation and a second opinion are always presented together, decision-makers reduce their over-reliance on AI while increase their under-reliance on AI, regardless whether the second opinion is generated by a peer or another AI model. However, if decision-makers have the control to decide when to solicit a peer's second opinion, we find that their active solicitations of second opinions have the potential to mitigate over-reliance on AI without inducing increased under-reliance in some cases. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for promoting effective human-AI collaborations in decision-making.",

      "abstract": "All along their careers, surgeons learn through mentoring, operating on patients side-by-side with expert surgeons. However, access to experts is more and more challenging as they are often located far from learners. Telementoring can increase the reach of mentors by supporting mentoring at a distance, but despite their potential, current systems remain rarely institutionalized. We investigate current surgical mentoring practices, to inform future design of telementoring systems in providing support for learning. In a field study, we observe 11 surgeries and conduct follow-up self-confrontation interviews with mentor-mentee pairs. Through Thematic Analysis, we find that the domain of surgery creates needs for reassuring the mentee regarding safety, sparing them from workload and risk, essential to support the acquisition of skills. Second, mentors understand the situation primarily through the surgical site view but also through inspecting the mentee's posture and the patient's body. Thirdly, mentors take physical distance as their presence limits mentees' autonomy development. We discuss the limits of current surgical telementoring systems and rethink their role as companions of onsite mentoring.",

For instance, when users over-rely on AI assistance, their human-AI team performance is bounded by the model's capability. This work studies how the presentation of model uncertainty may steer users' decision-making toward fostering appropriate reliance. Our results demonstrate that showing the calibrated model confidence alone is inadequate. Rather, calibrating model uncertainty and presenting it in a frequency format allow users to adjust their reliance accordingly and help reduce the effect of confirmation bias on their decisions. Furthermore, the critical nature of our skin cancer screening task skews participants' judgment, causing their reliance to vary depending on their initial decision. Additionally, step-wise multiple regression analyses revealed how user demographics such as age and familiarity with probability and statistics influence human-AI collaborative decision-making. We discuss the potential for model uncertainty presentation, initial user decision, and user demographics to be incorporated in designing personalized AI aids for appropriate reliance.",

To complement previous studies in addressing dark patterns from (1) the designer’s perspective on education and advocacy for ethical designs; and (2) the policymaker’s perspective on new regulations, we propose an end-user-empowerment intervention approach that helps users (1) raise the awareness of dark patterns and understand their underlying design intents; (2) take actions to counter the effects of dark patterns using a web augmentation approach. Through a two-phase co-design study, including 5 co-design workshops (N=12) and a 2-week technology probe study (N=15), we reported findings on the understanding of users' needs, preferences, and challenges in handling dark patterns and investigated the feedback and reactions to users' awareness of and action on dark patterns being empowered in a realistic in-situ setting.",

Trust is a vital factor in the uptake of healthcare services, but the factors affecting trust in voice assistants used for healthcare are under-explored and this specialist domain introduces additional requirements. This study explores the effects of different functional, personal, and risk factors on trust in and adoption of healthcare voice assistants (HVAs), generating a partial least squares structural model from a survey of 300 voice assistant users. Our results indicate that trust in HVAs can be significantly explained by functional factors (usefulness, content credibility, quality of service relative to a healthcare professional), together with security, and privacy risks and personal stance in technology. We also discuss differences in terms of trust between HVAs and general-purpose voice assistants as well as implications that are unique to HVAs.",

Although the general public responded relatively positively, rural pregnant and breastfeeding women showed hesitancy around COVID-19 vaccination, leading to low vaccine uptake. In this work, we started with a formative study to understand pregnant and breastfeeding women's vaccine hesitancy. We found that the main barriers were poor knowledge about vaccines and limited agency around vaccination. To tackle their hesitancy through evidence-based vaccine education, we deployed a  chatbot over WhatsApp. We studied the chatbot engagement of 800+ participants over 23 days through chat logs, surveys, and interviews. We present participants' experiences and aspirations around chatbots. We found the chatbot to work well under a constrained network to build participants' vaccine-related knowledge and intention. We further discuss the role of chatbots in healthcare beyond COVID-19 vaccination.",

Research on neurodivergent children’s interactions with voice agents has largely focused on therapy and classroom contexts as opposed to home contexts. We conducted a remote case study via Zoom observing six families with neurodivergent children playing with a tangible, parent-operated voice agent at home for up to eight weeks. We used quantitative measures of agent utilization, qualitative analysis of video recordings, and parent survey responses to identify implications for teleoperation interface design for playful voice agents. Based on our analysis, we argue joint media engagement principles are applicable to a broader set of play activities, and teleoperated agents present affordances and challenges distinct from those of automated agents.",

We interviewed 11 youth kidney transplant patients and 12 caregivers to elicit their transplant journey experiences. We found that probing participants about specific parts of their transplant journey gave them structure to tell us rich stories about their experiences. Based on our findings, we discuss informing the design of a tool to support the capturing of stories for youth with chronic illnesses. Designing such tool could help youth and their caregivers to identify barriers, support reflection, and promote self-efficacy. Youth with chronic illnesses already have to change so many aspects of their lives to accommodate their illness, however, by giving them a platform to capture their chronic illness journey, it could encourage them to take more control of their lives and better collaborate with others.",

      "abstract": "On online platforms, algorithms help us build and manage our relationships. However, their invisible inter- ventions might also pose harm to these connections. Dating platforms offer a prime example where, despite extensive research on human-inflicted harm, the potential harm from the algorithms themselves, and user strategies for mitigating them, remains largely unexplored. In our analysis of 7,043 reviews and interviews with 30 Tinder users, we unveiled how users perceive algorithmic harm as damaging self-esteem, sabotaging potential relationships, encouraging antisocial behavior, and misrepresenting or marginalizing certain identi- ties. We introduce a new algorithmic folk theory, the \"conflict of interest\" theory, perceived to perpetuate these harms. This theory encapsulates users’ sense of a contradiction between the dating platform’s promise of finding the perfect partner (leading to discontinued use of Tinder) and its commercial interest in retaining users to increase revenue. Users suspected various algorithmic processes pursuant to this theory, such as (a) throttling profile visibility, (b) manipulating users’ matches, and (c) recommending large quantities of profiles that will not lead to matches. They also described various strategies in resistance or defense of these suspected algorithmic processes, such as engaging in counter-intuitive behaviour to disrupt the unfavorable algorithmic processes or leveraging location based filtering for match variety and safety. We conclude by discussing how the perceived algorithmic harms can inform the development of new algorithmic implementations that balance both user and company interests.",

This paper presents a pre-registered, controlled experiment showing that ML practitioners (N=119) spent 5x less time on task, and were 17% less accurate about the data and model, when given access to interpretability tools. We present bounded rationality as the theoretical reason behind these findings. Bounded rationality presumes human departures from perfect rationality, and it is often effectuated by satisficing, i.e., an inclination towards \"good enough\" understanding. Adding interactive elements—a strategy often employed to promote deliberative thinking and engagement, and tested in our experiment—also does not help. We discuss implications for interpretability designers and researchers related to how cognitive and contextual factors can affect the effectiveness of interpretability tool use.",

However, these methods fail to capture the complexity and nuances in citizen's needs, i.e., citizens are generally unaware of other's needs, perspectives, and experiences. Consequently, policies developed with this underlying gap tend to overlook the alignment of multistakeholder perspectives, and design policies based on the optimization of high-level demographic features. In our contribution, we propose a method to enable citizens understand other's perspectives and calibrate their positions. First, we collected requirements and design principles to develop our approach by involving stakeholders and experts in policymaking in a series of workshops. Then, we conducted a crowdsourcing study with 420 participants to compare the effect of different text and images, on people’s initial and final motivations and their willingness to change opinions. We observed that both influence participant's opinion change, however, the effect is more pronounced for textual modality. Finally, we discuss overarching implications of designing with empathy to mediate alignment of citizen's perspectives.",

      "abstract": "Emotion AI, or AI that attempts to infer emotional states from various data sources, is increasingly deployed in myriad contexts, including mental healthcare. While emotion AI is celebrated for its potential to improve care and diagnosis, we know little about the perceptions of data subjects most directly impacted by its integration into mental healthcare. In this paper, we qualitatively analyzed U.S. adults’ open-ended survey responses (N =395) to examine their perceptions of emotion AI use in mental healthcare and its potential impacts on them as data subjects. We found various perceived impacts of emotion AI use in mental healthcare concerning 1) mental healthcare provisions, 2) data subjects’ voices, 3) monitoring data subjects for potential harm, and 4) involved parties’ understandings and uses of mental health inferences. Participants’ remarks highlight ways emotion AI could address existing challenges data subjects may face by 1) improving mental healthcare assessments, diagnoses, and treatments; 2) facilitating data subjects’ mental health information disclosures; 3) identifying potential data subject self-harm or harm posed to others; and 4) increasing involved parties’ understanding of mental health. However, participants also described their perceptions of potential negative impacts of emotion AI use on data subjects such as 1) increasing inaccurate and biased assessments, diagnoses, and treatments; 2) reducing or removing data subjects’ voices and interactions with providers in mental healthcare processes; 3) inaccurately identifying potential data subject self-harm or harm posed to others with negative implications for wellbeing; and 4) involved parties misusing emotion AI inferences with consequences to (quality) mental healthcare access and data subjects’ privacy. We discuss how our findings suggest that emotion AI use in mental healthcare is an insufficient “techno-solution” that may exacerbate various mental healthcare challenges with implications for potential distributive, procedural, and interactional injustices and potentially disparate impacts on marginalized groups.",

      "abstract": "Patent applications provide insight into how inventors imagine and legitimize uses of their imagined technologies; as part of this imagining they envision social worlds and produce sociotechnical imaginaries. Examining sociotechnical imaginaries is important for emerging technologies in high-stakes contexts such as the case of emotion AI to address mental health care. We analyzed emotion AI patent applications (N=58) filed in the U.S. concerned with monitoring and detecting emotions and/or mental health. We examined the described technologies’ imagined uses and the problems they were positioned to address. We found that inventors justified emotion AI inventions as solutions to issues surrounding data accuracy, care provision and experience, patient-provider communication, emotion regulation, and preventing harms attributed to mental health causes. We then applied an ethical speculation lens to anticipate the potential implications of the promissory emotion AI-enabled futures described in patent applications. We argue that such a future is one filled with mental health conditions' (or ‘non-expected’ emotions') stigmatization, equating mental health with propensity for crime, and lack of data subjects' agency. By framing individuals with mental health conditions as unpredictable and not capable of exercising their own agency, emotion AI mental health patent applications propose solutions that intervene in this imagined future: intensive surveillance, an emphasis on individual responsibility over structural barriers, and decontextualized behavioral change interventions. Using ethical speculation, we articulate the consequences of these discourses, raising questions about the role of emotion AI as positive, inherent, or inevitable in health and care-related contexts. We discuss our findings’ implications for patent review processes, and advocate for policy makers, researchers and technologists to refer to patent (applications) to access, evaluate and (re)consider potentially harmful sociotechnical imaginaries before they become our reality.",

      "abstract": "Chatbots are increasingly being used in mental healthcare – e.g., for assessing mental-health conditions and providing digital counseling – and have been found to have considerable potential for facilitating people’s behavioral changes. Nevertheless, little research has examined how specific chatbot designs may help reduce public stigmatization of mental illness. To help fill that gap, this study explores how stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illness may be affected by conversations with chatbots that have 1) varying ways of expressing their interpretations of participants’ statements and 2) different styles of self-disclosure. More specifically, we implemented and tested four chatbot designs that varied in terms of whether they interpreted participants’ comments as stigmatizing or non-stigmatizing, and whether they provided stigmatizing, non-stigmatizing, or no self-disclosure of chatbot's own views. Over the two-week period of the experiment, all four chatbots’ conversations with our participants centered on seven mental-illness vignettes, all featuring the same character. We found that the chatbot featuring non-stigmatizing interpretations and non-stigmatizing self-disclosure performed best at reducing the participants’ stigmatizing attitudes, while the one that provided stigmatizing interpretations and stigmatizing self-disclosures had the least beneficial effect. We also discovered side effects of chatbot’s self-disclosure: notably, that chatbots were perceived to have inflexible and strong opinions, which undermined their credibility. As such, this paper contributes to knowledge about how chatbot designs shape users’ perceptions of the chatbots themselves, and how chatbots’ interpretation and self-disclosure may be leveraged to help reduce mental-illness stigma.",

In particular, we call attention to the presumption of total countability observed in annotation—the notion that everything, from tasks, datasets and deliverables, to workers, work time, quality and performance, can be managed by applying the logics of counting. To examine this, we draw on sociological and socio-technical scholarship on quantification and develop the lens of a ‘regime of counting’ that makes explicit the specific counts, practices, actors and structures that underpin the pervasive counting in annotation. We find that within the AI supply chain and data work, counting regimes aid the assertion of authority by the AI clients (also called requesters) over annotation processes, constituting them as reductive, standardised, and homogenous. We illustrate how this has implications for i) how annotation work and workers get valued, ii) the role human discretion plays in annotation, and iii) broader efforts to introduce accountable and more just practices in AI. Through these implications, we illustrate the limits of operating within the logic of total countability. Instead, we argue for a view of counting as partial—located in distinct geographies, shaped by specific interests and accountable in only limited ways. This, we propose, sets the stage for a fundamentally different orientation to counting and what counts in data annotation.",

We investigate this question using data about the use of privacy-enhancing technologies and strategies from 128 surveys and 17 follow-up interviews with two populations: privacy experts (i.e., privacy researchers and professionals) and privacy laypersons. Findings reveal that both experts and laypersons use common privacy strategies, but experts employ a broader range of strategies, favor open source technologies, and possess a more technical understanding of internet privacy risks and technologies such as onion routing and tracking algorithms. We characterize these differences in terms of sociological habitus, where experts and laypersons differ not only in technical skill but also in broader conceptualizations and practices. From this characterization, we make recommendations for technology design practices, as well as legal and pedagogical implications, that can help decenter the experiences of privacy experts and accommodate privacy laypersons' preferences and habits.",

However, these platforms were each designed to only facilitate a single archetype of community engagement, limiting their capacity for adaptation when contextual or stakeholder requirements change. This paper builds upon these projects to introduce a design vocabulary, grounded in a formal ontology describing the core components necessary to run adaptable, structured engagements through synchronous group telephony. Through a series of scenarios, we present how this design vocabulary can be used to: help design and communicate different models of synchronous audio engagements, describe existing technologies, and highlight other novel ways in which such platforms could be used. We discuss how while under-explored to this point, synchronous telephony platforms can be designed to orchestrate stakeholder engagements with a degree of flexibility previously impossible in remote, offline contexts.",

      "abstract": "Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) integrate data from a variety of sources, including sensors, for the purpose of enabling farmers to interpret past activity and predict future performance. FMIS is traditionally designed for and used by large farms, given their capital and need for automation and to scale up. This paper examines the current data collection practices on small and medium farms so that FMIS systems can be better designed to their needs. Our empirical research comprises interviews conducted during 10 farm visits. Our semi-structured interviews incorporated questions about daily activities, points of decision-making, data sharing, and incentives for data collection. We analyzed the interviews by focusing on possible obstacles to adopting expanding digital data collection practices and how expanded data collection might help fulfill farmers' goals and motivations. We found that farmers use their own bespoke data collection techniques instead of or in parallel to more formalized methods and often hold key observations and hypotheses in their heads rather than committing them to any data collection system at all. Key barriers to FMIS adoption include technology skepticism, technical hurdles and lack of support, and self-doubt in technical skills. Based on this empirical work and analysis, we recommend that FMIS systems can best address the needs of small and medium farms by: 1) accounting for the farmers' different approaches to memorizing vs. storing data, 2) integrating rather than trying to replace existing practices, and 3) considering the economic and political motivations driving farm decision-making and practices.",

In this study, we present a qualitative analysis of letters posted on the r/SuicideBereavement subreddit, and comments replying to those posts, to explore what diverse expressions of grief additionally demand of platform design.  \n\nWe find that letter posts contain potentially harmful grief expressions that, in this community, generate mutual support among community members. Informed by our findings, this study considers the design challenges for online platforms as they simultaneously support users receiving support and healing through sharing certain grief expressions, while also supporting users who will be harmed by exposure to those grief expressions.

We explore participatory data stewardship in the context of clinical computer security for survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV). Via semi-structured interviews with IPV support workers, we explore how data are produced within the IPV care ecosystem at the Clinic to End Tech Abuse (CETA). We then conduct design provocations with clients of IPV services and their support workers, exploring possibilities for participatory data mechanisms like open records and dynamic consent. We find participation in data stewardship may benefit clients through improved agency, self-reflection, and control of self-narrative, and that incurred burdens may be alleviated by enlisting trusted stewards. We close with future work for CSCW interrogating how knowledge of digital-safety harms can and should be produced from clinical encounters, towards more equitable ways of knowing.",

While early research suggests that focusing volunteer work in this way using microtasking may be fruitful, the effects of microtasking on contributor behavior in volunteer peer production settings like OpenStreetMap remain unclear. This paper takes advantage of a natural experiment facilitated by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap's Tasking Manager microtasking system and employs causal inference analysis to evaluate the effects of a microtasking intervention on contributor dynamics. Our study employs a systematic approach and leverages an extensive and diverse dataset to analyze peer production dynamics, expanding on prior research and seeking to address knowledge gaps in the understanding of peer production and interface design of the microtasking system. We causally show that, indeed, microtasking can be an effective intervention in peer production settings. However, it may exacerbate power-law patterns that are common in peer production settings. By incorporating project design decisions and characteristics, we further suggest implications for platform practitioners, with a focus on addressing engagement and contribution inequity issues prevalent in settings like OpenStreetMap.",

We investigated whether personal values systematically influence the behaviors of individuals who use the Zooniverse platform to select and contribute to citizen science projects. In this paper, we present the results of a research study where we launched a large-scale survey (N = 2,605) to capture personal values using Schwartz's Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-21). We also extracted system log data from participant interactions on Zooniverse. Our results align with previous research suggesting intrinsic type motivators and values tend to drive specific modes of interaction, e.g., exploring projects in different disciplines. We also see that interaction in social spaces, e.g., discussion boards, is driven by values with a personal focus (e.g., self-enhancement) and social focus. Given these results, we provide several suggestions for managing these and similar projects.",

      "abstract": "Delivery robots are increasingly becoming part of our urban landscape. However, the general public is divided about their presence in public spaces; some welcome their usefulness, while others see them as intrusive or even threatening. Our study aims to understand users' perceptions of these robots to provide concrete insights into their further development. First, we used text mining to analyze people's reactions to popular YouTube videos featuring delivery robots. Based on these findings, we applied the scenario-based design method to develop scenarios illustrating user interactions with delivery robots. We then conducted in-depth interviews with 30 participants to explore their views on these scenarios. Our analysis highlighted several design issues, including robots' aesthetics, interactions with pedestrians, and the broader physical and regulatory framework. We also identified common concerns and positive expectations about these robots. From these findings, we propose design implications for the future of delivery robots.",

      "abstract": "In highly developed countries where smartphones are both accessible and expected, why are some individuals still choosing to use dumbphones? Dumbphones, as an anachronistic (or, outdated) technology are an unusual choice when many government systems, business services, and interpersonal relationships, make use of the diverse communication methods presented by smartphones. However, they are increasingly (re)adopted by individuals seeking, among other motivations, a low-distraction digital handset. Further, we investigate the phenomenon of designer dumbphones, or newly developed dumbphones redesigned to meet the needs of dumbphone users in the contemporary technological and infrastructural era. We report on the results of interviews with eight users of traditional dumbphones, five users of designer dumbphones, and two developers of designer dumbphones. Our findings identify not only the impact of the digital disconnection movement, but dumbphones as tools for mental and physical health, practicing religious devotion, and enacting political disaffiliation. Our analysis takes into account experiences of isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the kinds of privilege needed to choose digital disconnection, along with the interpersonal complications that result from doing so. This work contributes to conversations around volitional technical (non)use and disputes the notion that increased communication leads to richer interpersonal interaction. As dumbphone (re)adoption becomes an increasing trend in popular media, our goal is to uncover potential sites of digital disconnection and understand how different groups of individuals might experience those sites.",

      "abstract": "People often apply gender stereotypes toward computerized agents. Rather than challenging these stereotypes, modern AI technologies controversially use them in creating AI agents that underline stereotypical gendered roles. This approach thus further reinforces the often male-dominated societal gender norms and disenfranchises women and gender non-binary individuals. While this issue has raised concerns in the HCI and CSCW communities, still little is known regarding how to mitigate the negative impacts of embedding gender stereotypes in AI agents. In this paper, we propose an eXplainable AI (XAI) approach to mitigate individuals’ gender stereotypes toward AI agents. We conducted an online video vignette experiment with 350 participants randomly assigned to one of the eighteen conditions of a 3 (gender of the agent: woman, man, gender-neutral) x 3 (task gender: feminine, masculine, neutral) x 2 (presence or absence of AI explanation) between-subjects design. Our findings indeed suggest that XAI helped participants avoid applying gender stereotypes toward gendered AI agents, by increasing their understanding of how the agent came to its decision and decreasing their rating of the agent's humanlikeness. We contribute to CSCW research by providing a timely investigation into individuals' gender stereotypes toward the state-of-the-art AI agents and by advancing the empirical understanding of the cognitive processes and mechanisms underlying these gender stereotypes. We also demonstrate how eXplainable AI can effectively suppress the application of social characteristics (i.e., gender stereotypes) toward AI agents by disrupting the said cognitive processes. Insights from this study can inform how future AI technologies should be designed to create a progressive gender reality that will gradually reshape humans' experience and ingrained gender ideologies.",

Many of these users are new to online information environments and are highly susceptible to misinformation. Fact-checking has the potential to reduce the proliferation and impact of misinformation; however, little is known about how fact-checking organizations in India serve rural users. To fill this gap, we conducted interviews with 12 prominent fact-checking organizations in India to understand their current practices and challenges in providing their services to rural users and the associated human and technological infrastructure they use. We discovered several measures that fact-checking organizations take to increase the reach, awareness, and relevance of fact-checked content for rural users, such as engaging with stringer networks and utilizing vernacular languages. However, fact-checking organizations also face severe challenges that limit both the scale of their work and engagement from rural users. Drawing on these findings, we provide design and policy recommendations to improve the reach, awareness, and relevance of fact-checked content for social media users in rural areas.",

      "abstract": "Attending to emotion can shed light on why recognizing an ethical issue and taking responsibility for it can be so demanding. To examine emotions related to taking or not taking responsibility for ethical action, we conducted a semi-structured interview study with 23 individuals working in interaction design and developing AI systems in Scandinavian countries. Through a thematic analysis of how participants attribute ethical responsibility, we identify three ethical stances, that is, discursive approaches to answering the question ‘who should act’: an individualized I-stance (“the responsibility is mine”), a collective we-stance (“the responsibility is ours”), and a distanced they-stance (“the responsibility is someone else’s”). Further, we introduce the concepts of distancing and vulnerability to analyze the emotion work that these three ethical stances place on technology practitioners in situations of low- and high-scale technology development, where they have more or less control over the outcomes of their work. We show how the we- and they-stances let technology practitioners distance themselves from the results of their activity, while the I-stance makes them more vulnerable to emotional and material risks. By illustrating the emotional dimensions involved in recognizing ethical issues and embracing responsibility, our study contributes to the field of Ethics in Practice. We argue that emotions play a pivotal role in technology practitioners’ decision-making process, influencing their choices to either take action or refrain from doing so.",

Such content typically aims to marginalize and disempower Muslims and sow animosity between them and non-Muslims. Yet, there has not been an investigation of the impact of the spread of such targeted misinformation on the online practices of Muslims. Through semi-structured interviews with 19 Muslim participants from diverse backgrounds, we sought to understand how Muslims in the United States navigate and use the very online spaces that are leveraged to spread misinformation targeted at them. Our findings provide a nuanced understanding of how targeted misinformation subjects Muslims to misperceptions from non-Muslims and has the harmful effect of leaving Muslims exhausted and disempowered by the futility of their attempts to correct the misperceptions. We further identify forces that drive Muslims to act or retreat in their online practices in response to being targeted by misinformation. These insights can prove useful to industry, civil society organizations, and policymakers in order to curb injustices related to Islamic misinformation.",

Social computing technologies are increasingly being used to counter misinformation, but more work is needed to understand how they can support the work of community-based trusted messengers. We describe an early exploration of these opportunities in our collaboration with Black and Latinx young adult “Peer Champions” addressing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a southern U.S. state. We conducted interviews engaging them with a social media monitoring and outreach dashboard we designed, using it to probe their understanding of their roles and current and potential use of digital platforms. With the concept of cultural code-switching as a framing, we found that the Peer Champions leveraged their particular combination of cultural, health, and digital literacy skills to understand their communities’ concerns surrounding misinformation and to communicate health information in a culturally appropriate manner. While their positioning between their communities and public health research and practice motivated and enabled their work, it also introduced challenges in finding (mis)information online and navigating tensions around authenticity and respect in engaging those close to them. Our research contributes towards characterizing the valuable and difficult work trusted messengers do, and (re)imagining collaboratively designed interpretive digital tools to support them.",

      "abstract": "Designers widely accept AI as a partner in the design process for its efficient and intelligent decision-making. However, AI is often not perfect, and AI error often makes humans dumbfounded. Literature has pointed out the value of such AI error, while still leaving its inspiration essence and application strategies uncharted from the practice perspective. This work focuses on bridging the practice gap by looking into and exploiting the imaginative ``mislabeled'' objects of object detection models. To gain insights into the inspiration of AI ``error'', we collected a dedicated AI ``error'' dataset from object detection and invited 8 designers to share divergent comments on the ``mislabeled'' objects. Coding was then performed on the comments, which summarizes the inspiration of AI ``error'' into six atomic dimensions. Subsequently, we took a step further to an exploratory study, a comparative ideation experiment with 20 designers, investigating how to apply these inspiration dimensions to create ideas. Questionnaire and interview results revealed that essential inspiration of AI ``error'' could positively activate creativity, especially the ``Outline'' dimension. A design model CETR is then formulated by summarizing the application of atomic inspiration of ``error'' into four forms of creativity, which could be taken as a guideline for cooperative design with AI ``error''. In addition, we also sketch two approaches to generate more inspiring and applicable AI ``error'', elaborate on two principal characteristics of AI ``error'' for promoting creativity, and propose three strategies for better co-creating with AI ``error''. Finally, we provide insight into design research about AI self-awareness and human-AI collaboration.",

      "abstract": "Creative ML tools are collaborative systems that afford artistic creativity through their myriad interactive relationships. We propose using ``assemblage thinking\" to support analyses of creative ML by approaching it as a system in which the elements of people, organizations, culture, practices, and technology constantly influence each other. We model these interactions as ``coordinating elements\" that give rise to the social and political characteristics of a particular creative ML context, and call attention to three dynamic elements of creative ML whose interactions provide unique context for the social impact a particular system as: people, creative processes, and products. As creative assemblages are highly contextual, we present these as analytical concepts that computing researchers can adapt to better understand the functioning of a particular system or phenomena and identify intervention points to foster desired change. This paper contributes to theorizing interactions with AI in the context of art, and how these interactions shape the production of algorithmic art.",

      "abstract": "Prewriting is the process of discovering and developing ideas before writing a first draft, which requires divergent thinking and often implies unstructured strategies such as diagramming, outlining, free-writing, etc. Although large language models (LLMs) have been demonstrated to be useful for a variety of tasks including creative writing, little is known about how users would collaborate with LLMs to support prewriting. The preferred collaborative role and initiative of LLMs during such a creative process is also unclear. To investigate human-LLM collaboration patterns and dynamics during prewriting, we conducted a three-session qualitative study with 15 participants in two creative tasks: story writing and slogan writing. The findings indicated that during collaborative prewriting, there appears to be a three-stage iterative Human-AI Co-creativity process that includes Ideation, Illumination, and Implementation stages. This collaborative process champions the human in a dominant role, in addition to mixed and shifting levels of initiative that exist between humans and LLMs. This research also reports on collaboration breakdowns that occur during this process, user perceptions of using existing LLMs during Human-AI Co-creativity, and discusses design implications to support this co-creativity process.",

This study investigates how local online groups are perceived relative to more traditional local news outlets, and compares the community benefits provided by each. Based on prior theoretical contributions, we developed a framework for measuring the benefits of local information presence on individual-level pro-community attitudes. In our experiment N=170, we asked frequent Facebook users living in four U.S. cities to start following local news pages or local online groups on Facebook for one month, and compared their perceptions of quality and changes in pro-community attitudes. We find that posts from local news pages are perceived to be of significantly higher quality than posts from local online groups. However, neither following new local news pages or local groups led to significant changes in pro-community attitudes during our study period. We discuss implications for the future study of local news in a changing media ecology.",

      "abstract": "Hero drafting for multiplayer online arena (MOBA) games is crucial because drafting directly affects the outcome of a match. Both sides take turns to \"ban\"/\"pick\" a hero from a roster of approximately 100 heroes to assemble their drafting. In professional tournaments, the process becomes more complex as teams are not allowed to pick heroes used in the previous rounds with the \"best-of-N\" rule. Additionally, human factors including the team's familiarity with drafting and play styles are overlooked by previous studies. Meanwhile, the huge impact of patch iteration on drafting strengths in the professional tournament is of concern. To this end, we propose a visual analytics system, BPCoach, to facilitate hero drafting planning by comparing various drafting through recommendations and predictions and distilling relevant human and in-game factors. Two case studies, expert feedback, and a user study suggest that BPCoach helps determine hero drafting in a rounded and efficient manner.",

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of VTuber creators and viewers across the globe. This practise has drawn research attention into topics such as viewers' engagement behaviors and perceptions, however, as animated avatars offer more identity and performance flexibility than traditional live streaming where one uses their own body, little research has focused on how this flexibility influences how creators present themselves. This research thus seeks to fill this gap by presenting results from a qualitative study of 16 Chinese-speaking VTubers' streaming practices. The data revealed that the virtual avatars that were used while live streaming afforded creators opportunities to present themselves using inflated presentations and resulted in inclusive interactions with viewers. The results also unveiled the inflated, and often sexualized, gender expressions of VTubers while they were situated in misogynistic environments. The socio-technical facets of VTubing were found to potentially reduce sexual harassment and sexism, whilst also raising self-objectification concerns.",

Existing work has primarily focused on understanding and supporting the technology use of pregnant people, neglecting other stakeholders' needs and participation. We therefore consider how pregnancy tracking apps both improve and interfere with the reconfiguration of social relationships caused by pregnancy, drawing on insights from family sociology to examine how these relationships evolve over pregnancy and the transition to parenthood. We reviewed the features of 20 pregnancy tracking apps, and analyzed 4,709 public reviews of them, finding that stakeholders used apps to bond with one another around the excitement of pregnancy, build a prenatal relationship with the fetus, and co-manage pregnancy-related logistical tasks. We find that not accounting fetal demographics and users' identities, along with socio-cultural norms around gender and parenting roles, often inhibit these collaborative practices. We therefore suggest designing collaborative pregnancy tracking technology that considers both inclusiveness and specificity regarding stakeholders' different roles and relationships to pregnancy.",

At the same time, these disclosures can lead to harassment and stigmatization. Evidence suggests that today's social platforms provide many more options and opportunities for sensitive disclosure than are possible offline, but we lack a taxonomy of disclosure strategies. Drawing on Goffman's self-presentation framework, we examined two types of sensitive disclosure within the cisgender male adolescent gay, bisexual, and/or queer (GBQ) population: revealing one’s GBQ identity on social media and revealing the use of an anti-HIV medication, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), on both social media and dating apps. We find that today’s online environment, with its different affordances, provides new opportunities for disclosure, such as the use of associations, repeated over time. Participants had distinct ideas about what disclosures were normative and relevant to particular social platforms and audiences. Lastly, we discuss suggestions for how platform design might promote sensitive disclosure.",

Though it enables seeing others’ facial expressions, the visual feedback can instead lead to unexpected self-focus, resulting in users missing cues for others to engage in the conversation equally. To support expressive communication and equal participation among unacquainted counterparts, we propose SealMates, a behavior-driven avatar in which the avatar infers the engagement level of the group based on collective gaze and speech patterns and then moves across interlocutors' windows in the video conferencing. By conducting a controlled experiment with 15 groups of triads, we found the avatar's movement encouraged people to experience more self-disclosure and made them perceive everyone was equally engaged in the conversation than when there was no behavior-driven avatar. We discuss how a behavior-driven avatar influences distributed members' perceptions and the implications of avatar-mediated communication for future platforms.",

      "abstract": "The global COVID-19 pandemic has motivated new collaborations across borders and boundaries, while also emphasizing the importance of supporting the continued wellbeing of hybrid, remote, and in-person workers. Work in CSCW and HCI has demonstrated that identity, culture, and organizational factors all have a strong influence on how people come to understand wellbeing. However, more work is needed to understand how to support workplace wellbeing for location-independent teams, particularly given the importance of these diverse factors. In this study, we ask the question: how did organizational, cultural, and individual factors influence how workers understood their workplace wellbeing needs during the move to remote work? We take a look at the broader human infrastructure supporting hybrid and remote work, including both workers who engage in technology-mediated labor, and the essential workers who support it. Through linguistic analyses of 13,265 diary entries collected throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and in-depth interviews with 26 employees from around the world, we find substantial diversity in wellbeing needs and conceptualizations. We build on these findings to provide recommendations for how technology design can better support new and diverse forms of worker wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Data-driven predictions are often perceived as inaccurate in hindsight due to behavioral responses~\\cite{perdomo2020performative}. We consider the role of interface design choices on how individuals respond to predictions presented on a shared information display in a strategic setting. We introduce a novel staged experimental design to investigate the effects of interface design features, such as the visualization of prediction uncertainty and prediction error, within a repeated congestion game. In this game, participants assume the role of taxi drivers and use a shared information display to decide where to search for their next ride. Our experimental design endows agents with varying level-$k$ depths of thinking~\\cite{camerer2004cognitive}, allowing some agents to possess greater sophistication in anticipating the decisions of others using the same information display. Through several large pre-registered experiments, we identify trade-offs between displays that are optimal for individual decisions and those that best serve the collective social welfare of the system. Additionally, we note that the influence of display characteristics varies based on an agent's strategic sophistication. We observe that design choices promoting individual-level decision-making can lead to suboptimal system outcomes, as manifested by a lower realization of potential social welfare. However, this decline in social welfare is offset by a slight reduction in distribution shift, narrowing the gap between predicted and realized system outcomes. This may enhance the perceived reliability and trustworthiness of the information display post hoc. Our findings pave the way for new research questions concerning the design of effective prediction interfaces in strategic environments.",

In this study, we first offer a comparative analysis of seven research projects on how 152 abusive partners (APs) of IPV talk about, and make sense of, their malicious uses of technology in-person. To ground our discoveries in immediate practical benefit for practitioner communities, we first introduce the challenges reported by 20 APIP facilitators to investigate potential avenues to address technology abuse in their programming. While expressing a keen interest to address technology abuse in their work, professionals expressed concern over a lack of information, risky attempts to establish ground truth, a fear of teaching APs new abusive techniques, and a lack of appropriate approaches to de-normalizing problematic technology use. Paired with this information, our analysis of AP accounts highlight three important factors that are most often obscured from general descriptions of tech abuse; namely, awareness, justifications, and strategies for desistance. We conclude with targeted, practical steps forward for the wider CSCW community and for professional stakeholders in violence prevention work.",

As these assistants continue to be adopted for everyday uses, it is imperative to understand how the portrayed gender shapes the voice assistant's ability to mitigate errors, which are still common in voice interactions. We report a study (N=40) that examined the effects of voice gender (feminine, ambiguous, masculine), error mitigation strategies (apology, compensation) and participant's gender on people's interaction behavior and perceptions of the assistant. Our results show that AI assistants that apologized appeared warmer than those offered compensation. Moreover, male participants preferred apologetic feminine assistants over apologetic masculine ones. Furthermore, male participants interrupted AI assistants regardless of perceived gender more frequently than female participants when errors occurred. Our results suggest that the perceived gender of a voice assistant biases user behavior, especially for male users, and that an ambiguous voice has the potential to reduce biases associated with gender-specific traits.",

Despite these efforts, youth unemployment in various regions is attributed to the complex challenges that impede access to resources, particularly in contexts characterized by socio-political unrest. To understand the use of job-seeking resources in such a context, we situate our work in the region of Jammu \\& Kashmir, which has a long-standing history of socio-political conflict ongoing for more than three decades. For this work, we conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with participants from Kashmir to understand their current job-seeking practices and the challenges they encounter during the entire process. Our findings present the systemic infrastructural challenges the youths face due to the ongoing crisis. Analyzing the youths' workarounds to mitigate these challenges, we discuss how we might leverage these workarounds into designing systems while navigating through the contextual complexities. We discuss the challenges of designing in the context and provide design recommendations to support job seekers.",

While psychological counseling has been a traditional solution, it faces such barriers as negative societal perceptions and limited accessibility. To overcome these, researchers have explored remote counseling via video/voice calls. Despite its advantages of accessibility, convenience, and anonymity, the lack of personal interaction continues to be a drawback. This study investigates the feasibility of using an augmented reality (AR) mask in remote counseling and whether it could increase the level of self-disclosure—which is often used to measure the effectiveness of counseling—while maintaining anonymity. We conducted a controlled experiment and a qualitative user study to assess the effects of AR masks on counselees’ level of self-disclosure during remote counseling. The results suggest that AR masks can increase this level more effectively for people with a low disposition for self-disclosure.",

Beyond traditional audience participation mechanisms, such as chat messages or commands, these livestreams allow viewers to join, socially interact, and participate through avatars in a software-driven virtual scenario without requiring the presence of a human streamer. From observations of livestreaming sessions and interviews with regular users (n=23), we define the main features of this novel form of livestreaming and we analyze what makes it engaging for participants, as well as factors that limit the user experience. The use of avatars affords a strong sense of presence and participation, and together with the absence of a streamer, it shapes new forms of sociability, being together, and belonging. Challenges include repetitive content and overcrowding. We provide design implications for synchronous collective participation scenarios and opportunities for software-driven content generation.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we describe and reflect upon the development of critical consciousness and workplace democracy within an experimental workplace called DataWorks. Through DataWorks, we hire adults from communities historically minoritized in computing education and data careers, and train them in entry-level data skills developed through work on client projects. In this process, workers gain a range of skills. Some of these skills are technical, such as programming for data analysis; some are managerial, such as scoping and bidding projects; others are social, perhaps even political, such as the ability to say “No” to projects. In this paper, we describe a workshop series developed to build the workers’ critical literacy and consciousness about their data work, specifically regarding the use of data in machine learning and artificial intelligence systems. After that, we describe a data project the workers questioned and resisted because they determined the work to be harmful. In that process, they demonstrated and enacted a critical consciousness towards data and machine learning. Reflecting on this enactment of data-focused critical consciousness, we identify themes that characterize a democratic workplace, describe the work of designing for organizational action and institutional relations, and discuss how worker and researcher positionality affects this work. In doing so, we argue for enabling workers to resist and refuse harmful data work and challenge the standard power structures of academic research and data work.",

      "abstract": "In the mental health domain, where AI technologies will impact their treatment and daily lives, patient engagement can be a key to designing human-centered technologies. CSCW and HCI researchers have delved into various facets of collaboration in AI research; however, previous research neglects the individuals who produce the data and who will be impacted by the resulting technologies, such as patients. This study examines how interdisciplinary researchers and mental health patients who donate their data for AI research collaborate and how we can improve human-centeredness in mental health AI research. We interviewed patient participants, AI researchers, and clinical researchers in a federally funded mental health AI research project. We used the concept of boundary objects to understand stakeholder collaboration. Our findings reveal that the social media data provided by patient participants functioned as boundary objects that facilitated stakeholder collaboration. Although the collaboration appeared to be successful, we argue that building consensus, or understanding each other's perspectives, can improve the human-centeredness of mental health AI research. Based on the findings, we provide suggestions for human-centered mental health AI research, working with data donors as domain experts, making invisible work visible, and privacy implications.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language models (LLMs) show the potential to significantly augment or even replace complex human writing activities. However, in a complex writing task where people need to make decisions as well as a justification, it is not clear whether the LLMs can make the writing tasks faster or hinder users’ agency. In this paper, we explored the trade-offs of providing intelligent support for writing meta-review as part of the academic peer review process. We prototype a system “MetaWriter” trained on 5 years of open peer review data to support meta-reviewing: The system highlights common topics in the original peer reviews, extracts key points by each reviewer, and on request provides a preliminary draft of a meta-review that can be further edited. To understand whether and to what extent meta-reviewers both experienced and less experienced see value in writing support for this task, we conducted a within-subject study with 32\nparticipants. Each participant wrote meta-reviewers for two papers: one with and one without MetaWriter. We found that MetaWriter significantly expedited the meta-review authoring process and improved the coverage, as rated by experts, compared to the baseline In a within-subjects experiment, 32 participants wrote meta-reviews using MetaWriter and a baseline environment with no machine support. We found that\nMetaWriter significantly expedited the meta-review authoring process and improved the coverage, as rated by experts, compared to the baseline. While participants recognized the efficiency benefits, they raised issues and concerns around trust, over-reliance, and agency. We also interviewed six paper authors to understand their opinions of using machine intelligence to support the peer review process and reported critical reflections. We discuss implications for future interactive AI writing tools to support complex synthesis work.",

However, there is a limited understanding of the impact of digitization on home phlebotomists' workflows. To address this gap, we conducted 26 semi-structured interviews with home phlebotomists, riders, and patients, supplemented by observations of the entire workday of 3 phlebotomists. We found that home phlebotomists' technology-mediated workflows are organized in ways that enable them to build strong support networks of human infrastructure, helping them negotiate and optimize their daily workflows. Moreover, while the digitization of their workflows resulted in continued surveillance, it empowered them to justify their decisions and present evidence of work when needed. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for equitable platform work and the future of platformized health and conclude with design recommendations for telehealth platforms offering home phlebotomy services.",

      "abstract": "The secondary use of routinely collected patient data made possible by the broad consent form is seen as a prerequisite for developing data-driven health technologies. In Germany, relevant stakeholder groups (e.g., ethics committees and data protection authorities) specified the broad consent form; however, only one group of patient representatives was consulted, which may indicate asymmetries in engagement. This situation informed our research on medical data donation and emphasized foregrounding patient values. Drawing on participatory design, value sensitive design, and emerging research on value-led participation, we propose a method consisting of (1) a workshop concept for participatory value elicitation composed of four carefully coordinated phases and (2) an analysis procedure to examine the empirical data collected. This analysis allowed us to derive design requirements for medical data donation user interfaces. We conducted three workshops with patient advocates of vulnerable groups and patients in residential care of a psychosomatic unit. Our findings provide new directions to improve user interfaces for medical data donation: First, user interfaces need to enhance patients' reflective thinking about the potential consequences of their data donation; second, a decision facilitator supporting patients' value-based decision-making (e.g., by providing simple language or tailoring descriptions to patient needs); and finally, a data intermediary relieving patients' decision-making and giving them control over their data after donation. Moreover, we emphasize the need to increase the use of participatory approaches in health technology development.",

The twelve participants in their 20s were recruited for a five-day experiment. Through an inductive thematic study, four themes related to the end-user experience in the process of virtual heritage interpretation were identified, as follows: structural components as virtual wider settings, interactive components as life-logging experience, mediating components as an actor, and heritage interpretation components. Then, based on the visual network analysis, we further explored the multiple connections and reciprocal influences of the above themes to uncover differences and similarities in user-perceived experiences in the metaverse compared to existing virtual environments. In addition, we offered insights and design considerations for establishing a participatory heritage interpretation experience in the metaverse.",

While patients often value the ability to bring in different forms of self-report data to convey their lived experiences, they often face challenges in making their data practically usable in clinical settings. To better center patient needs in communicating illness experiences in clinical settings, we explore the idea of patient annotations to digital clinical self-report measures, specifically in the context of discontinuing antidepressants. Through interviews with 20 patients, we found that participants perceived annotations to digital clinical measures as a means to enrich self-report symptom experiences and enhance patient-centered communication. However, concerns were raised regarding potential interruptions in the professional relationship with providers and the need to account for the sensitivity and complexity of mental health contexts. We discuss opportunities for annotations to promote patient-centered communication by balancing patient-centric communication with clinical practicality and incorporating customization support for patients' communication needs.",

      "abstract": "We conducted a co-design study with 26 users in dyadic groups who were assigned to the opposing roles of ``Streamers'' and ``Viewers'' to design interactive, wearable telepresence prototypes for interpersonal use. The goal was to elicit values, identify value tensions, and resolve these tensions in the design of a system that allows Streamers to share their live experiences with a remote Viewer.  Leveraging the lens of value-sensitive design (VSD), we found that these different stakeholders prioritized different values in design, but possibly due to our prompt to design for someone they cared about/knew, often accounted for one another’s needs in their solutions to arrive at designs that were affordable, unobtrusive, and socially acceptable for the Streamer, while giving the Viewer a sense of autonomy. Our work highlights the strengths of co-design when eliciting important human values in the design of sociotechnical systems for wearable telepresence, reconciling value tensions, and conceptualizing novel hardware- and software-based solutions for enhancing the interpersonal telepresence experience of both viewers and streamers. A key insight from our study is that no single system will meet all users' needs; therefore, we should move towards building customizable toolkits to account for differing values and needs.",

With the increased popularity of live stream technologies and the impact of COVID-19, many people have turned to live stream tools to participate in online meditation sessions. To better understand the practices, challenges, and opportunities in live-stream meditation, we conducted a three-month autoethnographic study, during which two researchers participated in live-stream meditation sessions as the audience. Then we conducted a follow-up semi-structured interview study with 10 experienced live meditation teachers who use different live-stream tools. We found that live meditation, although having a weaker social presence than in-person meditation, facilitates attendees in establishing a practice routine and connecting with other meditators. Teachers use live streams to deliver the meditation practice to the world which also enhances their practice and brand building. We identified the challenges of using live-stream tools for meditation from the perspectives of both audiences and teachers, and provided design recommendations to better utilize live meditation as a resource for mental wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we bring to light the infrastructuring work carried out by people in Lebanon to establish and maintain everyday security in response to multiple simultaneously failing infrastructures. We do so through interviews with 13 participants from 12 digital and human rights organisations and two weeks of ethnographically informed fieldwork in Beirut, Lebanon, in July 2022. Through our analysis we develop the notion of security patchworking that makes visible the infrastructuring work necessitated to secure basic needs such as electricity provision, identity authentication and financial resources. Such practices are rooted in differing mechanisms of protection that often result in new forms of insecurity. We discuss the implications for CSCW and HCI researchers and point to security patchworking as a lens to be used when designing technologies to support infrastructuring, while advocating for collaborative work across CSCW and security research.",

      "abstract": "As concerns about employee burnout and skilled staff shortages in cybersecurity grow, our study aims to better understand the contributing factors to burnout in this field. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we analyze self-reported job and personal characteristics, along with digital activity data from 35 incident responders, identifying several factors such as high workload, time pressure, and lack of support from management. Our findings reveal that over half of the participants experience burnout (N=19), which is linked to increased workload, limited control, poor teamwork, and inadequate recognition. Burned-out responders often work more than 40 hours per week, have poor sleep quality, and engage in more email activities, meetings, and after-hour collaborations. Through our research, we also identify coping strategies individuals use to mitigate these stressors. Based on our findings, we provide practical recommendations to help organizations better support their cybersecurity incident response teams. While our study acknowledges limitations and suggests future research directions, it contributes significantly to understanding the challenges faced by cybersecurity incident responders. Our insights offer a comprehensive understanding of burnout factors in this domain and have broader implications for other high-stress work environments consistent with the interdisciplinary nature of CSCW.",

Though increasing attention has been paid to women's health within the social scientific and HCI communities, very little research has holistically explored the unique challenges women face when navigating health misinformation. To address this gap, we conducted a qualitative diary and interview study aimed at investigating women's perceptions and lived experiences of health misinformation on social media, and how they respond emotionally and behaviourally to health misinformation encountered in their day-to-day lives. We found that participants perceived health misinformation as ubiquitous and poorly-managed by social media platforms, resulting in a lack of trust in current moderation and fact-checking interventions. We also observed that encounters with misinformation triggered negative emotional responses, which participants attempted to navigate through ad-hoc strategies such as drawing on personal experience and reading/synthesising social media comment sections, which facilitated collective sensemaking. We discuss our findings in relation to the design of targeted interventions which empower women to engage constructively with health information on social media. In particular, we underscore the importance of trust, accountability, and intersectionality in future design and research practice, and encourage a holistic view of how women are impacted by misinformation.",

      "abstract": "Bots have become critical to the management of communities on platforms, especially to match the growing scale and technical sophistication of online harms. However, community leaders often adopt third-party bots, creating room for misalignment in their assumptions, expectations, and understandings (i.e., their technological frames) about them. On platforms where the sharing of bots can be extremely valuable, how community leaders can revise their frames about bots to more effectively adopt them is unclear. In this work, we conducted a qualitative interview study with 16 community leaders on Discord examining how they adopt third-party bots. We found that participants addressed challenges stemming from uncertainties about a bot's security, reliability, and fit through social ecosystems that emerged around bots. Formal and informal opportunities to discuss bots with others across the platform enabled participants to revise their technological frames over time, closing gaps in bot-specific skills and knowledge. This social process shifted participants' perspectives of the labor of bot adoption into something that was satisfying and fun, underscoring the value of collaborative and communal approaches to adopting bots. Finally, by shaping participants' mental models of the nature, value, and use of bots, these social ecosystems raise some practical tensions in how they supported and constrained participants. Together, the social nature of adopting third-party bots in our interviews offer insight into how we can better support the sharing of user-facing tools across online communities.",

The prior research shed light on user's insecure password behavior, and why the interventions, including requirement specification (e.g., password composition policies) and feedback systems (e.g., password meters) fail in practice. To this end, we propose and evaluate the concept: priming-through-persuasion in the realm of secure password creation. In particular, we created visual designs, aimed at priming users about the repercussions of weak passwords before their password creation. We base our designs on two forms of persuasion methods: pathos and logos. Pathos appeals to people's emotion in order to persuade them towards an expected behavior, where logos-based rhetoric appeals to a person's sense of reason. We conducted a lab study including participatory design and semi-structured interview with 20 participants. We updated our designs in an iterative manner based on the feedback from our participants in the lab study. To evaluate our updated designs, we conducted a between-subject online study with 131 participants over Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our study provides insight into how the use of persuasion techniques contributed to user attachment and engagement with the design, as well as the comprehension of the conveyed message about password vulnerabilities. Our findings lead to the guideline for future research on leveraging the priming-through-persuasion to complement the existing techniques in encouraging users towards secure behavior.",

      "abstract": "Humans need a sense of community (SOC), and social media platforms afford opportunities to address this need by providing users with a sense of virtual community (SOVC). This paper explores SOVC on Reddit and is motivated by two goals: (1) providing researchers with an excellent resource for methodological decisions in studies of Reddit communities; and (2) creating the foundation for a new class of research methods and community support tools that reflect users’ experiences of SOVC. To ensure that methods are respectfully and ethically designed in service and accountability to impacted communities, our work takes a qualitative and community-centered approach by engaging with two key stakeholder groups. First, we interviewed 21 researchers to understand how they study “community” on Reddit. Second, we surveyed 12 subreddits to gain insight into user experiences of SOVC. Results show that some research methods can broadly reflect user experiences of SOVC regardless of the topic or type of subreddit. However, user responses also evidenced the existence of five distinct  Community Archetypes: Topical Q&A, Learning & Perspective Broadening, Social Support, Content Generation, and Affiliation with an Entity. We offer the Community Archetypes framework to support future work in designing methods that align more closely with user experiences of SOVC and to create community support tools that can meaningfully nourish the human need for SOC/SOVC in our modern world.",

      "abstract": "Considerable efforts are currently underway to mitigate the negative impacts of echo chambers, such as increased susceptibility to fake news and resistance towards accepting scientific evidence. Prior research has presented the development of computer systems that support the consumption of news information from diverse political perspectives to mitigate the echo chamber effect. However, existing studies still lack the ability to effectively support the key processes of news information consumption and quantitatively identify a political stance towards the information. \nIn this paper, we present HearHere, an AI-based web system designed to help users accommodate information and opinions from diverse perspectives. HearHere facilitates the key processes of news information consumption through two visualizations. \nVisualization 1 provides political news with quantitative political stance information, derived from our graph-based political classification model, and users can experience diverse perspectives (Hear). Visualization 2 allows users to express their opinions on specific political issues in a comment form and observe the position of their own opinions relative to pro-liberal and pro-conservative comments presented on a map interface (Here). Through a user study with 94 participants, we demonstrate the feasibility of HearHere in supporting the consumption of information from various perspectives. Our findings highlight the importance of providing political stance information and quantifying users' political status as a means to mitigate political polarization. In addition, we propose design implications for system development, including the consideration of demographics such as political interest and providing users with initiatives.",

      "abstract": "Data collections, such as those from citizen science projects, can provide valuable scientific insights or help the public to make decisions based on real demand. At the same time, the collected data might cause privacy risks for their volunteers, for example, by revealing sensitive information. Similar but less apparent trade-offs exist for data collected while using social media or other internet-based services. One approach to addressing these privacy risks might be to anonymize the data, for example, by using Differential Privacy (DP). DP allows for tuning and, consequently, communicating the trade-off between the data contributors' privacy and the resulting data utility for insights. However, there is little research that explores how to communicate the existing trade-off to users. \nWe contribute to closing this research gap by designing  interactive elements and visualizations that specifically support people's understanding of this privacy-utility trade-off. We evaluated our user interfaces in a user study (N=378). Our results show that a combination of graphical risk visualization and interactive risk exploration best supports the informed decision, i.e., the privacy decision is consistent with users' privacy concerns. Additionally, we found that personal attributes, such as numeracy, and the need for cognition, significantly influence the decision behavior and the privacy usability of privacy decision interfaces.\nIn our recommendations, we encourage data collectors, such as citizen science project coordinators, to communicate existing privacy risks to their volunteers since such communication does not impact donation rates. \nFrom a design perspective, we emphasize the complexity of the decision situation and the resulting need to design with usability for all population groups in mind. \nWe hope that our study will inspire further research from the human-computer interaction community that will unlock the full potential of DP for a broad audience and ultimately contribute to a societal understanding of acceptable privacy losses in specific data contexts.",

      "abstract": "What types of governance arrangements makes some self-governed online groups more vulnerable to disinformation campaigns? To answer this question, we present a qualitative comparative analysis of the Croatian and Serbian Wikipedia editions. We do so because between at least 2011 and 2020, the Croatian language version of Wikipedia was taken over by a small group of administrators who introduced far-right bias and outright disinformation; dissenting editorial voices were reverted, banned, and blocked. Although Serbian Wikipedia is roughly similar in size and age, shares many linguistic and cultural features, and faced similar threats, it seems to have largely avoided this fate. Based on a grounded theory analysis of interviews with members of both communities and others in cross-functional platform-level roles, we propose that the convergence of three features -- high perceived value as a target, limited early bureaucratic openness, and a preference for personalistic, informal forms of organization over formal ones -- produced a window of opportunity for governance capture on Croatian Wikipedia. Our findings illustrate that online community governing infrastructures can play a crucial role in systematic disinformation campaigns and other influence operations.",

      "abstract": "Migrants experience unique needs and use social media, in part, to address them. While prior work has primarily focused on migrant populations who are vulnerable socio-economically and legally, less is known about how highly educated migrant populations use social media. Additionally, a growing body of work focuses on algorithmic perceptions and resistance, primarily from laypersons' perspectives rather than people with high degrees of algorithmic literacy. To address these gaps, we draw from interviews with 20 Chinese-born migrant technology professionals. We found that social media played an integral role in helping participants meet their unique needs but that participants perceived social media algorithms to negatively shape the content they consumed, which ultimately influenced their mobility-related aspirations and goals. We discuss how findings challenge the promise of algorithmic literacy and contribute to a human-centered conceptualization of algorithmic mobility as socially and algorithmically produced motion that concerns the movement of physical bodies and interactions as well as associated digital movement. Specifically, we introduce a fourth dimension of algorithmic mobility: algorithmically curated content on social media and elsewhere based on facets of users' identities directly influences users' mobility-related aspirations and goals, such as how, when, and where they go. Finally, we call for transnational policy interventions related to algorithms and highlight design considerations around content moderation, algorithmic user-control, and contestability.",

The majority of work was dedicated towards detecting misinformation with some focus on analyzing the flow of fake news over social networks. However, there is less attention on understanding the characteristics of social media users who consume this fake news. In this work, we investigate the possibility of predicting users’ reactions towards fake news and defining some network characteristics for each users' group. We utilized a set of fact-checking websites in the Arab world that report social media posts spreading fake news and the interactions with them. We defined three sets of users: 1) Spreaders, who spread fake news, 2) Checkers, who constantly share fact-checked news, and 3) Refuters, who respond to fake-news posts declaring their inaccuracy. We build a classifier that uses users’ network graph to predict their reactions with an accuracy exceeding 93\\%. We applied further analysis for the most effective features of each users group and noticed that spreaders interact with more accounts that use their mother tongue, a considerable number of famous state-sponsored accounts, and accounts that get suspended while checkers and refuters interact with more foreign accounts and news-reporting entities. Central nodes in the networks of spreaders were found to be linked with state-sponsored media, whereas central nodes in the networks of checkers included organizations with a cross-cultural nature.",

      "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of AI-generated image tools is transforming the art and design fields, challenging traditional notions of creativity and impacting both professional and non-professional users. For this paper, we define \"professional users\" as individuals who self-identified in our survey as “artists,” “designers,” “filmmakers,” or “art and design students,” and \"non-professional users\" as individuals who self-identified as “others.” This study explores how AI-generated image tools influence these different user groups. Through an online survey (N=380) comprising 173 professional users and 207 non-professional users, we examine differences in the utilization of AI tools, user satisfaction and challenges, applications in creative processes, perceptions and impacts, and acceptance levels. Our findings indicate persistent concerns about image quality, cost, and copyright issues. Additionally, the usage patterns of non-professional users suggest that AI tools have the potential to democratize creative processes, making art and design tasks more accessible to individuals without traditional expertise. This study provides insights into the needs of different user groups and offers recommendations for developing more user-centered AI tools, contributing to the broader discussion on the future of AI in the art and design fields.",

      "abstract": "Despite the growing interest in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for content analysis, current studies have primarily focused on text-based content. In the present work, we explored the potential of LLMs in assisting video content analysis by conducting a case study that followed a new workflow of LLM-assisted multimodal content analysis. The workflow encompasses codebook design, prompt engineering, LLM processing, and human evaluation. We strategically crafted annotation prompts to get LLM Annotations in structured form and explanation prompts to generate LLM Explanations for a better understanding of LLM reasoning and transparency. To test LLM's video annotation capabilities, we analyzed 203 keyframes extracted from 25 YouTube short videos about depression. We compared the LLM Annotations with those of two human coders and found that LLM has higher accuracy in object and activity Annotations than emotion and genre Annotations. Moreover, we identified the potential and limitations of LLM's capabilities in annotating videos. Based on the findings, we explore opportunities and challenges for future research and improvements to the workflow. We also discuss ethical concerns surrounding future studies based on LLM-assisted video analysis.",

      "abstract": "TikTok is one of the most common content-creating social media platforms for youth in the USA. In recent years, its engaging content has significantly influenced people, shaping trends, behaviors, and communication styles among its predominantly young user base. This study evaluates TikTok's impact on college and university students as they invest a lot of time creating content and engaging on TikTok besides their studies. While existing research highlights TikTok's educational benefits and adverse societal and psychological effects, our mixed-method approach provides a focused analysis of student content creators. Survey data quantifies usage patterns and their correlation with academic and mental health indicators, while interviews offer qualitative insights into personal experiences. Findings reveal that TikTok affects students' time management, mental health, academic performance, and self-perception. Although TikTok facilitates creativity and social connections, it also induces stress and distraction. This study aims to fill research gaps and propose new directions, offering practical recommendations for balancing TikTok's benefits and drawbacks for student content creators. ",

      "abstract": "A growing body of research focuses on the machine learning professionals in the Global North, but the perceptions and practices of the professionals in the Global South have remained understudied. For this work, we interviewed 15 AI/ML professionals from Bangladesh to gain insights into their motivations, perceptions, and practices when working with machine learning tools and technologies. Our findings reveal that the machine learning professionals in this region prefer labeled datasets for their work and have lack of  knowledge regarding annotation, design, or representation bias. Their responses also indicate that resource constraints and systematic or organizational barriers limit their capacity to address environmental concerns as well as explainability and privacy issues. Our initial findings highlight the importance of a large-scale study with the machine learning professionals in the Global South.",

Previous qualitative studies indicate that caregiving coordination work changes systematically across illness and treatment phases, but less is known about individuals' technology preferences and how technology needs might change over time. In this study, we employed Q-methodology, a sorting technique for quantitatively analyzing subjective opinion. We interviewed 20 caregivers of children with cancer, who sorted 25 statements about potential design solutions. We describe four distinct caregiving coordination technology archetypes at diagnosis, and show how caregivers' preferences change over time, eventually converging on one set of priorities during extended hospitalization. \r\n",

Inspired by the evolution of privacy research, I argue for expanding accessibility research to influence accessibility in the real world. Similar to privacy, accessibility is driven by a poorly defined core concept and faces comparable challenges including substantial demands placed on software development and the general lack of pushback. By drawing insights from the experiences of the privacy research community, this paper explores the current challenges faced by accessibility research.  In particular, I propose that centralized support and policymaking – two areas currently under-explored within accessibility research – hold rich potential for driving meaningful progress.",

This study examines the attribution of responsibility among relevant stakeholders — companies, developers, and AI — drawing on the attribution theory. Through an online survey (\\textit{n} = 1,173), we investigated user perceptions of normal and abnormal recommendations on YouTube Kids and their attributions across these stakeholders. Our findings reveal significant differences in perceived ethical responsibility among these stakeholders, with AI consistently bearing higher accountability in both scenarios. This underscores the presence of a complex attribution mechanism in human-AI interactions, calling for a refinement of existing attribution theories to better capture the nuanced dynamics of ethical responsibility in this context.",

      "abstract": "Every patient deserves the opportunity to participate in a shared decision-making (SDM) process when deciding on their medical treatment.  However, many cancer patients are not afforded this opportunity, due to barriers such as limited health literacy and lack of access to clinical resources, especially among low-income, rural, and minoritized populations. This prompts a difficult question: Can technologies such as AI serve as useful tools to assist clinicians and patients in their discussions about treatment options?  In this paper, we report a needs-assessment and co-development study involving six medical professionals who were engaged in providing cancer care. Our goal was to establish the conceptual groundwork for developing i-SDM—an AI-based application aimed at fostering more equitable, scalable, and accessible SDM processes. The findings help to clarify the contours of emerging opportunities and challenges for AI integrations in clinical SDM with the goal of improving patient engagement, knowledge, and buy-in for treatment decisions.

This usually leads to prioritizing a particular group of people's experience over the other. If AI-infused systems are to be introduced to these environments, success requires that people (regardless of roles and capacities) feel in control. We performed a preliminary exploratory study with 28 participants on Prolific with ridesharing experience using some ridesharing environment descriptions from the views of different user roles at varying agency levels. We found that prioritizing one group over the other can lead to a net negative experience for all the user groups. Enabling agency for all user groups was more likely to lead to positive characteristics like negotiation and collaboration than the logical expectations of conflict.",

In this work, we present and discuss the results from a CHI 2024 workshop in which 26 experts engaged in a speculative dystopian design fiction activity. Through the structured design fiction exercise, our participants collectively created six design fictions along four main themes highlighting our shared concerns in this problem space. We contribute to CSCW and HCI research by demonstrating the novelty and value of using speculation and design fiction as a methodological tool to engage with research in this emerging problem space. The identified themes and created design fictions also help us speculate plausible and desirable futures regarding new harms in embodied and immersive virtual spaces in the first place, which will inform our future research on envisioning and identifying potential solutions to prevent these harms from becoming reality.\r\n",

      "abstract": "This paper details an investigation into the information management challenges encountered by disability service providers. Prior research has mainly focused on understanding the information management challenges related to user records or internal organizational systems. However, this study posits that the information access patterns of disability services users are significantly influenced by their interactions with service providers' information management practices in localized settings. To explore the challenges associated with accessing disability services information, we conducted interviews with 20 employees from local agencies in Virginia involved in managing disability services and related information. Qualitative analysis revealed four themes related to such information challenges: quality of information, rural access, jurisdictional boundaries, and overwork/emotional work for information providers who are supporting those in need of disabilities services. These findings serve as a foundational step towards a more comprehensive understanding of how organizational information sharing practices and information access for people with disabilities are shaped within both organizations and a wider community context.",

Despite the growing literature on adolescent online safety, mainstream news media continues to be a large influence in shaping public perceptions of online safety. Understanding these narratives is essential for developing effective strategies to protect young internet users. This paper investigates the narratives surrounding youth online safety as depicted in mainstream news media. Through a systematic review of 157 news articles, we found three prevalent narratives: 1) a focus on negative youth risk experiences and heightened concerns regarding mental health issues, 2) an emphasis on restrictive practices as a primary intervention strategy, and 3) a lack of youth perspectives in online safety narratives. Our work highlights significant trends and discrepancies compared to current academic research on youth online safety. The insights from our findings offer important implications for media representation and the development of effective online safety strategies for youth.",

To address this issue, we propose a personalized tool, named the Holistic User-Centered Identification of Threats at the Edge (HUCITE). Our system utilizes probabilistic logic to provide real-time risk estimates for local machines and employs simple cartoons as a user interface. Our approach focuses on identifying anomalies in a single machine and user browsing history for the generation of a personalized green list and global threat information for a shared red list. This approach enables blocking and identification of phishing websites, potentially malicious scripts, unfamiliar domains, and previously unencountered certificate authorities. By creating a zone of safety for a specific user and identifying departures from that zone, our approach addresses the limitations of traditional anomaly detection techniques. We present the underlying architecture and approach to local risk identification, reporting on an in-lab experiment involving 45 participants to test the effectiveness of our system in various stress conditions affecting users' phishing perception.",

A little study to date, considered end users in the loop, to understand the strategies of intruders, and the reactions of victims. We begin to address this gap in our work, where we aim to look through the lens of users' perceptions who had prior experiences of interacting with fake profiles on social media (i.e., victims of fake profiles). To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 participants. Our findings unpack the viewpoints of fake-profile victims, with regard to intruders' traits and strategies to befriend them on social media, as well as their reactions when they realize that they have interacted with a fake profile. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations on empowering and supporting social media users in order to alleviate their vulnerability to online exploitation.",

Even though users and moderators may currently be reinforcing behavior through positive feedback, we do not understand what type of content is being reinforced. We aim to fill that gap by uncovering how often prosocial metrics from prior work appear in posts that receive positive feedback compared to those that do not. We find that existing measures of prosocial behavior are insufficient for capturing the content-level differences between rewarded posts and non-rewarded posts. We call for future work to better understand this problem and to dive deeper into the area of positive reinforcement in moderation.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Analyzing large sets of visual media remains a challenging task, particularly in mixed-method studies dealing with problematic information and human subjects. Using AI tools in such analyses risks reifying and exacerbating biases, as well as untenable computational and cost limitations. As such, we turn to adopting geometric computer graphics and vision methods towards analyzing a large set of images from a problematic information campaign, in conjunction with human-in-the-loop qualitative analysis. We illustrate an effective case of this approach with the implementation of color quantization towards analyzing online hate image at the US-Mexico border, along with a historicist trace of the history of color quantization and skin tone scales, to inform our usage and reclamation of these methodologies from their racist origins. To that end, we scaffold motivations and the need for more researchers to consider the advantages and risks of reclaiming such methodologies in their own work, situated in our case study. \r\n",

      "abstract": "The growth of scientific literature poses a significant challenge for researchers and librarians. It is part of many librarians’ core responsibilities to be able to identify and utilize appropriate research tools and databases to assist and advise scholars engaged in research. The recent proliferation of machine learning supported tools has created a tremendous gap in literature addressing the actual efficacy of these new tools, even as compared to conventional library databases. This work aims to build knowledge of these new tools (Scite, Elicit, SciSpace, Epsilon) by comparing search results within defined parameters, and evaluating results for format, topic relevance and uniqueness. By understanding the strengths and limitations of these tools, researchers will be better positioned to make informed decisions about their literature search. \r\n",

      "abstract": "Scholars, politicians, and journalists have raised alarm over the potential for AI-generated photos, video, and audio — often referred to as deepfakes — to reduce trust in one another and our institutions. Despite these clarion calls, little empirical work exists on how deepfakes are being used to harm individuals outside of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII). This research provides a preliminary analysis of 50 wide-ranging incidents of deepfake harm. We find that the most common types of harm are relational, systemic, financial, and emotional. Apart from AI-generated NCII, the most prevalent uses of deepfakes to cause harm were instances of mis- and disinformation, fraud, and misrepresentation of or stereotyping about marginalized groups (e.g., women and racial minorities). We concluded with recommendations for future work and discuss potential challenges in identifying, quantifying, and preventing harm caused by deepfakes both online and off.",

However, tools to verify whether these technologies conform to user expectations remain largely unexplored. We investigate this problem in the domain of binaural beats - a popular mental wellbeing technology. Using results from preliminary research, where we establish commonly held user expectations and introduce a method to measure expectation conformance, we explore the design of a tool to be used by binaural beats listeners. Through a pre-design survey with 43 participants and a user study with 28 participants, we demonstrate how tools leveraging commonly held user expectations can help users of mental wellbeing applications make informed decisions.",

This paper presents the application of a design-based research framework, integrating Wizard of Oz techniques, intervention design, and decision trees to simulate an adaptive learning platform. This platform dynamically encourages collaborative efforts among students based on their social learning tendencies. Theories of social learning highlight the importance of social interactions in facilitating effective learning outcomes, particularly in remote learning environments. Our research methodology adopts an interdisciplinary approach, drawing insights from social learning theory to explore system concepts within a fluid framework. By employing this methodology, we seek to contribute to ongoing discussions aimed at enhancing technology-supported learning environments.",

Current research mainly focuses on pre-recorded video learning, lacking studies on older adults' live stream workout experiences. This study explores \"pat-pat exercise\" (a traditional Chinese wellness method) favored by older TikTok users. Using qualitative methods, we analyzed live stream comments and conducted semi-structured interviews with ten older adults. We found that live stream workouts can positively impact older adults by strengthening emotional connections with loved ones and evoking nostalgic memories. However, they also faced challenges such as a lack of confidence from comparisons with hosts, communication barriers, and difficulty in receiving targeted reinforcement training. Based on the Fogg Behavior Model, we propose design principles and a comprehensive plan for age-friendly live stream workouts.",

      "abstract": "Identifying design problems is a crucial step for creating plausible solutions, but it is challenging for design novices due to their limited knowledge and experience. Questioning is a promising skill that enables students to independently identify design problems without being passive or relying on instructors. This study explores role-playing interactions with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Conversational Agents (CAs) to foster the questioning skills of novice design students. We proposed an LLM-powered CA prototype and conducted a preliminary study with 16 novice design students engaged in a real-world design class to observe the interactions between students and the LLM-powered CAs. Our findings indicate that while the CAs stimulated questioning and reduced pressure to ask questions, it also inadvertently led to over-reliance on LLM responses. We proposed design considerations and future works for LLM-powered CA to foster questioning skills.",

      "abstract": "Demographic differences lead to inequitable access to social resources, a trend that tends to be mirrored on social media platforms. On localized social networks, where people are mostly exposed to content written by others in their vicinity, there is potential for these offline differences to result in vastly different experiences online. This study focuses on the behavioral and structural content differences between neighborhoods on Nextdoor, a hyperlocal social media platform. We identify six different types of Nextdoor neighborhoods: high posting, low posting, high engagement, low engagement, high advertising, and high information seeking. While high/low posting neighborhoods are understandably mostly predicted by neighborhood population, high advertising and low in-\r\nformation seeking neighborhoods are additionally predicted by a low percentage of white people. Our results show that not only the content, but the structural differences in posting behavior between neighborhoods, can lead to divergent experiences on local social\r\nmedia platforms. These findings complicate existing theories that higher income neighborhoods have more frequent exchanges of social capital in local online social media environments.",

Prior studies pointed to children's poor password habit and vague perceptions on the significance of passwords. While users must be sufficiently motivated to perform a target behavior, a little study to date, focused on understanding how we can encourage children towards strong password creation. As we begin to address this gap, we examined children's perceptions of adversary's actions that instill fear in the context of password compromise. Our semi-structured interviews with 20 children (aged between 8 and 12) reveal their concerns around a hacker, which inform future designs how fear appeal can be leveraged as a motivational tool for children towards strong passwords.",

SaludConectaMX is unique in that it integrates patient clinical indicators with social determinants and caregiver mental health, forming a social-clinical perspective of the patient's evolving health trajectory. The system is composed of a web application (for hospital staff) and a mobile application (for family caregivers), providing the opportunity for cooperative patient monitoring in both hospital and home settings. This paper presents the system's preliminary design and usability evaluation results from a 1.5-year pilot study. Our findings indicate that while the hospital web app demonstrates high completion rates and user satisfaction, the family mobile app requires additional improvements for optimal accessibility; statistical and qualitative data analysis illuminate pathways for system improvement. Based on this evidence, we formalize suggestions for health system development in LMICs, which HCI researchers may leverage in future work.",

In this study, we explore the interruptibility of scientific researchers and its correlation with contextual factors such as deadlines, outside-work hours, and location. We report in-progress findings from an autoethnographic study building on an analysis of interaction logs, as well as location and calendar data. This analysis provides a unique perspective on research projects that run for several months, revealing situations in which we allow ourselves to be interrupted. Our preliminary results provide metrics that highlight periods of high interruptibility and present initial results of a correlation analysis between interruptibility and work context. Our findings reveal that as deadlines approach, the urgency leads to longer uninterrupted work periods and the work is prioritized over other projects. Evening and weekend work is also more conducive to sustained work periods, whereas summer work and work done in close proximity to others is generally more fragmented.",

Generally, speech-based tutoring systems interpret the users' long pauses as a signal to take the floor. However, such behavior creates barriers for minority and low-literacy individuals who pause mid-sentence just to finish articulating their thoughts. For them, these systems inappropriately interrupt them, resulting in frustration. In this study, we present a bigram pause detection model that determines whether a pause is occurring in the middle or at the end of a sentence and implemented this model on an ITS (MODIFIED). We also compared the effect of this modification with a baseline ITS that interprets long pauses as the end of a turn (TRADITIONAL). Our results show that participants interacted longer with MODIFIED, and perceive it more human-like than the TRADITIONAL system. We argue that conversational systems need to be designed considering unique needs of their intended interlocutors.",

      "abstract": "Scholarship in CSCW, HCI, and STS has critiqued the moral imperative to scale up and to value scalability. These insights have yet to be applied in the burgeoning research on platform-mediated work and worker resistance. Grounded in two years of in-person and virtual participant observation with gig worker activists, this paper undertakes an “ethnography of scale” to concretely account for how the activists represent and manage a global-scale movement. I argue that although the activists construct their movement as global, it is not \\textit{scalable} in the sense of being able to uniformly expand without changing the nature of the project. Rather, the movement’s global scale can be seen as occurring through a process of proliferation, where scale is enacted through mutually transforming engagements. This paper contributes an empirical investigation of gig worker resistance by drawing on the concepts of nonscalability and proliferation.",

This study investigates user reviews from the Google Play Store for the Replika chatbot, focusing on complaints of online sexual harassment. Using Activity Theory, the analysis reveals several contradictions within the Replika activity system, including tool-subject, tool-object, rule-subject, rule-object, and distribution of labor-subject and labor-object contradictions. These contradictions highlight the misalignment between user expectations and the chatbot's behavior, inadequate safety measures, and unrealistic expectations placed on users to train the AI. The study emphasizes the need for clearer objectives, advanced AI alignment techniques, and refined safety protocols to enhance the user experience and ensure ethical interactions with chatbots. We provide implications for guidelines on the development of more trustworthy and supportive digital companions.",

      "abstract": "Preserving linguistic dialects is paramount for preserving cultural identity, fostering diversity, and maintaining cultural prestige. In the context of Bengali, the language exhibits religious distinctions through its two major dialects: the West Bengal (Hindu majority) and Bangladesh (Muslim majority) dialects, deeply rooted in the historical evolution of Bangla. Understanding and respecting these dialect-based nuances is crucial for Human-AI collaborative tools to generate culturally appropriate content and effectively assist human writers without limiting their creativity. To address these challenges, we introduce DiaFrame, a comprehensive framework tailored for understanding and tuning dialects in human-AI collaborative creative writing spaces, focusing on Bengali. It integrates advanced components such as active learning, real-time processing of human feedback, memory management, and contextual understanding to enhance user experience and ensure culturally sensitive content generation. Our contributions include providing a holistic end-to-end solution that enables the AI model to actively learn, adapt, and generate content aligned with user preferences and dialectical variations, ultimately fostering effective collaboration between humans and AI in creative writing endeavors.",

To contribute to a cooperative discourse on FRTs, in this paper, we first perform an integrative literature review and investigate the advantages, risks, areas of application, and stakeholders. Based on this analysis, we then design and facilitate a multi-stakeholder workshop aimed at cooperatively assessing the technology's impact. Workshop findings reveal significant differences in the positions held by stakeholders, indicating differing perspectives on the subject. The results from our study underscore the need for careful impact assessments before deploying FRTs, as well as stakeholder engagement through sustained and well-informed dialogues to cooperatively determine technical feasibility for specific use cases and short- and long-term societal impact. The insights from our research can serve as guidance for future work. We discuss the study's results, provide policy recommendations for the governance of FRTs, and share the framework for a 2.5h stakeholder workshop on the impact of FRTs.",

      "abstract": "Content creators' work has long been reused by various technology developers and researchers; recently joining the ranks of content reusers are emergent generative AI models. However, creators' perspectives and acceptances of these use cases were often overlooked in the process. We present our initial findings on how content creators perceive scenarios of content reuse as acceptable, negotiable, or unacceptable. We surveyed  478 content creators on Instagram and a non-trivial percentage of respondents found content reuse for search engine display, education, and academic research acceptable. Conversely, content reuse for commercial or non-profit generative AI models was a negotiable scenario for most respondents. Receiving compensation was likely to make almost all use cases more acceptable to content creators. Our work paves the way for future work into understanding how creators value their work, research ethics, and best practices for using user-generated content for responsible technological innovation.

      "abstract": "A substantial portion of political discourse today has shifted to social media platforms like Reddit. These platforms have integrated reaction mechanisms, such as upvoting and downvoting, which are intended to enable users to quickly respond to posts and promote engagement. However, it is unclear how users in political online communities perceive the influence of these reaction mechanisms on community discourse and dynamics and what strengths or weaknesses they perceive about the reaction mechanism. Therefore, we conducted a qualitative interview study with five Reddit users who participate in communities focusing on socially and politically important issues. Our study reveals that the current upvoting and downvoting reaction mechanism on Reddit can be used to reinforce community majority opinion and homogeneity in some political subreddits, which especially discourages new users with different perspectives from participating in conversations. Additionally, participants unanimously expressed a preference for more nuanced reaction mechanisms that facilitate clearer feedback.",

Emotes are custom-made images, or GIFs, used in chat with varying degrees of access influenced by channel and external site subscription status. Emotes render  standard forms of English Natural Language Processing (NLP) for tasks such as detection of toxicity or cyberbullying ineffective on Twitch.  In this paper, we propose a methodology and offer a largely-trained dataset for detecting emote-based toxicity on live streaming platforms such as Twitch. ",

However, LLMs may often be regarded as a panacea because of their powerful capabilities with an accompanying oversight on whether they are suitable for their intended tasks. We contend that LLMs should be adopted in a critical manner following rigorous evaluation. Accordingly, we present the evaluation of an LLM in identifying logical fallacies that will form part of a digital misinformation intervention. By comparing to a labeled dataset, we found that GPT-4 achieves an accuracy of 0.79, and for our intended use case that excludes invalid or unidentified instances, an accuracy of 0.90. This gives us the confidence to proceed with the application of the LLM while keeping in mind the areas where it still falls short. The paper describes our evaluation approach, results and reflections on the use of the LLM for our intended task.",

However, personalized care can be difficult for patients with limited medical knowledge to understand their care management options to make an optimal decision that meets their needs and circumstances.  This paper introduces two broadly applicable Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches — namely, the outcome-first framework and its group variant —specifically designed to alleviate the decision-making burden in treatment plan selection. Diverging from traditional overview-centered frameworks, both outcome-first and group-first frameworks introduce an innovative approach by providing patients lacking AI or clinical backgrounds with a transparent decision-making structure. These frameworks were evaluated through efficiency testing and a pilot study involving ten clinicians and patients. The findings reveal that the outcome-first framework can significantly reduce the number of comparisons. This reduction streamlines the decision-making process and proves advantageous for patients, enabling them to select the optimal option that aligns with their criteria.",

However, the impact of interactivity within these applications on children's learning and engagement remains unexplored. While current apps may employ various levels of interactions, such as visual, haptic, sound, and animation, the efficacy of these interactions in facilitating children's learning remains uncertain.  This research investigates how varying levels of interactivity in touch-based interfaces, combined with an AI voice agent, affect the learning of counting skills in children aged 2 to 4 years. We examine three conditions: baseline (no demonstration), animated demonstration, and interactive demonstration. By examining how these different levels of interactivity influence children's engagement with math apps, this study seeks to enhance our understanding of effective design strategies for educational technology targeting early childhood education. The findings of this research hold the potential to inform the development of interfaces for math games that leverage both touch-based interactions and AI voice assistants to support young children's learning of foundational mathematical concepts.",

This pilot study explores how mutual aid organizations leverage technology to create this day-to-day care. We conducted five interviews with mutual aid organizers to gather perspectives on the perceived opportunities and challenges of organizing mutual aid efforts through ICTs. We engaged in semi-structured interviews informed by Spade's mutual aid framework, which identifies to: 1) meet the survival needs of people, 2) mobilize people, build movements, and expand solidarity among communities, and 3) solve problems through people’s collective actions. Our pilot interviews identify the limitations of this framework surrounding how organizers use ICTs for their work and lay the groundwork for a subsequent phase to develop a framework that connects an understanding of mutual aid’s goals and how organizers leverage ICTs to achieve them.",

During such long-term monitoring, patients are admitted to the hospital, physically connected to devices, and closely monitored for extended periods of time. Through twenty-five interviews with people with epilepsy who underwent long-term EEGs, we unpack the complex patient experience of inpatient monitoring. We find that inpatient monitoring enabled participants to learn about and reflect on their chronic illness, but it also amplified participants' anxiety and frustration. We discuss contributions to HCI research on long-term monitoring and the lived experience of epilepsy, and present design implications to support patients during monitoring.",

      "abstract": "As mental health influences many aspects of the college student’s life, including academic performance and interpersonal relationships, it has become an area of interest at many American universities. Previous studies have highlighted the benefits of technology-mediated mental health support tools, such as low cost and anonymity — benefits that are often missing in traditional face-to-face therapy sessions. However, existing interventions are built for individuals in mainstream cultures, and do not address cultural differences and diversity of marginalized students. This study explores mental health counselors’ experiences with international students in a major research university in the United States. Through semi-structured interviews with 7 mental health counselors, the study discusses the design implications, including the importance of focusing on factors that students can control and helping students to be their genuine selves without concerns of being judged. Identified factors will be applied to a design probe study with international students.",

This will soon be followed by cross-reality experiences that support social interaction—and potential harm—across virtual and physical reality, as exemplified by emerging VR dating applications. This paper presents a participatory design study of VR dating with 16 stakeholders identifying as women and/or LGBTQIA+ to reflect on how safety can be designed for in cross-reality—not as a reaction to harm that is already occurring, but as a proactive initiative to address fears that may limit technology adoption and inclusion. Findings elucidate three types of cross-reality harms that participants identified as most related to a sense of safety: physical harm as retaliation for romantic rejection across realities, unintentional physical harm through assuming consent to similar behaviors across realities, as well as risks associated with misinformed decisions to meet in the physical world. Design directions to instill a sense of cross-reality safety involved augmented consent exchange capabilities and intervention of virtually and physically co-located bystanders.",

Since this overturn of this law, substantial public discourse was noticed across the US and this controversial issue has trended on all news media agencies and social media platforms. Several studies have analyzed public opinion and the impact of this legal change on healthcare, economic challenges, and society. However, little work has been done to identify the shift in discussion over time. Our research analyzes YouTube and Reddit comments to perceive insights into the evolving spectrum of public opinion on abortion legislation by utilizing NLP techniques and opinion mining. By systematically categorizing comments to extract themes and employing a temporal analysis approach, we identify shifts in public sentiment across different phases of time, such as immediate reactions, peak debate, and long-term responses. Our preliminary findings show that different themes prevail at different phases and primary concerns shift over time. This study might help policymakers, activists, and social commentators understand these shifts to effectively address the evolving concerns of the public and take measures accordingly.",

      "abstract": "Modern medical issues can cover multiple fields and disciplines, requiring inter-organizational collaboration among healthcare professionals from different specialized background. Shareable medical systems support the distribution of patients’ electronic medical record (EMRs) to a variety of specialists, but most of them have no effective resolution mechanisms for concurrent update conflicts on the same EMR, hindering their collaborative abilities. \r\nIn order to break this limitation, we designed a tree-structured conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT) for storing general EMRs and implemented a collaborative EMR prototype system for a hypothetical application scenario. Experimented by simulation in a distributed environment, it is demonstrated that this CRDT-based solution can resolve concurrent conflicts arising from multi-user simultaneous updates on a patient’s EMR, with acceptable consumption on both memory and time in engineering. This not only provides an efficient and reliable concurrency control mechanism for the next-generation EMR systems, but also for other collaborative applications towards the new era of healthcare.",

While Generative AI has a multitude of exciting applications for the fields of writing, coding, and graphic design, its usage to personalize our virtual space has not yet been explored. In this paper, we investigate the application of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) to personalize our virtual spaces and enhance the metaverse experience. To this end, we present a pipeline to enable users to customize their virtual spaces. Moreover, we explore the hardware resources and latency required for personalized spaces, as well as user acceptance of the AI-generated spaces. Comprehensive user studies follow extensive system experiments. Our research evaluates users' perceptions of two generated spaces: panoramic images and 3D virtual spaces. According to our findings, users have shown a great interest in 3D personalized spaces, and the practicality and immersion of 3D space generation tools surpass panoramic space generation tools.",

Despite these advantages, its application in caring for older adults with neurodegenerative disorders (NDD) remains largely unexplored, even though the World Health Organization (WHO) identifies NDD as a major global health burden. This study investigates the perceptions of soft robotics among individuals with neurodegenerative diseases. Through focus groups, individual interviews, and co-design sessions with patients, clinicians, and caregivers, we explored usability, safety, concerns, emotional comfort, and design ideas for soft robotics. Our findings highlight the necessity for user-centered design to address these concerns, emphasizing the importance of creating multi-purpose technologies that can be used by both patients and caregivers to support each other and build relationships. This approach aims to enhance the acceptance and effectiveness of soft robotic technologies for this vulnerable population.\r\n",

However, little is known about how OSS developers view the relative benefits and drawbacks of governmental funding compared to other funding sources. This study explores this question through a case study on scikit-learn, a Python library for machine learning, funded by public research grants, commercial sponsorship, micro-donations, and a €32 million grant announced in France’s artificial intelligence strategy. Through 25 interviews with scikit-learn’s maintainers and funders, this study makes two key contributions. First, it contributes empirical findings about the benefits and drawbacks of public and private funding for OSS developers, and the governance protocols employed by the maintainers to balance the diverse interests of their funders and community. Second, it offers practical lessons on funding for OSS developers, governments, and companies based on the experience of scikit-learn. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research and practice.",

However, these devices often present complex graphics, difficult interfaces, and inappropriate assistance features, which hinder their use by older individuals. To address this, we conducted a formative interview and found that the elderly need simple and positive signals, psychological support through objects, and guidance for preventing over-exercise in EWDs. Thus, we propose LIFEELING, a fitness tracking and reminder system that combines the traditional bracelet form factor with the prevalent concept of \"detoxification\" among the Chinese elderly.  Additionally, LIFEELING can provide positive psychological sustenance using the metaphor of \"detoxification\" and mimic design. Meanwhile, it can monitor the user's heart rate and assist with breathing adjustments. A preliminary study helps us understand how the elderly perceive it and better position our contributions.",

      "abstract": "The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, including in caring for cancer survivors, has gained significant interest. However, gaps remain in our understanding of how such AI systems can provide care, especially for ethnic and racial minority groups who continue to face care disparities. Through interviews with six cancer survivors, we identify critical gaps in current healthcare systems such as a lack of personalized care and insufficient cultural and linguistic accommodation. The findings suggest the potential for AI to address these issues by enabling real-time, culturally aligned, and linguistically appropriate interactions. \r\nWe also uncovered concerns about the implications of AI-driven personalization, such as data privacy, loss of human touch in caregiving, and the risk of echo chambers that limit exposure to diverse information. We conclude by discussing the trade-offs between AI-enhanced personalization and the need for structural changes in healthcare that go beyond technological solutions.",

As image generation technology has been developed and its use has increased, this study investigated the effect of image generation of political news articles on readers' perception and response to the articles. We first examined the primary elements that characterize political news articles and used the latest text-to-image model with these elements to generate images appropriate for liberal/conservative media articles. The results of the user study with 102 participants showed that the generated images reflected the content of the articles better than the original images and facilitated the understanding of the articles. In particular, conservative participants preferred generated images in factual reports, and liberal participants preferred generated images in biased reports, suggesting a careful consideration of the use of generated images in information delivery. Our study opens up new possibilities for the use of AI in journalism, where providing fair and clear information to readers and reducing political polarization is important.",

      "abstract": "Remote patient monitoring (RPM) involves the remote collection and transmission of patient health data, serving as a notable application of data-driven healthcare. This technology facilitates clinical monitoring and decision-making, offering benefits like reduced healthcare costs and improved patient outcomes. However, RPM also introduces challenges common to data-driven healthcare, such as additional data work that can disrupt clinician's workflow. This study explores the daily practices, collaboration mechanisms, and sensemaking processes of nurses in RPM through field observations and interviews with six stakeholders. Preliminary results indicate that RPM's scale-up pushes clinicians toward asynchronous collaboration. Data sensemaking is crucial for this type of collaboration, but existing technologies often create friction rather than support. This work provides empirical insights into clinical workflow in nursing practice, especially RPM. We suggest recognizing data sensemaking as a distinct nursing practice within data work and recommend further investigation into its role in the workflow of nurses in RPM.",

In this paper, we interview 11 entrepreneurs and support personnel to investigate existing practices of how entrepreneurs integrate generative AI technologies into their business workflows. Specifically, we build on scholarship in HCI which emphasizes the role of small, offline networks in supporting entrepreneurs’ technology maintenance. We detail how entrepreneurs resourcefully leveraged their local networks to discover new use-cases of generative AI (e.g. by sharing accounts), assuage heightened techno-anxieties (e.g. by recruiting trusted confidants), overcome barriers to sustained use (e.g. by receiving wrap-around support), and establish boundaries of use. Further, we suggest how generative AI platforms may be redesigned to better support entrepreneurs, such as by taking into account the benefits and tensions of use in a social context.",

Yet, few researchers have explored how decisions around technology use are made in the church. To address this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five Black Church leaders to understand how church leaders interact with digital technologies, both in general and specifically with the communities that they serve. We found that while Black Church leaders are eager to engage with technology, most of the engagement with outside communities is through in-person contact; opportunities to give online have a financial penalty in comparison to traditional methods of tithing and donating; lastly, technology use within outreach and ministries is highly dependent by ministry leaders -- many who volunteer their time. We contribute to research that focuses on technology use in religious organizations and community engagement of community-based organizations.",

In Phase I, 58 participants used Dot Voting to identify top cyber-security priorities, including password management, privacy, and avoiding scams. This informed Phase II, where we held focus groups with 31 participants from rural and urban communities in Ireland. Researchers provided tailored advice through presentations and leaflets, followed by open discussions. Our findings show that, despite being highly aware of cyber-scams, older adults remain very concerned about them. Participants expressed hesitation about using online password managers and two-factor authentication but valued advice on privacy and tools that can help them feel more in control online.",

With perinatal mental health concerns affecting many women and technology playing a role in addressing their challenges, the study investigated LLMs' ability to craft relatable stories considering emotional nuances, cultural sensitivity, and narrative variation. Of the 45 stories generated, 85\\% (n=38) adhered to prompts. Qualitative analysis identified challenges with relatability, such as repetitive content and diminished empathy compared to user-generated stories. However, despite limitations, AI-generated stories showcased the potential for raising awareness about perinatal wellbeing.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Water conflicts in agricultural watersheds pose significant challenges for effective resource management. This study presents a novel approach to identifying potential water conflicts within water user organizations by integrating socio-hydrological data into an agent-based modeling tool, SHABM (Socio-Hydrological Agent-Based Model). The model simulates interactions between the Water Board, Canal Administrator, Farmers, and Crops, considering water distribution rates, crop water demands, farmer personalities, and irrigation infrastructure, among others. The study area is located in the Longaví River basin, Chile, and simulations were conducted from 2017 to 2022, considering various scenarios of canal lining and oversight levels. Results demonstrate the tool's ability to identify potential conflict areas and provide insights into the evolution of farmer decision-making. Integrating geospatial data, hydrological models, and social information proves crucial for achieving comprehensive water management and addressing complex water-related challenges in agricultural contexts. The SHABM tool has the potential to support decision-making processes and promote sustainable water governance in regions facing water scarcity and competing demands.",

We conducted research to understand how technology is used in hospital classrooms, an area which has been relatively underexplored. We conducted semi-structured interviews with five hospital teachers to understand their experience of using technology in and outside the classroom. Our findings revealed that hospital teachers often rely on older curricula given the changing education atmosphere; learning is often assessed through in-classroom observations of mastery; and technology and internet use by students is often restricted, which may inhibit opportunities to use AI and other technical resources in the classroom. We contribute a deeper understanding of technology use in the hospital classroom.",

Focusing on how language evolves within the community over time, we analyze lexical trends and participant language adaptation. Lexical entrainment, or the convergence of language styles among users, was assessed to understand its impact on participant retention and community cohesion. Our findings reveal that as volunteers engage with the project, notable shifts in language patterns occur, potentially reflecting changes in their roles and integration into the community. The results demonstrate that sustained engagement correlates with deeper linguistic alignment, focused on enhancing collaborative efforts and knowledge production. These results can inform the design of more effective communication strategies and collaborative tools, ultimately improving the productivity and cohesiveness of collaboration in other open collaboration communities.\r\n",

With diverse preferences and possibly conflicting requirements, collaborative booking tools must also promote agreement. Informed by effective mediation principles, we design CREST to drive users through the stages of group booking: search, discuss, and agree. Templated messages inserted by CREST-bot, a rule-driven agent that embodies one of many mediator roles, nudge users to consider certain properties, engage in conversations, negotiate better terms through house rules, and finally sign a contract to conclude the process. Through a mixed-methods user study, we evaluate how CREST’s novel, mediation-inspired features lead to more satisfying outcomes over a baseline that implements state-of-the-art collaborative search features.",

      "abstract": "News readers often need to filter articles of their interests and seek needed information in the selected article. However, they may face clickbait titles and redundant content, which could reduce their news filtering efficiency and reading experience. In this paper, we develop a technical prototype SummarFlex to explore news filtering and reading with query-focused hierarchical summarization. In SummarFlex, users can filter articles with generated titles that are relevant to the queried keywords. When reading a selected article, users can specify keywords to generate a high-level summary of the full content and click a sentence to get an expanded summary hierarchically. A within-subject study (𝑁 = 20) shows that compared to a baseline tool without the summarization features, SummarFlex significantly improves users’ efficiency in finding interested articles and comprehension of needed information in the article. We conclude with design insights for supporting news filtering and reading with machine-generated content.",

This interface integrates advanced speech-to-text and TTS technologies, facilitating real-time communication for educational settings. The speech-to-text technology transcribes the teacher's spoken words into text, displayed on an immersive augmented reality headset. Additionally, TTS technology vocalizes the student's typed responses through a virtual keyboard, enabling verbal communication with the teacher and peers. By focusing on cooperative learning and social computing, this study explores how to implement a conversational user interface, ensuring trustworthiness and reliability. Preliminary design insights and strategic implementation efforts aim to demonstrate the interface's potential as a transformative communication tool in assistive technology. The research highlights the collaborative aspects of educational environments, showing how augmented reality can enhance student social interaction. This research uses advanced technology to support, mediate, and enhance human social interactions, creating more inclusive and effective educational experiences.",

In collaboration with medical experts and older female patients, we developed a serious exergame based on mixed reality (MR) technology to assist with pelvic floor muscle (PFM) rehabilitation. The game design incorporates physical exercise plans with platform-jumping gamified mechanics, utilizing visual algorithms to recognize the player’s leg movements and provide real-time feedback within a virtual environment. Although we have not yet conducted final user experiments, the feedback from experts who reviewed our prototype indicates its strong potential for improving user motivation and training effectiveness. Future plans include collaborative testing with real patients to further validate the game's usability and its impact on promoting long-term training.",

Prior research has defined these socially and culturally constructed definitions about what data are and what data do as “data imaginaries.” This study draws on 40 qualitative interviews with community organizers involved in issues like immigration, reproductive justice, education, and policing. Our study takes metaphors given to us by community organizers (i.e., ammunition, teeth, receipts, compass) to reveal their data imaginaries. Particularly, their data imaginaries define what data means to them and what purpose it serves in their organizing. We find that community organizers also shared critiques of the ways data has been used to oppress minoritized groups. Given these findings, we conclude by encouraging future work that explores how community organizers experience and articulate epistemic burdens. ",

      "abstract": "Older adults in China face numerous barriers to physical exercise. Most related studies have focused on environmental and health factors, while the impact of family responsibilities has been overlooked. Through interviews, this paper finds that most older adults bear primary responsibility for raising their grandchildren, sacrificing their free time for exercise. As a result, they desire to exercise but are unable to do so. In response, we propose the Farmily system, targeting preschool grandchildren aged 3 to 7 and grandparents aged 50 to 75. This system assists grandparents in engaging in physical exercise while caregiving by facilitating co-exercise with their grandchildren. We construct a flexible game framework by transforming the grandparent-grandchild relationship from unilateral dominance to bilateral cooperation, as exemplified through a farm game. We hope this system will provide innovative strategies for improving physical exercise among grandparents who care for their grandchildren.",

      "abstract": "Over the past decade, community collaborations have come into focus within the HCI and CSCW fields. Largely the result of increased concern for social and contextual dimensions of practice, these partnerships facilitate a pathway for researchers and practitioners to foreground the nuances of technology as it takes place in the real world. How these collaborations are engaged, what values mediate them, and how practices might vary across geographies remain active research questions. In this paper, we contribute by zooming into the experience of four HCI and CSCW researchers engaging in community collaborations in Latin America (LATAM). Through a collaborative autoethnography (CAE), we identify three main value tensions impacting HCI practices and methods in research collaborations with LATAM communities: camaraderie vs. cautiousness, informality vs. formality and hopefulness vs. transparency. Building on our findings, we provide three recommendations for researchers interested in engaging in community-based research in similar contexts.\r\n",

However, in the absence of scientifically validated exercise guidelines, older adults are susceptible to adopting excessive or inappropriate exercise methods that may be detrimental to their health. In research related to the elderly's exercise conceptions, the potential for community-engaged investigations has been mentioned. However, no study has proposed a community-based systematic design approach to reshape these misconceptions. Our study closely examined six elderly individuals inclined to exercise near their homes to research on their perception on daily excercise. Then we propose a new design paradigm that integrates an AI Chatbot, FitPal, for personalized exercise guidance and community-driven incentives to correct misconceptions and encourage long-term adherence to exercise among elders.",

      "abstract": "In democratic society, few processes are more consequential than the mechanisms for funding public goods. The subject of this study is one attempt to demonstrate such a mechanism: a real-world experiment to pioneer a concept called Universal Basic Philanthropy. In this experiment, a local nonprofit in the city of Albuquerque distributed free money to individuals to reallocate to other local nonprofits of their choosing. Over the course of approximately four years, the project facilitated $145,641 over 13,812 donations from 702 people to 59 organizations. In this study, I use publicly available transaction data from the Albuquerque pilot project to explore the following question: how we can better understand social demand for public goods? Using a network approach, I characterize the organizations supported by participants in the project using three measures of graph centrality: intensity, popularity, and connectivity. I use natural language processing to embed, cluster, and aggregate these centrality measures at the level of causes. The paramount result is as follows: organizations in arts, culture, and education have a comparative advantage in the intensity of fundraising while organizations in civics, basic needs, and other causes have a comparative advantage in connectivity",

      "abstract": "We focus on occupational diversity in platform-mediated work. We do so to advance the conceptual and empirical understanding of how occupational structures and related work demands lead to different use cases and design needs by platform workers. Homogenizing diverse occupations into an undifferentiated group and calling them platform workers disguises the specific characteristics and challenges inherent in individual occupations. This creates the false equivalence of treating ridesharing and contract information security work into gigs. To illuminate the nature and characteristic of occupational diversity in mediating platform work experiences, we report interim findings from a comparative analysis of 71 platform workers pursuing online freelance work, classified across five distinct occupational groups. The findings reveal that platform work experiences vary based on three occupational attributes: industry, job, individual. These distinct occupational attributes shape two different platform work experiences: flexibility and skill development. These findings provide a structured means to understand occupational diversity in platform work, informing future research aimed at designing digital labor platform experiences that tailor to the diverse occupational needs and preferences of workers.",

The lack of providers’ motivation to work in underserved communities also reduces the quality of healthcare services.  HCI and healthcare researchers strive to address immigrants’ unmet healthcare needs by developing emerging technologies. However, there is limited understanding of effective strategies, especially how technologies can effectively be designed to increase providers’ understanding of working with socially marginalized communities and their motivations to enhance practices. The goal of our larger study is to examine different perspectives on the immigrant community’s health management and identify design implications for improved access to care for marginalized communities. As an initial step, we discuss findings from interviews with 15 healthcare providers working in underserved community settings and explore future directions. This study presents design implications for better assisting healthcare providers to achieve improved motivation for working with underserved populations, thereby facilitating patient care. ",

      "abstract": "Before medical professionals are permitted to operate a medical device, they require appropriate training. The conventional training method, carried out on-site by an expert, has been shown to be deficient for years, posing a risk to healthcare professionals and patients. In contrast, single-user virtual reality (VR) training provides interactive priming of medical devices without the involvement of an expert but with increased training success. As multi-user VR training could offer the benefits of both methods, we investigate its potential for improving medical device training by designing, implementing, and comparing different training methods — 1) conventional training under the guidance of an instructor for a group of people, 2) interactive VR training for single users, and 3) interactive VR training for multiple users with an instructor — we aim to address the existing problem of insufficient medical device training. Although the methods differ in terms of visual representation and interaction, the identical learning content in all methods allows for a valid comparison. Our findings demonstrate that Multi-User VR Training has the potential to be a useful, if not superior, alternative to conventional training.",

      "abstract": "The rapid advancements in generative AI have spurred the development of AI chatbots for emotional support. In this work, we designed ArtTheraCat, a novel multimodal chatbot that promotes mental health by integrating supportive dialogue with artistic image generation. Utilizing images as an auxiliary medium, ArtTheraCat guides users through a process of emotion externalization in multi-turn dialogues, which can facilitates self-awareness, reflection, and positive emotional encouragement. Results from a user study involving 21 participants indicate a significant improvement in their emotional state post-interaction with ArtTheraCat, especially in reducing negative affects. Qualitative analysis highlighted the role of generated images as a non-verbal medium in emotional release and self-insight. The findings of this paper provide practical guidance for the design of multimodal mental health chatbots.",

      "abstract": "People with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) face challenges planning health care collaboratively with primary care clinicians, particularly when their priorities conflict. These challenges intensify with symptoms of anxiety or depression. Elicitation of patients’ values is promoted as a means to aligning patient and clinician priorities in primary care, and as a component of psychotherapy for anxiety and depression. But, these approaches remain siloed. We conducted a qualitative interview study to understand patients’ preferences for Technology Enabled Services (TESs) to coordinate values elicitation across primary and mental health care settings. Many participants preferred face-to-face elicitation by a mental health clinician; some preferred elicitation via telehealth and some preferred self-directed elicitation. Participants’ preferences were influenced by: 1) how they perceived the rationale and benefits of values elicitation; 2) how they perceived the training and credibility of people facilitating elicitation; and 3) how they perceived their own capacity to engage in values elicitation. Participants also shared numerous concerns about values elicitation that warrant critical examination of TESs to support it.",

Moreover, if AI is political and reflects the economic, social, and cultural conditions in which it emerges, a feminist and decolonial AI should address the systemic and structural conditions that make AI, in its current hegemonic form, a tool for reinforcing local and global asymmetries. Drawing from feminist and decolonial epistemologies, we challenge the basic assumptions about how, where, for what, why, and by whom technologies are built. In other words, how to address AI as a matter of power (Ricaurte, 2022b).",

      "abstract": "Computational social science seeks insights into human interactions – online and offline – based on traces of our activity online. But whose online activity do we pay attention to? Researchers are increasingly sensitive to the biases in our work that decenter the Global Majority and can overfocus on use cases in WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic) societies. But we have other biases that need addressing, including a bias towards studying the most popular speech: the video that goes viral, the Twitter quip that shapes headlines.\n\nA fuller understanding of how digital media is shaping our lives requires attention to the quotidian internet, the billions of digital objects created every day, all over the world, most of whom are seen by small audiences of family and friends, or no one at all. Studying the quotidian web is a technical challenge, as well as an ethical one – can we ethically study media that we were never expected to see – but offers a vastly richer picture of what people are making, sharing and encountering around the world. Studying quotidian media can recenter Global Majority uses of digital media, showing how people around the world are reinventing the tools of American and Chinese media monopolies for their own needs.",

      "abstract": "Prior work has explored various technology designs to support intergenerational communications and connections through remote activities such as reading or play. However, few works have explored these technologies outside the family settings. In this work, we aimed to understand how technology can support social connectedness through remote activities, by investigating the use of a tablet-based AR system among older adult volunteers and students for remote reading. We developed the system based on insights from previous research, deployed the system in the field, and observed the use of the system over six months. With the data collected from the field, we present a rich description on the use of the system and the practices that emerged around its usage in a real-world setting. Our findings highlight the importance of supporting an engaging reading experience and context understanding for social connections with the technology design. We provide insights into how such technology can support intergenerational communication and foster social connectedness.",
