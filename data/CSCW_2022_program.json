      "abstract": "Misinformation has developed into a critical societal threat that can lead to disastrous societal consequences. Although fact checking plays a key role in combating misinformation, relatively little research has empirically investigated the work practices of professional fact checkers. To address this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 fact checkers from 19 countries. Fact checkers reported being inundated with information that needs filtering and prioritizing prior to fact checking. The interviews surfaced a pipeline of practices fragmented across disparate tools that lack integration. Importantly, fact checkers lack effective mechanisms for dissemination which prevents their efforts from fully achieving their potential impact. We found that the largely manual and labor intensive nature of current fact-checking practices is a barrier to scale. We apply these findings to propose a number of suggestions that can improve the effectiveness, efficiency, scale, and reach of fact-checking work and its outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Shared practices to assess the diversity of retrieval system results are still debated in the Information Retrieval community, partly because of the challenges of determining what diversity means in specific scenarios, and of understanding how diversity is perceived by end-users. The field of Music Information Retrieval is not exempt from this issue. Even if fields such as Musicology or Sociology of Music have a long tradition in questioning the representation and the impact of diversity in cultural environments, such knowledge has not been yet embedded into the design and development of music technologies. In this paper, focusing on electronic music, we investigate the characteristics of listeners, artists, and tracks that are influential in the perception of diversity. Specifically, we center our attention on 1) understanding the relationship between perceived diversity and computational methods to measure diversity, and 2) analyzing how listeners’ domain knowledge and familiarity influence such perceived diversity. To accomplish this, we design a user-study wherein listeners are asked to compare pairs of lists of tracks and artists, and to select the most diverse list from each pair. We compare participants’ ratings with results obtained through computational models built using audio tracks’ features and artist attributes. We find that such models are generally aligned with participants’ choices when most of them agree that one list is more diverse than the other. In addition, we observe how differences in domain knowledge, familiarity, and demographics influence the level of agreement among listeners, and between listeners and computational diversity metrics.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Detecting anomalies in time-varying multivariate data is crucial in various industries for the predictive maintenance of equipment. Numerous machine learning (ML) algorithms have been proposed to support automated anomaly identification. However, a significant amount of human knowledge is still required to interpret, analyze, and calibrate the results of automated analysis. This paper investigates current practices used to detect and investigate anomalies in time series data in industrial contexts and identifies corresponding needs. Through iterative design and working with nine experts from two industry domains (aerospace and energy), we characterize six design elements required for a successful visualization system that supports effective detection, investigation, and annotation of time series anomalies. We summarize an ideal human-AI collaboration workflow that streamlines the process and supports efficient and collaborative analysis. We introduce MTV (Multivariate Time Series Visualization), a visual analytics system to support such workflow. The system incorporates a set of novel visualization and interaction designs to support multi-faceted time series exploration, efficient in-situ anomaly annotation, and insight communication. Two user studies, one with 6 spacecraft experts (with routine anomaly analysis tasks) and one with 25 general end-users (without such tasks), are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of MTV.",

      "abstract": "Twitter is increasingly important for political outreach and networking around the world. While electoral politics and social relations in India are heavily organized by caste, a broader rhetoric of castelessness among upper-caste politicians has led to the eschewing of caste publicly to appear secular. This has rendered caste dynamics more implicit than explicit. Social media, often cited as a tool for inclusion, offers a unique window into the networks of covert exclusion. Our study analyzes three structural properties of the Twitter network of Members of Parliament in India - influence, bridging capital, and mutual connectivity, to understand how caste manifests as social capital in the information economy. Our results show that those higher in the caste hierarchy are structurally poised for higher social capital through higher influence, incoming bridging capital, and higher propensity for mutual connections with other MPs in the network. Our study offers a methodological window into these invisible relations to show how structural advantages of Brahmanical supremacy are being co-produced and stabilized on social media at the highest level of politics.",

      "abstract": "Technology abuse among adolescents refers to the problematic use of technology devices, and the negative impact it can have on lifestyle and one’s physical and mental health. This paper reports on in-depth interviews with 15 dyads of adolescent patients, their parents, and four experts with the objective of unraveling the issue of technology abuse. We conducted qualitative analysis aimed at unpacking the contextual factors affecting technology abuse, and differences between adolescents and their parents pertaining to this issue. Our discussions led us to formulate solutions to technology abuse: (1) motivating adolescents by sending timely reminders and providing interactive micro-incentives; (2) promoting communication between adolescents and their parents by sharing usage data related to device usage; and (3) incorporating social supports to complement parental support, while fulfilling the adolescent’s social needs. This paper provides valuable insights into the design of technological solutions aimed at mediating technology abuse.",

      "abstract": "Veterans are a unique marginalized group facing multiple vulnerabilities. Current assessments of veteran needs and support largely come from first-person accounts guided by researchers’ prompts. Social media platforms not only enable veterans to connect with each other, but also to self-disclose experiences and seek support. This paper addresses the gap in our understanding of veteran needs and their own support dynamics by examining self-initiated and ecologically-valid self-expressions. In particular, we adopt the Veteran Critical Theory (VCT) to conduct a computational study on the Reddit community of veterans. Using topic modeling, we find veteran-friendly gestures with good intentions might not be appreciated in the subreddit. By employing transfer learning methodologies, we find this community has more informational and emotional support behaviors than general online communities and a higher prevalence of informational support than emotional support. Lastly, an examination of support dynamics reveals some contrasts to previous scholarship in military culture and social media. We discover that positive language and author platform tenure have negative relations with posts receiving replies and replies getting votes, and that replies reflecting personal disclosures tend to get more votes. Through the lens of VCT, we discuss how online communities can help uncover veterans’ needs and provide more effective social support.",

      "abstract": "Challenging behaviors significantly impact learning and socialization of autistic children and can stress and burden their caregivers. Documentation of challenging behaviors is fundamental for identifying what environmental factors influence them, such as how others respond to a child's such behaviors. Caregiver-tracked data on their child’s challenging behaviors can help clinical experts make informed recommendations about how to manage such behaviors. To support caregivers in recording their children’s challenging behaviors, we developed GeniAuti, a mobile-based data-collection tool built upon a clinical data collection form to document challenging behaviors and other clinically relevant contextual information such as place, duration, intensity, and what triggers such behaviors. Through an open-ended deployment with 19 parent--child pairs and three expert collaborators, caregivers found GeniAuti valuable for (1) becoming more attentive and reflective to behavioral contexts, including their own response strategies, (2) discovering positive aspects of their children's behaviors, and (3) promoting collaboration with clinical experts around the caregiver-tracked data to develop tailored intervention strategies for their children. However, participant experiences surface challenges of logging behaviors in social circumstances, conflicting views between caregivers and clinical experts around the structured recording process, and emotional struggles resulting from recording and reflecting on intensely negative experiences. Considering the complex nature of caregiver-based health tracking and caregiver--clinician collaboration, we suggest design opportunities for facilitating negotiations between caregivers and clinicians and accounting for caregivers' emotional needs.",

      "abstract": "In contrast to existing, static audience controls that map poorly onto users’ ideal audiences on social networking sites, dynamic audience selection (DAS) controls can make intelligent inferences to help users’ select their ideal audience given context and content. But does this potential utility outweigh its potential intrusiveness? We surveyed 250 participants to identify model users’ ideal versus their chosen audiences with static controls and found a significant misalignment, suggesting that DAS might provide utility. We then designed a sensitizing prototype that allowed users to select audiences based on personal attributes, content, or context constraints. We evaluated DAS vis-a-vis Facebook’s existing audience selection controls through a counterbalanced summative evaluation. We found that DAS’s expressiveness, customizability, and scalability made participants feel more confident about the content they shared on Facebook. However, low transparency, distrust in algorithmic inferences, and the emergence of privacy-violating side channels made participants find the prototype unreliable or intrusive. We discuss factors that affected this trade-off between DAS’s utility and intrusiveness and synthesize design implications for future audience selection tools.",

      "abstract": "Facebook Reactions are a collection of animated icons that enable users to share and express their emotions when interacting with Facebook content. The current design of Facebook Reactions utilizes visual stimuli (animated graphics and text) to convey affective information, which presents usability and accessibility barriers for Facebook users, particularly those living with visual impairments. In this paper, we investigate the use of sonification as a universally-accessible modality to aid in the conveyance of affect for blind and sighted social media users. We discuss the design and evaluation of 48 sonifications, leveraging Facebook Reactions as a conceptual framework. We conducted an online sound-matching study with 75 participants (11 blind, 64 sighted) to evaluate the performance of these sonifications. We found that sonification is an effective tool for conveying emotion for blind and sighted participants, and we highlight sonification design strategies that contribute to improved efficacy. Finally, we contextualize these findings and discuss the implications of this research with respect to HCI and the accessibility of digital communities and platforms.",

      "abstract": "Harassment has long been considered a severe social issue and a culturally contextualized construct. More recently, understanding and mitigating emerging harassment in social Virtual Reality (VR) has become a growing research area in HCI and CSCW. Based on the perspective of harassment in the U.S. culture, in this paper we identify new characteristics of online harassment in social VR using 30 in-depth interviews. We especially attend to how people who are already considered marginalized in the gaming and virtual worlds contexts (e.g., women, LGBTQ, and ethnic minorities) experience such harassment. As social VR is still a novel technology, our proactive approach highlights embodied harassment as an emerging but understudied form of harassment in novel online social spaces. Our critical review of social VR users’ experiences of harassment and recommendations to mitigate such harassment also extends the current conceptualization of online harassment in CSCW. We therefore contribute to the active prevention of future harassment in nuanced online environments, platforms, and experiences.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, our online interactions are constantly mediated through Artificial Intelligence (AI), including our social interactions. AI-mediated social interaction is the AI-facilitated process of building and maintaining social connections between individuals through information inferred from people's online posts. With its impending application across a wide range of contexts, the challenges and opportunities of AI-mediated social interaction remain underexplored. This paper seeks to understand the design space of AI-mediated social interaction in the context of online learning, where online learners frequently experience social isolation. We deployed an AI agent named SAMI in three online class discussion forums to help online learners build social connections. Using SAMI as a probe, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 online learners to elicit design feedback by understanding their difficulties in remote social interactions and their experiences with SAMI. Through the lenses of social translucence and social-technical gap, we illustrate online learners' difficulties in remote social interactions and how SAMI resolved some of the difficulties. We also identify potential ethical and social challenges of SAMI such as user agency and privacy. Based on our findings, we outline the design space of AI-mediated social interaction. We discuss the design tension between AI performance and ethical design and pinpoint two design opportunities for AI-mediated social interaction in designing towards human-AI collaborative social matching and artificial serendipity.",

      "abstract": "Code review consists of manual inspection, discussion, and judgment of source code by developers other than the code’s author. Due to discussions around competing ideas and group decision-making processes, interpersonal conflicts during code reviews are expected. This study systematically investigates how developers perceive code review conflicts and addresses interpersonal conflicts during code reviews as a theoretical construct. Through the thematic analysis of interviews conducted with 22 developers, we confirm that conflicts during code reviews are commonplace, anticipated and seen as normal by developers. Even though conflicts do happen and carry a negative impact for the review, conflicts—if resolved constructively—can also create value and bring improvement. Moreover, the analysis provided insights on how strongly conflicts during code review and its context (i.e., code, developer, team, organization) are intertwined. Finally, there are aspects specific to code review conflicts that call for the research and application of customized conflict resolution and management techniques, some of which are discussed in this paper.",

In this paper, we fill this gap by eliciting a catalog of best practices for collaborative data science with computational notebooks. With this aim, we first look for best practices through a multivocal literature review. Then, we conduct interviews with professional data scientists to assess their awareness of these best practices. Finally, we assess the adoption of best practices through the analysis of 1,380 Jupyter notebooks retrieved from the Kaggle platform. Findings reveal that experts are mostly aware of the best practices and tend to adopt them in their daily work. Nonetheless, they do not consistently follow all the recommendations as, depending on specific contexts, some are deemed unfeasible or counterproductive due to the lack of proper tool support. As such, we envision the design of notebook solutions that allow data scientists not to have to prioritize exploration and rapid prototyping over writing code of quality.",

      "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of previously collocated information workers had to work from home, a trend expected to become much more commonplace in the future. We interviewed 53 information workers from 17 U.S. teams to understand how this unique extended work-from-home setting influenced teamwork and how they adapted to it. Using a grounded theory approach, we discovered that extended remote work highlighted diversity in team members’ home-lives and daily work rhythms.  Whereas these types of diversity played only marginal roles for teams in the collocated office, they had a more tangible impact in the work-from-home setting, from coordination delays and interruptions to conflicts related to workload fairness, miscommunication, and trust. Importantly, workers reported that their teams adapted to these challenges by setting explicit norms and standards for online communication and asynchronous collaboration and by promoting general social and situational awareness. We discuss computer-supported designs to help teams manage these latent diversities in an extended remote teamwork setting.",

      "abstract": "An immersive virtual laboratory (VL) could offer flexibility of time and space, as well as safety, for remote students to conduct laboratory activities through online experiential learning. Recording an instructor’s demonstration inside a VL is an approach that allows students to learn directly from a demonstration. However, students have to learn from a recording while controlling the playback, which requires additional spatial and temporal attention. This additional attention load could lead to mistakes in following laboratory procedures. We have identified four design requirements to reduce attention load in VLs; namely, organized learning steps, improved student sense of co-presence, reduction of task-instructor split-attention, and learning independent of interpersonal distance. Based on these requirements, we have designed and implemented spatial-temporal assistive toolsets for laboratories in virtual environment, namely XR-LIVE, that reduces mental load and enhance effective learning in an asynchronous shared-space demonstration, implemented based on the setup of a standard civil engineering laboratory. We also analyzed students’ behavior in the VL demonstration to design guidelines applicable to generic VLs.",

      "abstract": "The growth of technologies promising to infer emotions raises political and ethical concerns, including concerns regarding their accuracy and transparency. A marginalized perspective in these conversations is that of data subjects potentially affected by emotion recognition. Taking social media as one emotion recognition deployment context, we conducted interviews with data subjects (i.e., social media users) to investigate their notions about accuracy and transparency in emotion recognition and interrogate stated attitudes towards these notions and related folk theories. We find that data subjects see accurate inferences as uncomfortable and as threatening their agency, pointing to privacy and ambiguity as desired design principles for social media platforms. While some participants argued that contemporary emotion recognition must be accurate, others raised concerns about possibilities for contesting the technology and called for better transparency. Furthermore, some challenged the technology altogether, highlighting that emotions are complex, relational, performative, and situated. In interpreting our findings, we identify new folk theories about accuracy and meaningful transparency in emotion recognition. Overall, our analysis shows an unsatisfactory status quo for data subjects that is shaped by power imbalances and a lack of reflexivity and democratic deliberation within platform governance.",

      "abstract": "Digital tools can support individuals managing mental health concerns, but delivering sufficiently engaging content is challenging. This paper seeks to clarify how individuals with mental health concerns can contribute content to improve push-based mental health messaging tools. We recruited crowdworkers with mental health symptoms to evaluate and revise expert-composed content for an automated messaging tool, and to generate new topics and messages. A second wave of crowdworkers evaluated expert and crowdsourced content. Crowdworkers generated topics for messages that had not been prioritized by experts, including self-care, positive thinking, inspiration, relaxation, and reassurance. Peer evaluators rated messages written by experts and peers similarly. Our findings also suggest the importance of personalization, particularly when content adaptation occurs over time as users interact with example messages. These findings demonstrate the potential of crowdsourcing for generating diverse and engaging content for push-based tools, and suggest the need to support users in meaningful content customization.",

      "abstract": "Building from sociotechnical studies of disinformation and of information infrastructures, we examine how – over a period of eleven months – Italian QAnon supporters designed and maintained a distributed, multi-layered “infrastructure of disinformation” that spans multiple social media platforms, messaging apps, online forums, alternative media channels, as well as websites, databases, and content aggregators. Examining disinformation from an infrastructural lens reveals how QAnon disinformation operations extend well-beyond the use of social media and the construction of false narratives. While QAnon conspiracy theories continue to evolve and adapt, the overarching (dis)information infrastructure through which \"epistemic evidence\" is constructed and constantly updated is rather stable and has increased in size and complexity over time. Most importantly, we also found that deplatforming is a time-sensitive effort. The longer platforms wait to intervene, the harder it is to eradicate infrastructures as they develop new layers, get distributed across the Internet, and can rely on a critical mass of loyal followers. More research is needed to examine whether the key characteristics of the disinformation infrastructure that we identified extend to other disinformation infrastructures, which might include infrastructures put together by climate change denialists, vaccine skeptics, or voter fraud advocates.",

      "abstract": "Designing computerized approaches to support complex teamwork requires an understanding of how activity-related information is relayed among team members. In this paper, we focus on verbal communication and describe a speech-based model that we developed for tracking activity progression during time-critical teamwork. We situated our study in the emergency medical domain of trauma resuscitation and transcribed speech from 104 audio recordings of actual resuscitations. Using the transcripts, we first studied the nature of speech during 34 clinically relevant activities. From this analysis, we identified 11 communicative events across three different stages of activity performance—before, during, and after. For each activity, we created sequential ordering of the communicative events using the concept of narrative schemas. The final speech-based model emerged by extracting and aggregating generalized aspects of the 34 schemas. We evaluated the model performance by using 17 new transcripts and found that the model reliably recognized an activity stage in 98% of activity-related conversation instances. We conclude by discussing these results, their implications for designing computerized approaches that support complex teamwork, and their generalizability to other safety-critical domains.",

      "abstract": "Determining who is responsible for online misinformation is an important problem. This research offers a multi-faceted view of the public's perception of who is responsible for online misinformation. We surveyed how people attribute responsibility separately for creating, disseminating, and failing to prevent false information online via two studies. Study 1 (N=99) employed a mixed-methods approach to identify a series of actors deemed responsible for each aspect of misinformation. Its open-ended methodology suggested a tendency for externalization of responsibility, which we explored further in the subsequent study. Study 2 (N=496) found that the responsible entities differ for the three distinct aspects of misinformation; for instance, people, news media, and interest groups were associated with creating falsehoods, whereas social media platforms were predominantly seen as accountable for failing to prevent them. Our results show that the blame goes towards those on the opposite side of the political spectrum, revealing substantial polarization. Most critically, our study found that participants do not associate themselves with online misinformation and externalize responsibility towards \"other users.\" We discuss implications, including the need for promoting personal accountability among users and the social demand for accountable social media platforms and news media.",

      "abstract": "Analyzing usability test videos is arduous. Although recent research showed the promise of AI in assisting with such tasks, it remains largely unknown how AI should be designed to facilitate effective collaboration between user experience (UX) evaluators and AI. Inspired by the concepts of agency and work context in human and AI collaboration literature, we studied two corresponding design factors for AI-assisted UX evaluation: explanations and synchronization. Explanations allow AI to further inform humans how it identifies UX problems from a usability test session; synchronization refers to the two ways humans and AI collaborate: synchronously and asynchronously. We iteratively designed a tool—AI Assistant—with four versions of UIs corresponding to the two levels of explanations (with/without) and synchronization (sync/async). By adopting a hybrid wizard-of-oz approach to simulating an AI with reasonable performance, we conducted a mixed-method study with 24 UX evaluators identifying UX problems from usability test videos using AI Assistant. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that AI with explanations, regardless of being presented synchronously or asynchronously, provided better support for UX evaluators’ analysis and was perceived more positively;when without explanations, synchronous AI better improved UX evaluators’ performance and engagement compared to the asynchronous AI. Lastly, we present the design implications for AI-assisted UX evaluation and facilitating more effective human-AI collaboration.",

      "abstract": "User experience (UX) research has been criticized for focusing on leisure contexts and overlooking the work contexts. Moreover, researchers have been drawing attention to how UX at work differs from UX in leisure contexts, requiring development of domain specific knowledge. Inspired by these discussions, our motivation is to see the current state of UX at work research. Based on the systematic review of 52 papers, our results revealed that UX at work research is still immature. It is run by dichotomies; the conceptualizations such as the definition and the dimensions of UX at work are ambiguous; the variety of the studied work domains are limited and do not contribute to the understanding of UX at work; and the consideration of contextual factors are arbitrary and coincidental. To advance this important field of research, we indicate the research gaps and suggest a research agenda introducing areas for future research.",

      "abstract": "The Historic Westside Universities Alliance Data Dashboard was created to meet the data equity needs of a group of resource-constrained communities in the Westside neighborhoods of Atlanta. We observed the development of this dashboard by participating as ethnographers and developers of its public safety module. Our ethnography and subsequent situational analysis of the dashboard’s infrastructuring process led us to the work that individual stakeholders do in bringing such a dashboard to fruition. These stakeholders, whom we call infrastructural bricoleurs, operate through principles of situated knowledge, partial perspectives, limited power, and located accountability. Our analysis, which builds on concepts of infrastructures, bricolage, and feminist principles of technology design, helps us add further specificity to the work that infrastructural bricoleurs need to do when building civic data dashboards with resource constrained communities. Our findings benefit other researchers studying data infrastructures as well as administrators and practitioners within programs like DSSG (Data Science for Social Good) who are interested in building data infrastructures under similar constraints.

      "abstract": "Social media platforms like Facebook have become increasingly popular for serving targeted ads to their users. This has led to increased privacy concerns due to the lack of transparency regarding how ads are matched against each user profile. Facebook infers user interests through their activities and targets ads based on those interests. Although Facebook provides explanations for why a particular interest is inferred about a user, there is still a gap in understanding what activities lead to interest inferences and the extent to which the sentiment or context of activities is considered in inferring interests.\r\n\r\nTo obtain insights into how Facebook generates interests from a user’s Facebook activities, we performed controlled experiments by creating new accounts and systematically executing numerous planned activities. This enabled us to make causal inferences about activities that lead to generating specific interests, many of which were not representative of actual user preferences. We also evaluated which activities resulted in interests and found that very naive activities, such as only viewing/scrolling through a page, leads to an interest inference. We found 33.22% of the inferred interests were inaccurate or irrelevant. We further evaluated the interest inference explanations provided by Facebook and found that these explanations were too generalized and, at times, misleading. To understand if our findings hold for a large and diverse sample, we conducted a user study where we recruited 146 participants (through Amazon Mechanical Turk) from different regions of the world to evaluate the accuracy of interests inferred by Facebook. We developed a browser extension to extract data from their own Facebook accounts and ask questions based on such data. Our participants reported a similar range (29%) of inaccuracy as observed in our controlled experiments. We also found that most of our participants were unaware of the availability of Facebook’s ad preference manager, interest inference process, and even interest explanations.",

      "abstract": "Recent participatory practices and value-sensitive algorithm design contributed to building algorithmic sociotechnical systems that align with a community’s values and needs. However, there is still little understanding around possible conflicts between stakeholders when defining values in the early stages of algorithm design as well as the power dynamics that arise when using and maintaining an algorithmic socio-technical system over time. In this paper, we study the power dynamics and conflicts around one of our community's algorithmic sociotechnical systems, the SIGCHI student volunteer (SV) selection system, which uses a weighted semi-randomized algorithm to recruit a desired pool of volunteers. Interviews with 24 community members with various roles showed that the SV selection process, although seemingly algorithmic, is a complex sociotechnical process in which the algorithm's outputs are interpreted and adjusted by the conference organizers in order to reflect the values of the community while ensuring that the group of selected volunteers can aptly help organize the conference. Such a sociotechnical process, in turn, provided a stage in which the existing power hierarchy and value conflicts among the stakeholders played salient roles in determining how the process was perceived and envisioned. For instance, our participants found the algorithm used in the SV selection process to be a power-balancer that places a check on the organizers who oversee the process. However, when we engaged participants in a participation practice to design the algorithm,  prevalent value conflicts between participants resulted in a failure in capturing a clear consensus about what values the SV selection process should prioritize, or even what should be considered a value in the first place. Participants suggested that a potential solution might be value transparency---the type of transparency that focuses on explaining why a decision was made over how it was made---as a mechanism for resolving such conflicts. Based on our findings, we lay out recommendations that communities can adopt to design and sustain algorithmic systems over time, especially in the face of power issues and conflicts.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Wilderness search and rescue (WSAR) is a command-and-control activity, where a Command team manages field teams scattered across a large area looking for a lost person. The challenge is that it can be difficult for Command to maintain awareness of field teams and the conditions of the field. We designed RescueCASTR, an interface that explores the idea of deploying field teams with wearable cameras that stream live video or sequential photos periodically to Command that aid contextual awareness. We ran a remote user study with WSAR managers to get an understanding of the opportunities and challenges of such a system. We found that the awareness provided by the camera footage could give additional confidence and comfort to Command, as well as reduce the need for explicit communications. However, it could also impact workers’ traditional roles and responsibilities, shifting the burden of responsibility toward Command. We conclude that, while wearable-camera footage could be beneficial to Command, they need to have the tools and means to narrow their focus within the abundance of information provided. Furthermore, camera streams should not be thought of as a replacement for more direct communications, but rather as another tool available to help Command supplement their understanding of events in the field and help them narrow their focus.",

      "abstract": "Significant research has examined social media users' self-presentation strategies, both within a single account and across multiple platforms. Few studies, however, have considered how users' self-presentation varies across multiple accounts on a single platform. In this survey study, we examine how Instagram users manage content sharing decisions and the audience for their content across two types of Instagram accounts: Rinsta (\"real\" Instagram) and Finsta (\"fake\" Instagram). Data analyzed includes 499 Finsta and Rinsta posts rated across different dimensions of self-presentation (e.g., self-presentation intention, picture editing effort) and 453 open-ended responses about participants' rationales for using the two accounts. Through this mixed-method approach, we find that Rinsta accounts are more likely to be public, focus on positive and uplifting content, and involve more careful editing and selection, while Finsta accounts are used for more off-the-cuff, emotional, and inappropriate content, as well as those photos that do not make the Rinsta cut. Participants also rated how they perceived responses to their Finsta and Rinsta posts. Mediation analysis suggests that participants perceived responses to Finsta posts as less satisfying, useful, and supportive - partly because Finsta posts contained more negative emotions and received fewer comments than Rinsta posts. We discuss these findings in relation to prior work on social media, self-presentation, and platform affordances, and consider the benefits of this more time-intensive approach to managing two distinct personas on one platform.",

This paper is based on qualitative, ethnographic fieldwork with matchmakers working with middle-class, upper-caste Hindu and Parsi communities in metropolitan India and offering services alongside, or as an alternative to the now widely used online matrimonial services. Through our fieldwork, we found all matchmakers\r\nengaged with digital technologies’ involvement in the ongoing churn around modern choice. Matchmakers engaged with this wider social discourse through ideas of trust, autonomy and genealogy and in doing so they responded to and re/produced varying\r\nimaginations of the future of families, community, individuals. Our findings contribute to an understanding of the digitisation of a service as well as make a case for widening the conceptual scope of the future of work debate currently dominated by economistic\r\nconceptions of work. By paying attention to the links between the productive and reproductive spheres of life, we follow labor and capital into the families and communities they reside in order to see the variety of moral projects capital can be invested in.",

      "abstract": "\"Fishing\" is a particular form of non-literal communication on the Chinese Internet that tries to lure or bait others. We conducted a case study of fishing on a Chinese Q&A platform using a CDA-informed analytical method to deconstruct the linguistic structure of fishing language and identify its features. Further, we examined the influence of fishing language on the underlying communication environment. We found that fishing is a direct reaction to the rigid norms of politeness and friendliness imposed on users by platform owners. Our analysis reveals the role of fishing for autonomous and active negotiation of boundaries and linguistic norms for online discussion of controversial topics, demonstrating that fishing is organically connected with other social communication within the community. The findings challenge the typical characterization of non-literal communication in research and applications involving text mining and platform regulation that tends to see non-literal communication as abnormal and contribute a more refined understanding of online linguistic norms, community cohesion, and civil engagement.",

      "abstract": "Many types of online communities rely on volunteer moderators to manage the community and maintain behavioral standards. While prior work has shown that community moderators often develop a deep understanding of the goals of their moderation context and sophisticated processes for managing disruptions, less is known about the processes through which moderators develop this knowledge. In this paper, we leverage Schon's concept of reflective practice as a lens for exploring how community moderators develop the `knowledge-in-action' that they use to perform their work. Drawing on interviews with 18 Twitch moderators, we conceptualize moderators as reflective practitioners, iteratively encountering novel situations and adjusting their practices and mental models. Our findings provide detailed insight into how community moderators reflect-in-action, re-evaluating in real-time their mental models of viewer intent and community goals, and reflect-on-action, conducting post hoc assessments of individual incidents and long-term changes to adjust their practice over time. Moderators working in teams reveal specific aspects of reflection facilitated by cooperative discussion, which we call `groupwise reflective practice'. By identifying community moderation as a form of reflective practice, we can leverage insights gained from studying practitioners in other fields, providing theoretical and practical implications for the study and support of community moderation.",

However, patients’ data tracking does not automatically lead to data sharing and discussion with clinicians, which can make it difficult to utilize and derive optimal benefit from PGD. In this paper, we investigate whether and how patients share their PGD with clinicians and the types of challenges that arise within this context. We describe patients’ immediate experiences of PGD sharing with clinicians, based on our short onsite interviews with 57 patients who had just met with a clinician at a university health center. Our analyses identified overarching patterns in patients’ PGD sharing practices and the associated challenges that arise from the information asymmetry between patients and clinicians and from patients’ reliance on their memory to share their PGD. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing PGD-integrated health IT systems in ways to support patients’ tracking of relevant PGD, clinicians’ effective engagement with patients around PGD, and the efficient sharing and review of PGD within clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "Instagram infographics are a digital activism tool that have redefined action frames for technology-facilitated social movements. From the 1960s through the 1980s, United States ethnic movements practiced collective action: ideologically unified, resource-intensive traditional activism. Today, technologically enabled movements have been categorized as practicing connective action: individualized, low-resource online activism. Yet, we argue that Instagram infographics are both connective and collective. This paper juxtaposes the insights of past and present U.S. ethnic movement activists and analyzes Black Lives Matter Instagram data over the course of 7 years (2014-2020). We find that Instagram infographic activism bridges connective and collective action in three ways: (1) Scope for Education: Visually enticing and digestible infographics reduce the friction of information dissemination, facilitating collective movement education while preserving customizability. (2) Reconciliation for Credibility: Activists use connective features to combat infographic misinformation and resolve internal differences, creating a trusted collective movement front. (3) High-Resource Efforts for Transformative Change: Instagram infographic activism has been paired with boots on the ground and action-oriented content, curating a connective-to-collective pipeline that expends movement resources. Our work unveils the vitality of evaluating digital activism action frames at the movement integration level, exemplifies the powerful coexistence of connective and collective action, and offers design implications for activists seeking to leverage this novel tool.",

      "abstract": "Where do the most popular online cultural artifacts such as image memes originate? Media narratives suggest that cultural innovations often originate in peripheral communities and then diffuse to the mainstream core; behavioral science suggests that intermediate network positions that bridge between the periphery and the core are especially likely to originate many influential cultural innovations. Research has yet to fully adjudicate between these predictions because prior work focuses on individual platforms such as Twitter; however, any single platform is only a small, incomplete part of the larger online cultural ecosystem. In this paper, we perform the first analysis of the origins and diffusion of image memes at web scale, via a one-month crawl of all indexible online communities that principally share meme images with English text overlays. Our results suggest that communities at the core of the network originate the most highly diffused image memes: the top 10% of communities by network centrality originate the memes that generate 62% of the image meme diffusion events on the web. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression confirms that memes from core communities are more likely to diffuse than those from peripheral communities even when controlling for community size and activity level. However, a replication analysis that follows the traditional approach of testing the same question only within a single large community, Reddit, finds the regression coefficients reversed---underscoring the importance of engaging in web-scale, cross-community analyses. The ecosystem-level viewpoint of this work positions the web as a highly centralized generator of cultural artifacts such as image memes.",

      "abstract": "The video game Animal Crossing: New Horizons (AC:NH) launched during the COVID-19 pandemic and families turned to it as a game to play together during isolation. This interview study of 27 families considered how families used AC:NH for Joint Media Engagement (JME), where family members engage with media content together, interacting with each other and bringing additional meaning to the experience. We find that the design of AC:NH well facilitates Takeuchi and Stevens’s six conditions for productive JME. Furthermore, we identify and discuss additional conditions that contribute to productive JME: variety and flexibility in play styles that amplify mutual engagement, support for disentrained play that enables new forms of “joint” engagement, and scaffolding for affective interactions. This is followed by an exploration of how the COVID-19 pandemic affected JME. We conclude with design implications for building games to support productive JME for families through design for persistent shared spaces, flexible in-game progress, and social life simulation.",

      "abstract": "Scholars, journalists, and other commentators argue that many parts of the world, including the US, are suffering a social-epistemological crisis, sometimes called \"post-truth\", and that this crisis is related to the fragmentation of newsmedia. The conventional media effects research explanation for this relationship between news and ``post-truth'' is framed in terms of messages and information---especially misinformation---as the mechanism by which media effect change. Analysing the results of a large (n = 164) interview study on mobile and other digital news audiencehood, this article presents an alternative, complementary explanation focused on ritual functions of communication. The primary method of affinity analysis of interview data identified a number of recurring themes: people's preferences, methods, and patterns of news consumption exhibit wild diversity beyond easy summary, but they share the experience of news as nearly ubiquitous, and often as excessive and therefore in need of some management. Strategies for managing news broadly fell into categories of news avoidance and active research. Perhaps the most consistent observation across participants' accounts, however, is a conspicuous absence of other people, with news managed and confronted alone. Those findings are interpreted through James Carey's ritual theory of communication, which argues that meaning emerges not only through transmission of messages and information, but also through people's shared experiences of participating in the ritual processes of communication. This work makes a parallel argument that media fragmentation has been implicated in social-epistemological breakdown not only through the mechanism of messages and (mis)information, but also through the transformation and, in certain cases, loss of shared news rituals ``whereby reality is produced, maintained, repaired, and transformed'' (p.19 [23]). The combination of large-scale interview research with media ritual analysis led to these insights about the cultural relevance and collective implications of people's experiences of ubiquitous news and the avoidance thereof.

      "abstract": "While research continues to investigate and improve the accuracy, fairness, and normative appropriateness of content moderation processes on large social media platforms, even the best process cannot be effective if users reject its authority as illegitimate. We present a survey experiment comparing the perceived institutional legitimacy of four popular content moderation processes. We conducted a within-subjects experiment in which we showed US Facebook users moderation decisions and randomized the description of whether those decisions were made by paid contractors, algorithms, expert panels, or juries of users. Prior work suggests that juries will have the highest perceived legitimacy due to the benefits of judicial independence and democratic representation. However, expert panels had greater perceived legitimacy than algorithms or juries. Moreover, outcome alignment—agreement with the decision—played a larger role than process in determining perceived legitimacy. These results suggest benefits to incorporating expert oversight in content moderation and underscore that any process will face legitimacy challenges derived from disagreement about outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Despite the long history of studying instant messaging usage, we know very little about how today's people participate in group chat channels and interact with others inside a real-world organization. In this short paper, we aim to update the existing knowledge on how group chat is used in the context of today's organizations. The knowledge is particularly important for the new norm of remote works under the COVID-19 pandemic. We have the privilege of collecting two valuable datasets: a total of 4,300 group chat channels in Slack from an R&D department in a multinational IT company; and a total of 117 groups' performance data. Through qualitative coding of 100 randomly sampled group channels from the 4,300 channels dataset, we identified and reported 9 categories such as Project channels, IT-Support channels, and Event channels. We further defined a feature metric with 21 meta features (and their derived features) without looking at the message content to depict the group communication style for these group chat channels, with which we successfully trained a  machine learning model that can automatically classify a given group channel into one of the 9 categories. \r\nIn addition to the descriptive data analysis, we illustrated how these communication metrics can be used to analyze team performance. \r\nWe cross-referenced 117 project teams and their team-based Slack channels and identified 57 teams that appeared in both datasets, then we built a regression model to reveal the relationship between these group communication styles and the project team performance.",

      "abstract": "Historically, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D) researchers in the Global South have advocated for a community-based approach to technology design and development. However, even with this “bottom-up” emphasis, the sustainability and scalability of the resulting innovations remain major challenges, and are poorly understood. To address this gap, we take the case of Bangladesh as a typical Global South context in which development work is carried out by a complex intertwined network of stakeholders across governments, NGOs, donors, and industries. To better understand the current development landscape and its priorities for digital technologies, we conducted interviews with 14 influential decision-makers in Bangladesh who play significant roles in the development of nutrition strategies. Our findings highlight a disconnect between the Bangladesh government's ``digital mandate'' and the reality of digital innovation practice within the nutrition development sector. Our paper contributes to the debate on factors that affect decision-making processes. We explore the dynamics of diverse actors and institutions who are intended to participate in, but can act as obstacles to sustained bottom-up innovations. \r\nOur findings expand understanding of institutional priorities, the dynamics of intermediaries, techno-solutionism, postcolonialism, bureaucracy, competition, and other important topics in CSCW scholarship. We suggest understanding the factors that guide the decision-making process of digital innovation practices in terms of four dimensions: internal, external, vertical, and horizontal. Consequently, we recommend CSCW and HCI researchers become mediators to connect decision-makers and communities and bring their voices in ICT innovations for global development. Finally, we offer recommendations for proactive engagement with decision-making stakeholders, enabling researchers to design community-centered sustainable digital innovations for development.",

However, there lack explorations of practices, challenges, and perceptions of online video captions from the perspectives of both individual content creators and DHH audiences. In this work, we first explore DHH audiences' feedback on and reactions to YouTube video captions through interviews with 13 DHH individuals, and uncover DHH audiences' experiences, challenges, and perceptions on watching videos created by individual content creators (e.g., manually added caption tags could create additional confidence and trust in caption qualities for DHH audiences). We then discover individual content creators' practices, challenges, and perceptions on captioning their videos (e.g., back-captioning problems) by conducting a YouTube video analysis with 189 captioning-related YouTube videos, followed by a survey with 62 individual content creators. Overall, our findings provide an in-depth understanding of captions generated by individual content creators and bridge the knowledge gap mutually between content creators and DHH audiences on captions.",

      "abstract": "Structured data peer production (SDPP) platforms like Wikidata play an important role in knowledge production. Compared to traditional peer production platforms like Wikipedia, Wikidata data is more structured and intended to be used by machines, not (directly) by people; end-user interactions with Wikidata often happen through intermediary \"invisible machines.\" Given this distinction, we wanted to understand Wikidata contributor motivations and how they are affected by usage invisibility caused by the machine intermediaries. Through an inductive thematic analysis of 15 interviews, we find that: (i) Wikidata editors take on two archetypes based on characteristics across multiple dimensions; (ii) the structured nature of Wikidata reveals novel editor motivations; (iii) most Wikidata editors have little understanding of how their contributions are used, which may demotivate some. We synthesize these insights to help guide the future design of SDPP platforms in supporting the engagement of different types of editors.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic greatly changed many people’s daily life. Because of the temporary closure of gym and fitness centers, many people started to take group fitness classes online. The abrupt transition to synchronous online exercise brought lots of uncertainty and challenges to fitness instructors and participants. This study aims to understand how people teach and participate in live stream group fitness classes, the challenges they have encountered, and their practices to address these challenges. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 instructors and 14 participants who had experience teaching or taking live stream group fitness classes on Zoom during the pandemic. Our interviews showed that instructors saw teaching online as a new, more cognitively demanding experience than teaching in-person classes; they found limited resources to create a professional workout space, experienced stress and anxiety, had limited information and approaches to give participants feedback, and faced difficulties with rapport building. Participants found it hard to give real-time reactions while exercising far away from their laptops; they receive less customized instructions, and have difficulty engaging in private chats. Despite the challenges, we envision CMC in exercise is an opportunity for new design and interactions. We propose design recommendations, including using smartwatches to give real-time reactions and smart garment to generate tactile feedback. Health and biometric data can be shared with instructors and other participants during exercise for safety and to create social connections. ",

      "abstract": "Depression is a challenging condition that requires individuals to manage their moods and emotions over time. Within CSCW, there has been an interest in understanding how individuals seek and share support on social media and in online communities. However, less attention has been paid to how collaboration as an aspect of self-management of depression unfolds in people’s daily lives. In this paper, we explore the collaborative self-management work of 28 individuals managing depression who live in the United States. Data collection included remote semi-structured interviews with an associated cognitive mapping exercise. Our findings describe who participants turn to for day-to-day collaborative support, how collaborative activities are enacted (across both ‘mood-focused’ and ‘preventative’ support practices), and where these often technology-mediated interactions occur across text, phone, video, and picture-based channels. We discuss collaborative self-management in the depression support context, including key characteristics: agency, reciprocity, time, and interaction. We also present a four-step model of how the process occurs over time. We conclude by discussing how technology ecosystems support individuals’ collaborative self-management.",

      "abstract": "In this work we explore confidence elicitation methods for crowdsourcing “soft” labels, e.g., probability estimates, to reduce the annotation costs for domains with ambiguous data. Machine learning research has shown that such “soft” labels are more informative and can reduce the data requirements when training supervised machine learning models. By reducing the number of required labels, we can reduce the costs of slow annotation processes such as audio annotation. In our experiments we evaluated three confidence elicitation methods: 1) “No Confidence” elicitation, 2) “Simple Confidence” elicitation, and 3) “Betting” mechanism for confidence elicitation, at both individual (i.e., per participant) and aggregate (i.e., crowd) levels. In addition, we evaluated the interaction between confidence elicitation methods, annotation types (binary, probability, and z-score derived probability), and “soft” versus “hard” (i.e., binarized) aggregate labels. Our results show that both confidence elicitation mechanisms result in higher annotation quality than the “No Confidence” mechanism for binary annotations at both participant and recording levels. In addition, when aggregating labels at the recording level, results indicate that we can achieve comparable results to those with 10-participant aggregate annotations using fewer annotators if we aggregate “soft” labels instead of “hard” labels. These results suggest that for binary audio annotation using a confidence elicitation mechanism and aggregating continuous labels we can obtain higher annotation quality, more informative labels, with quality differences more pronounced with fewer participants. Finally, we propose a way of integrating these confidence elicitation methods into a two-stage, multi-label annotation pipeline.",

      "abstract": "Celebrity influencers are increasingly central to political discourse as they engage in, and get engaged with, on matters of electoral importance. In this paper, using Twitter data from 1432 sportspersons and entertainers and their engagement with the 1000 of the most followed ruling party and opposition politicians from India, we propose a new method to measure partisanship of celebrities along different modes of engagement. Our examination of polarization shows patterns related to both party incumbency and the level of internal organization. We find that the ruling BJP has been more effective than the opposition, the INC, in organized outreach to celebrities, by eschewing explicit party-based partisanship, and instead employing patriotism as a narrative technique. We find that while entertainers are equally engaged by both the ruling and opposition parties, sportspersons, who often enjoy a nationalist appeal by virtue of representing the country, tend to have a much more partisan relationship with the incumbent party.",

      "abstract": "Writing is the currency of academia. Although technology-mediated writing has been studied extensively in CSCW, we know little about how writing practices unfold with disabled people, such as dyslexic writers whose neurodivergence shapes how they process language. Our qualitative analysis reveals how dyslexic professionals simultaneously identify how editing tools break down on academic language; develop workarounds that re-appropriate other tools as language sources; cultivate ad-hoc collaborations to compensate for technology's limitations; and navigate culturally ingrained ableist expectations for writing. We discuss how dyslexic writers' experiences with shouldering invisible work to participate in academic writing processes indicates that current tools and services do not support their needs. We then draw on our findings to inform design opportunities to make writing processes more accessible through changes to writing tools, institutional services, and peer review practices.",

They have seen some investigation in the context of games, but despite their prevalence in non-game software applications, their nature within this context is less clear. We perform a qualitative, investigative analysis of Easter eggs in non-game software application contexts, using primarily archival research including discussion forums, social media posts, and user-created online databases, along with select developer interviews. Our work uncovers the stories behind, motivations for creating, and intended perceptions of Easter eggs, which we present as categories of purposes with illustrative examples. This analysis also informs a categorization and discussion of processes that Easter eggs undergo concerning the social and emotional circumstances of their developers and users. Finally, we use our results to motivate future directions for applying Easter eggs in user interfaces.",

      "abstract": "People with disabilities in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) have limited access to digital assistive technologies (ATs). Most ATs in LMICs are manufactured elsewhere and are expensive and difficult to maintain. Do-It-Yourself Assistive Technologies (DIY-ATs) designed, customized, and repaired by non-technical users offer exciting directions in these contexts. We have been exploring the possibilities and challenges of DIY-ATs in Western Kenya for the past three years, where we used a DIY-AT prototyping platform in community-engaged workshops at rural and urban special education schools. In this paper, we present findings from a concluding-stage research activity: a focus group in which stakeholders, including teachers, disability advocates, and representatives from the local government and technology innovation hubs, discussed the possibilities and challenges of addressing disability issues through DIY-ATs in this context. Participants identified opportunities for homegrown DIY-ATs for social inclusion, disability assessment, and inclusive education. They also shared concerns about the sustainability, safety, and contextual relevance of future ATs.  ",

      "abstract": "Global teams frequently consist of language-based subgroups who put together complementary information and knowledge to achieve common goals. Previous research outlines a two-step work communication flow in these teams. There are team meetings using a required common language (e.g., English); in preparation for those meetings, people have subgroup conversations in their native languages. Work communication at team meetings is often less effective than in subgroup conversations. In the current study, we investigate the idea of leveraging machine translation (MT) to facilitate global team meetings. We hypothesize that exchanging logs of subgroup conversation logs before a team meeting offers contextual information that benefits teamwork at the meeting. MT can translate these logs, which enables comprehension at a low cost. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a between-subjects experiment where twenty quartets of participants performed a personnel selection task. Each quartet included two English native speakers (NS) and two non-native speakers (NNS) whose native language was Mandarin. All participants began the task with subgroup conversations in their native languages, then proceeded to team meetings in English. We manipulated the exchange of conversation logs prior to team meetings: with MT-mediated exchanges versus without. Analysis of participants’ subjective experience, task performance, and depth of discussions as reflected through their conversational moves jointly indicates that team meeting quality improved when there were MT-mediated exchanges of subgroup conversation logs as opposed to no exchanges. We conclude with reflections on when and how MT could be applied to enhance global teamwork across a language barrier.",

To that end, we give ordinary people pattern-based planning tools to help them redesign (and repair) urban areas. We describe a prototype for such a tool that leverages classic patterns to enable city planning by residents, and show through a series of Mechanical Turk experiments that this prototype allows ordinary people to create designs and communicate their intentions without design training or expert intervention.",

      "abstract": "Online freelance platforms can transform knowledge work. However, `gigification’ also presents challenges, including how freelance workers can access and work with knowledge, which prior research has not examined. Through a qualitative interview study, we identify disparities in the ways that freelancers who work for enterprise companies are able to utilize knowledge as part of their work, when compared with traditional employees of similar organizations. We examine how 38 knowledge workers (21 freelancers, 17 employees) deploy knowledge, work skillfully and mobilize resources to meet knowledge needs. We find that both employees and freelancers understand their own ability to act knowledgeably as a dynamic, collaborative, negotiated and emergent accomplishment. However, for freelancers, the dynamic dimensions of knowledge work - such as helping others see the meaning and value of their work, and creating ties between their work and the enterprise - are only minimally-legitimized and minimally-supported by organizing structures and tools. We present our results as `knowledge gaps’, and propose design recommendations to reduce these gaps and consequently make on-demand knowledge work more effective and sustainable.",

      "abstract": "Smart home research has traditionally included visiting participants' homes to build testbed environments and evaluate their experience. However, in-person home deployment poses limitations around scalability and is not a feasible method in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The smart home research community is now facing the need to reshape and innovate research methods and design approaches. This study introduces a scalable smart home platform prototype that demonstrates possible solutions to address issues and limitations posed by the pandemic, such as improving package design, enabling user-driven installation, and facilitating remote evaluation and maintenance. The prototype uses off-the-shelf products with specially designed packaging to ensure interoperability as well as ease of shipping and installation. In this study, the prototype kits were shipped to participants' homes to understand and evaluate user perceptions and experiences around installation and initial use. Responses to a post-installation questionnaire and remote monitoring of system status showed that the participants easily completed their self-installation of the prototype without any on-site support. The study also showed potential for a scenario-based evaluation of the prototype using a remote, contactless research procedure.  ",

      "abstract": "Citizen science project leaders collecting field data in a hyperlocal community often face common socio-technical challenges, which can potentially be addressed by sharing innovations across different groups through peer-to-peer collaboration. However, most citizen science groups practice in isolation, and end up re-inventing the wheel when it comes to addressing these common challenges. This study seeks to investigate distributed collaboration between different water monitoring citizen science groups. We discovered a unique social network application called Water Reporter that mediated distributed collaboration by creating more visibility and transparency between groups using the app. We interviewed 8 citizen science project leaders who were users of this app, and 6 other citizen science project leaders to understand how distributed collaboration mediated by this app differed from collaborative practices of Non Water\r\nReporter users. We found that distributed collaboration was an important goal for both user groups, however, the tasks that support these collaboration activities differed for the two user groups.",

      "abstract": "Parents posting photos and other information about children on social media is increasingly common and a recent source of controversy. We investigated characteristics that predict parental sharing behavior by collecting information from 493 parents of young children in the United States on self-reported demographics, social media activity, parenting styles, children’s social media engagement, and parental sharing attitudes and behaviors. Our findings indicate that most social media active parents share photos of their children online and feel comfortable doing so without their child’s permission. The strongest predictor of parental sharing frequency was general social media posting frequency, suggesting that participants do not strongly differentiate between “regular” photo-sharing activities and parental sharing. Predictors of parental sharing frequency include greater social media engagement, larger social networks with norms encouraging parental sharing, more permissive and confident parenting styles, and greater social media engagement by their children. Contrasting previous research that often highlights benefits of parental sharing, our findings point to a number of risky online behaviors associated with parental sharing not previously uncovered. Implications for children’s privacy and early social media exposure are discussed, including future directions for influencing parental sharing attitudes and behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Wikipedia has been turned into an immensely popular crowd-sourced encyclopedia for information dissemination on numerous versatile topics in the form of subscription free content. It allows anyone to contribute so that the articles remain comprehensive and updated. For enrichment of content without compromising standards, the Wikipedia community enumerates a detailed set of guidelines, which should be followed. Based on these, articles are categorized into several quality classes by the Wikipedia editors with increasing adherence to guidelines. This quality assessment task by editors is laborious as well as demands platform expertise. As a first objective, in this paper, we study evolution of a Wikipedia article with respect to such quality scales. Our results show novel non-intuitive patterns emerging from this exploration. As a second objective we attempt to develop an automated data driven approach for the detection of the early signals influencing the quality change of articles. We posit this as a change point detection problem whereby we represent an article as a time series of consecutive revisions and encode every revision by a set of intuitive features. Finally, various change point detection algorithms are used to efficiently and accurately detect the future change points. We also perform various ablation studies to understand which group of features are most effective in identifying the change points. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that rigorously explores English Wikipedia article quality life cycle from the perspective of quality indicators and provides a novel unsupervised page level approach to detect quality switch, which can help in automatic content monitoring in Wikipedia thus contributing significantly to the CSCW community.",

      "abstract": "Fake news on social media has led to devastating events in parts of the Global South that have seen high emergence of new social media users, who usually lack accurate mental models of digital threats and place high trust in what they access on social media. However, most research on fake news to date focuses on the Western contexts, leaving a paucity of research on the drivers of fake news in low-resource environments, particularly neglecting the viewpoints of social media users in rural regions who lag behind their urban counterparts in digital skills, literacy, and social media adoption. Much remains unknown about how rural and urban social media users differ in their engagement with fake news and how different information sources influence their trust and sharing attitudes. To fill this gap, we conducted a between-subjects design experiment with 478 people in India to investigate how rural and urban residents perceive credible and fake posts, and how different types of sources impact their perceptions of information credibility and sharing behaviors. Our findings reveal that: (1) rural residents were less adept in differentiating between credible and fake posts than urban residents, and (2) source effects on trust and sharing intent manifested differently for urban and rural social media users. For example, fake posts from family members garnered greater trust among urban social media users but were trusted the least by rural social media users. In case of sharing Facebook posts, urban users were more willing to share credible posts from celebrities, whereas, rural users were more inclined to share fake posts from journalists. Drawing on these findings, we propose design interventions to counteract fake news in low-resource environments of the Global South.",

      "abstract": "Several strands of research have aimed to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence (AI) and human decision-makers in AI-assisted decision-making, where humans are the consumers of AI model predictions and the ultimate decision-makers in high-stakes applications. However, people’s perception and understanding are often distorted by their cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, anchoring bias, availability bias, to name a few. In this work, we use knowledge from the field of cognitive science to account for cognitive biases in the human-AI collaborative decision-making setting, and mitigate their negative effects on collaborative performance. To this end, we mathematically model cognitive biases and provide a general framework through which researchers and practitioners can understand the interplay between cognitive biases and human-AI accuracy. We then focus specifically on anchoring bias, a bias commonly encountered in human-AI collaboration. We implement a time-based de-anchoring strategy and conduct our first user experiment that validates its effectiveness in human-AI collaborative decision-making. With this result, we design a time allocation strategy for a resource-constrained setting that achieves optimal human-AI collaboration under some assumptions. We, then, conduct a second user experiment which shows that our time allocation strategy with explanation can effectively de-anchor the human and improve collaborative performance when the AI model has low confidence and is incorrect.",

      "abstract": "Feedback such as rubrics, pre-authored statements, and free-form comments are widely deployed in classrooms and feedback exchange communities. Despite these formats having different levels of detail and requiring different composition processes, little research has related these compositional processes for the provider to the feedback perceptions and revision outcomes for the recipient. In an online experiment, we investigated how novice participants (N=285) revised short stories in response to expert feedback composed with four common processes: rubrics, open comments, rubrics with open comments, and rubrics with comments on each rubric item (per-criterion comments). We also surveyed the feedback providers (N=4) to contrast the costs of composing feedback with the benefits of that feedback for the recipients. We found rubrics with per-criterion comments led to the highest revision quality, providers believed rubrics with open comments were most helpful to recipients, and rubrics alone took the least time to compose. Recipients’ revision quality and perceptions of feedback helpfulness and credibility increased with feedback detail. We contribute an emergent framework for selecting feedback composition techniques based on attributes of interest and insights linking the composition costs with the benefits of the resulting feedback.\r\n",

      "abstract": "We present an ethnographic study of a maker community that conducted safety-driven medical making to deliver over 80,000 devices for use at medical facilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve this, the community had to balance their clinical value of safety with the maker value of broadened participation in design and production. We analyse their struggles and achievement through the artifacts they produced and the labors of key facilitators between diverse community members. Based on this analysis we provide insights into how medical maker communities, which are necessarily risk-averse and safety-oriented, can still support makers' grassroots efforts to care for their communities. Based on these findings, we recommend that design tools enable adaptation to a wider set of domains, rather than exclusively presenting information relevant to manufacturing. Further, we call for future work on the portability of designs across different types of printers which could enable broader participation in future maker efforts at this scale. ",

      "abstract": "We present Project IRL, a suite of five mobile apps we created to explore novel ways of supporting in-person social interactions with Augmented Reality. In recent years, public discourse has blamed digital technologies for making people feel \"alone together,'' distracting them away from one another when interacting in-person. Motivated this challenge, we focused on an under-explored design space: playful co-located interactions. We evaluated the apps through a deployment study that involved interviews and participant observations with 101 people. We synthesized the results into a design guidelines focused on four themes: (1) device arrangement, e.g., are people sharing one phone, or does each have their own? (2) enablers, e.g., should the activity focus on an object, body part, or pet?, (3) affordances of modifying reality, and (4) types of play. We close by providing design guidelines for future work on embodied social AR. ",

      "abstract": "Financial technology (FinTech) platforms often exclude certain countries from their services due to global political conflicts. As a result, immigrants from the neglected countries struggle with transferring money to and from their homeland through formal mechanisms. Instead, they get involved in informal transnational transactions that, while flexible, are often risky and full of hassles. We looked into this issue through an online survey (n=127) and engaged with multiple stakeholders (n=16), including the Iranian immigrant community in Canada, to co-design an application called ‘Kabootar’ that matches senders and receivers of money across borders. In this application, a sender receiver pair is matched with a pertinent pair sending money in the opposite direction. By facilitating two intra-national transactions in local currencies instead of two relatively complicated inter-national transactions, the need for money to cross borders is eliminated while staying within the boundaries of the law. Our user study (n=13) revealed several tensions in users trusting such informal transnational transactions. This work contributes to CSCW, HCI, and social computing’s growing scholarship in personalized and collaborative computing technologies by advocating for a novel design approach based on collaboration and informality and extends their scope to the domain of FinTech for politically marginalized communities.",

      "abstract": "Noise pollution is among the most consistently cited and highest impact quality-of-life issues in major urban areas across the US, with more than 70 million people estimated to be exposed to noise levels considered harmful. While HCI and CSCW has a relatively rich history of engagement with monitoring such environmental concerns, e.g. through participatory sensing, prior research has not to our knowledge engaged with the process of municipal mitigation. In this paper we present research in this direction, connecting support for pervasive environmental monitoring with civic engagement in mitigation action. Having first identified and described the research space for this engagement, we present empirical data from an ongoing case study focused on two communities living with chronic problem noise. We probe the experiences of residents and representatives of different municipal organizations tasked with addressing their concerns. We find that making and drawing on records of noise is important to residents and authorities, that these groups have misaligned perceptions of how effective current reporting programs are, and that communication between them can be poor. We also find that noise is often one part of more complex issues.We then discuss our findings in light of prior research, and identify a model of civic sensing that highlights opportunities for HCI design and research including: supporting residents’ coordinated actions and actions with municipal open data, mediating residents’ and authorities’ assessments of data quality, and supporting accountability and attributable mitigation action.",

      "abstract": "Various tools and practices have been developed to support practitioners in identifying, assessing, and mitigating fairness-related harms caused by AI systems. However, prior research has highlighted gaps between the intended design of these tools and practices and their use within particular contexts, including gaps caused by the role that organizational factors play in shaping fairness work. In this paper, we investigate these gaps for one such practice: disaggregated evaluations of AI systems, intended to uncover performance disparities between demographic groups. By conducting semi-structured interviews and structured workshops with thirty-three AI practitioners from ten teams at three technology companies, we identify practitioners' processes, challenges, and needs for support when designing disaggregated evaluations. We find that practitioners face challenges when choosing performance metrics, identifying the most relevant direct stakeholders and demographic groups on which to focus, and collecting datasets with which to conduct disaggregated evaluations. More generally, we identify impacts on fairness work stemming from a lack of engagement with direct stakeholders, business imperatives that prioritize customers over marginalized groups, and the drive to deploy AI systems at scale.",

      "abstract": "Smart voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home are becoming increasingly pervasive in our homes. Despite their benefits, their miniaturized and embedded sensors (such as cameras and microphones) raise serious privacy concerns related to surveillance and eavesdropping. Recent work on understanding users' privacy concerns around these devices has highlighted the need for 'tangible privacy' where control and feedback mechanisms can provide a more assured sense of privacy (as with camera lens covers). To address this gap in the design of IoT devices, especially in the case of disabling microphones, we evaluate several designs of smart voice assistants that incorporate (or not) tangible control and feedback mechanisms. By comparing user's perceptions of risk, trust, reliability, usability, and control for these designs in a between-subjects online experiment (N=261), we find that users considered devices with tangible built-in physical controls to be more trustworthy and usable than non-tangible mechanisms. Our findings present an approach for tangible, assured privacy especially in the context of embedded microphones.",

Why do these overlapping communities exist? We provide an answer grounded inthe analysis of 20 interviews with active participants in clusters of highly related subreddits: Within a broadtopical area, there are a diversity of benefits that an online community can confer. These include: (a) specificinformation and discussions, (b) socialization with similar others, and (c) attention from the largest possibleaudience. A single community cannot meet every need. Our findings suggest that growing areas of interest onan platform for online communities tend to become populated by groups of specialized communities withdiverse membership sizes, topical boundaries, and rules.

      "abstract": "Feedback is a critical piece of the creative process. Prior CSCW research has invented peer-based and crowd-based systems that exchange feedback between online strangers at scale. However, creators run into socio-psychological challenges when engaging in online critique exchange with people they have never met. In this study, we step back and take a different approach to investigate online feedback by casting our attention to creators in online affinity spaces, where feedback exchange happens naturally as part of the interest-driven participatory culture. We present an interview study with 29 fanfiction writers that investigated how they seek feedback online, and how they identified and built connections with feedback providers. We identify four distinct feedback practices and unpack the social needs in feedback exchange. Our findings surface the importance of affinity and trust in online feedback exchange and illustrate how writers built relationships with feedback providers in public and private online spaces. Inspired by the powerful stories we heard about connection and feedback, we conclude with a series of design considerations for future feedback systems—namely addressing a range of social needs in feedback, helping feedback seekers signal interests and identity, supporting authentic relationships in feedback exchange, and building inclusive, safe community spaces for feedback.",

      "abstract": "We advance the concept of deconstructed identity to explain how online workers’ identities are being reshaped, diminished and controlled by digital labor platforms. We focus on online freelance workers and contribute to contemporary conceptualizations regarding worker’s self-presentation. The empirical basis for our analysis and theorizing build from two rounds of a longitudinal panel study of online freelance workers and their interactions with online labor platforms. Findings illuminate how online freelancer’s identity presentation is constrained by the structuring of their profile, the ratings and client feedback, the algorithms used by the digital platform, and platform’s terms of use. Data demonstrate that workers’ profiles are focused on skills, reflecting the realities of competing for work in under-regulated labor markets. Study participants report the centrality of client and platform ratings of their work, and the need to manage client feedback and ratings as a core part of their online identity presentation. These findings suggest that, far from a subjective and personal story, a freelancer’s identity on a digital labor platform is better understood as a standardized depiction of skills, ratings, and metrics controlled by platform algorithms. Coupled with use policies and evolving platform designs, this platform control creates what seems to be a form of indentured servitude. We further note online freelancers both recognize this control and resist their deconstructed identity.",

      "abstract": "Hyper-partisan misinformation has become a major public concern. To examine what type of misinformation label can mitigate hyper-partisan misinformation sharing on social media, we conducted a 4 (label type: algorithm, community, third-party fact-checker, and no label) X 2 (post ideology: liberal and conservative) between-subjects online experiment (𝑁 = 1,677) in the context of COVID-19 health information. The results suggest that for liberal users, all labels reduced the perceived accuracy and believability of fake posts regardless of the posts’ ideology. In contrast, for conservative users, the efficacy of the labels depended on whether the posts were ideologically consistent: Algorithmic labels were more effective in reducing the perceived accuracy and believability of fake conservative posts compared to community labels, whereas all labels were effective in reducing their belief in liberal posts. Our results shed light on the differing effects of various labels dependent on people’s political ideology.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning models are commonly used to detect toxicity in online conversations. These models are trained on datasets annotated by human raters. We explore how raters' self-described identities impact how they annotate toxicity in online comments. We first define the concept of Specialized rater pools: rater pools formed based on raters' self-described identities, rather than at random. We formed three such rater pools for this study - specialized rater pools of raters from the U.S. who identify as African American,  LGBTQ, and those who identify as neither. Each of these rater pools annotated the same set of comments, which contains many references to these identity groups. We found that rater identity is a statistically significant factor in how raters will annotate toxicity for identity-related annotations. Using preliminary content analysis, we examined the comments with the most disagreement between rater pools and found nuanced differences in the toxicity annotations. Next, we trained models on the annotations from each of the different rater pools, and compared the scores of these models on comments from several test sets. Finally, we discuss how using raters that self-identify with the subjects of comments can create more inclusive machine learning models, and provide more nuanced ratings than those by random raters.",

These possessions and connections pose difficulties for users -- they are identity markers of an identity that one may no longer want legible to their online audiences. Further, they can cause upsetting moments that might impede moving on from the break-up. \r\nThrough interviews with 11 women who had had a recent break-up, this empirical study examined how people managed their online identity after their break-up. We found that people took different actions towards their possessions and connections in service of creating a post-break-up identity. Using Brubaker & Hayes's (2011) representational framework, we find users attempting to deal with connections as if they were possessions, creating tensions that our current systems are ill-suited to address. Turning to Hogan’s (2010) framework of the online identity ‘exhibition’, we see users creating exhibitions for an audience of one – themselves – while also making decisions about who is allowed to see their public-facing exhibitions. We conclude by arguing that existing tools are ill-designed to support competing desires to present authentic past and future online identities and offer design suggestions for consideration.",

      "abstract": "By identifying the socio-technical conditions required for teams to work effectively remotely, the Distance Matters framework has been influential in CSCW since its introduction in 2000. Advances in collaboration technology and practices have since brought teams increasingly closer to achieving these conditions. This paper presents a ten-month ethnography in a remote organization, where we observed that despite exhibiting excellent remote collaboration, teams paradoxically struggled to collaborate across team boundaries. We extend the Distance Matters framework to account for inter-team collaboration, arguing that challenges analogous to those in the original intra-team framework --- common ground, collaboration readiness, collaboration technology readiness, and coupling of work --- persist but are actualized differently at the inter-team scale. Finally, we identify a fundamental tension between the intra- and inter-team layers: the collaboration technology and practices that help individual teams thrive (e.g., adopting customized collaboration software) can also prompt collaboration challenges in the inter-team layer, and conversely the technology and practices that facilitate inter-team collaboration (e.g., strong centralized IT organizations) can harm practices at the intra-team layer. The addition of the inter-team layer to the Distance Matters framework opens new opportunities for CSCW, where balancing the tension between team and organizational collaboration needs will be a critical technological, operational, and organizational challenge for remote work in the coming decades.",

      "abstract": "Before urban flooding actually happens, weather forecasts with varying degrees of precision are available to emergency managers.  In the aftermath of the event, authoritative information including Earth Observation (EO) data can be used to estimate precisely the flood extent, possibly after several hours. This study aims to determine how social media information can reduce the inherent uncertainty of the information in the immediate aftermath of an urban flood event. Specifically, the study investigates how to collect relevant social media images and to interpolate such data in order to create a map. \r\nThe premise of the study is that social media platforms, when combined with digital surface models, can provide control points for creating a reliable near real-time estimate of the flood extent. In the study, we compared a flood extent map derived from social media with that derived from authoritative altimetry data during one of the worst floods to hit Venice, which occurred in November 2019. \r\nThe results of the experiments show a good overall accuracy using several digital surface models. Given the global coverage of such models and the low resources required, we think the methodology proposed could be beneficial for emergency managers. Specifically, we describe how a flood extent map can be made available within 24 h, or even less,  after urban flooding strikes a densely inhabited area, where data generated by the public are available.",

      "abstract": "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the behavioral health domain has led to a growing interest in the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to identify patterns in people’s personal data with the goal of detecting—and even predicting—conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. This paper investigates the data science practices and design narratives that underlie AI-mediated behavioral health through the situational analysis of three natural language processing (NLP) training datasets. Examining datasets as a sociotechnical system inextricably connected to particular social worlds, discourses, and infrastructural arrangements, we identify several misalignments between the technical project of dataset construction and benchmarking (a current focus of AI research in the behavioral health domain) and the social complexity of behavioral health. Our study contributes to a growing critical CSCW literature of AI systems by articulating the sensitizing concept of disordering datasets that aims to productively trouble dominant logics of AI/ML applications in behavioral health, and also support researchers and designers in reflecting on their roles and responsibilities working within this emerging and sensitive design space.",

      "abstract": "Commercial organisations continue to face a growing and evolving threat of data breaches and system compromises, making their cyber-security function critically important. Many organisations employ a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to lead such a function. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 15 CISOs and six senior organisational leaders, between October 2019 and July 2020, as part of a wider exploration into the purpose of CISOs and cyber-security functions. In this paper, we employ broader security scholarship related to ontological security and sociological notions of identity work to provide an interpretative analysis of the CISO role in organisations. Research findings reveal that cyber security is an expert system that positions the CISO as an interpreter of something that is mystical, unknown and fearful to the uninitiated. They show how the fearful nature of cyber security contributes to it being considered an ontological threat by the organisation, while responding to that threat contributes to the organisation's overall identity. We further show how cyber security is analogous to a belief system and how one of the roles of the CISO is akin to that of a modern-day soothsayer for senior management; that this role is precarious and, at the same time, superior, leading to alienation within the organisation. Our study also highlights that the CISO identity of protector-from-threat, linked to the precarious position, motivates self-serving actions that we term `cyber sophistry'. We conclude by outlining a series of implications for both organisations and CISOs.",

      "abstract": "The wide spread of misinformation contributes to information consumers’ excessed distrust of online information. To cope, information consumers are often actively involved in checking the credibility of information through self-researching or seeking help and opinions from experts and peers. While previous studies investigated the factors that affect people’s perceptions of information credibility and how laypeople’s judgements compare to experts, little is known about how the information credibility assessment work is performed and cooperated by individuals and communities in real-life, natural online environments. Through a qualitative study of an online community, r/DebunkThis, which is dedicated to information debunking, we found that online information debunking rarely followed a linear and straightforward path. Rather, community members, including the debunkers and the original posters, constantly negotiated and interacted with each other to determine what to debunk and how to debunk. Individuals adopted various strategies to debunk information, such as questioning the credibility of the information source and citing authoritative external information. Community members supplemented with details and explanations, corrected others, requested clarifications, summarized high-level knowledge and skills, and interacted socially based on individuals' debunking explanations. Our study results broaden the understanding of debunking not only as an outcome but also as a learning and social process for community members to learn high-level debunking skills and form and enforce community rules. We provide implications for designing community and crowd-based information debunking systems which should recognize the complex, cooperative, and socially situated work of community and crowd debunkers. The design of such systems should therefore support not only labeling information as correct or not or simply sharing alternative information sources, but also community interactions and learning processes, as well as recognizing the labor of community debunkers.

We provide an overview of APEX, a framework that builds on both prior work and experimentally derived data to provide an understanding of how visitors’ physical, social, emotional, and intellectual engagement transform during the course of their interaction with an exhibit. We present two case studies demonstrating how to apply APEX in practice, analyzing video recordings of participant interactions with different design iterations of TuneTable—an interactive exhibit for co-creative computational music-making—at both a macro- and micro-level. In the case studies, we explore how APEX reveals important features of participant interaction that suggest implications and directions for design. Finally, we present a toolkit of resources to aid researchers in operationalizing APEX as a framework for video analysis, in-situ observation, and iterative design and evaluation. ",

      "abstract": "Algorithmic systems that recommend content often lack transparency about how they come to their suggestions. One area in which recommender systems are increasingly prevalent is online news distribution. In this paper, we explore how a lack of transparency of (news) recommenders can be tackled by involving users in the design of interface elements. In the context of automated decision-making, legislative frameworks such as the GDPR in Europe introduce a specific conception of transparency, granting `data subjects' specific rights and imposing obligations on service providers. An important related question is how people using personalized recommender systems relate to the issue of transparency, not as legal data subjects but as users. This paper builds upon a two-phase study on how users conceive of transparency and related issues in the context of algorithmic news recommenders. We organized co-design workshops to elicit participants' `algorithmic imaginaries' and invited them to ideate interface elements for increased transparency. This revealed the importance of combining legible transparency features with features that increase user control. We then conducted a qualitative evaluation of mock-up prototypes to investigate users' preferences and concerns when dealing with design features to increase transparency and control. Our investigation illustrates how users' expectations and impressions of news recommenders are closely related to their news reading practices. On a broader level, we show how transparency and control are conceptually intertwined. Transparency without control leaves users frustrated. Conversely, without a basic level of transparency into how a system works, users remain unsure of the impact of controls.",

      "abstract": "Sexual exploration is a natural part of adolescent development; yet, unmediated internet access has enabled teens to engage in a wider variety of potentially riskier sexual interactions than previous generations, from normatively appropriate sexual interactions to sexually abusive situations. Teens have turned to online peer support platforms to disclose and seek support about these experiences. Therefore, we analyzed posts (N = 45,955) made by adolescents (ages 13--17) on an online peer support platform to deeply examine their online sexual risk experiences. By applying a mixed methods approach, we 1) accurately (average of AUC = 0.90) identified posts that contained teen disclosures about online sexual risk experiences and classified the posts based on level of consent (i.e., consensual, non-consensual, sexual abuse) and relationship type (i.e., stranger, dating/friend, family) between the teen and the person in which they shared the sexual experience, 2) detected statistically significant differences in the proportions of posts based on these dimensions, and 3) further unpacked the nuance in how these online sexual risk experiences were typically characterized in the posts. Teens were significantly more likely to engage in consensual sexting with friends/dating partners; unwanted solicitations were more likely from strangers and sexual abuse was more likely when a family member was involved. We contribute to the HCI and CSCW literature around youth online sexual risk experiences by moving beyond the false dichotomy of \"safe'' versus \"risky''. Our work provides a deeper understanding of technology-mediated adolescent sexual behaviors from the perspectives of sexual well-being, risk detection, and the prevention of online sexual violence toward youth.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge of information visualizations that aim to increase our scientific understanding and communicate about the ongoing health crisis with the general public. In this time, there has also been significant use of data visualization language in artefacts from online communities that provide commentary on the pandemic and create meaning through participatory digital culture. Using a qualitative approach, this paper examines over 300 memes collected from a public social media group targeted to young adults in the United States that uses the language of data visualization to discuss topics related to COVID-19. We outline four main ways that data visualization language is used in these memes—as a coarse indicator, as a visual analogy, as an opportunity for augmentation with emotion or interpretation, and as a visual pun—as well as two ways that memes leverage traditional and emerging approaches in the information visualization community. We describe the context in which these memes are socially created and interpreted in light of the political nature of online spaces and connect this work to ongoing research on participation, emotion, and embodiment in information visualization. These results aim to start a conversation about the use of data visualization language in digital culture and more casual networked environments beyond official channels. ",

      "abstract": "As computing courses become larger, students of minoritized groups continue to disproportionately face challenges that hinder their academic and professional success (e.g. implicit bias, microaggressions, lack of resources, assumptions of preparatory privilege). This can impact career aspirations and sense of belonging in computing communities. Instructors have the power to make immediate changes to support more equitable learning, but they are often unaware of students’ challenges. To help both instructors and students understand the inequities in their classes, we developed Student Amp, an interactive system that uses student feedback and self-reported demographic information (e.g. gender, ethnicity, disability, educational background) to show challenges and how they affect students differently. To help instructors make sense of feedback, Student Amp ranks challenges by student-perceived disruptivness. We conducted formative evaluations with five large college computing courses (150 - 750 students) being taught remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that students shared challenges beyond the scope of the course, perceived sharing information about who they were as useful but potentially dangerous, and that teaching teams were able to use this information to consider the positionality of students sharing challenges. Our findings relate to a central design tension of supporting equity by sharing contextualized information about students while also ensuring their privacy and well-being.",

Through an online survey with 84 new mothers in Hong Kong and six-month follow-up interviews with one family, we investigate the practices of our participants mobilizing their support network to help with childcare, their experiences with infant-centric family informatics in the process, and the barriers, needs, and expectations that emerged. Our findings suggest that postpartum mothers may offload different types of babysitting tasks to different caregivers; they try to orchestrate the whole process through assorted communication media but may face a variety of practical and relational challenges. New mothers demand affordable, usable, and accessible information and communication supports to streamline infant-centric family informatics, if applicable. We thus propose a set of design considerations as to how a (connected) system of low-, medium-, and/or high-tech informatics tools could better foster mobilization of instrumental childcare support.",

      "abstract": "Microtask crowdsourcing holds great potential as an employment opportunity with the flexibility and anonymity that individuals with disability may require. Though prior research has explored the accessibility of crowd work, the lived crowd work experiences of the broader community of workers with disability are still largely under-explored, especially when it comes to how their experiences are similar to or different from the experiences of workers without disability. In this work, we aim to obtain a deeper understanding of the microtask crowdsourcing experience for people with disabilities, especially regarding their financial and social experiences of participating in crowd work, along with the benefits and challenges that they encounter through this work. Specifically, we first surveyed 1,200 crowd workers both with and without disability about their experiences using the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform, and the differences we found inspired the design of a follow-up survey to gain greater understanding of the crowd work experience for workers with disability. Our findings reveal that workers with disability receive unique benefits from performing crowd work, such as a greater sense of purpose, but also encounter many challenges, such as completing tasks on time and earning a livable wage, causing them to turn to online communities for assistance. Although many of the challenges they face are not unique to crowd workers with disability, workers with disability may be disproportionately impacted by these challenges. From our findings, we provide implications for crowd platforms, as well as the gig economy as a whole, that seek to promote greater consideration of workers with a diverse range of conditions to create a more valuable work experience for them.",

      "abstract": "Fast-paced knowledge and expertise sharing (KES) is a typical demand in contemporary workplaces due to dynamic markets and ever-changing work practices. Past and current computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) research has long been investigating how computer technologies can support people with KES. Recent claims have asserted that augmented reality- (AR-)based cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) are poised to bring significant changes in the ways that KES unfolds in manufacturing contexts. This paper scrutinises such claims by implementing a short-term evaluation of an AR-based CPPS and assessing how it can potentially support (1) the generation of AR content by experienced production workers and (2) the visualisation and processing of such content by novice workers. We, therefore, contribute a user study to the CSCW community that sheds light on the use of a particular type of AR-based CPPS for KES in industrial contexts.",

      "abstract": "Awareness, and specifically, spatial awareness, has long played a pivotal role in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work research in both theory and design. This significant background gives awareness the ability to answer challenges facing human-agent teams in communication and shared understanding. As such, the current study investigates the effects of spatial information level (low, high) on the development of team cognition and its outcomes in varying compositions of human-agent teams (human-human-agent, human-agent-agent) versus human-only (human-human-human) teams. The mixed-methods study had teams complete several rounds of the NeoCITIES emergency response management simulation and complete various team cognition and perception measures, followed by qualitative free-response questions. The study found that human-only teams did not perform at the same level as human-agent teams, with multi-agent human-agent teams having the best performance. A significant interaction, though with inconclusive simple main effects, displayed the trend that human-agent teams had better team mental model similarity when spatial awareness was high rather than low, while human-only teams experienced the reverse trend. Qualitative findings identified that high spatial awareness jump-started team cognition development, fostered more accurate shared mental models, enhanced the explainability of the agent, and helped the iterative development of team cognition over time.",

      "abstract": "Targeted advertising can harm vulnerable groups when it targets individuals' personal and psychological vulnerabilities. We focus on how targeted weight-loss advertisements harm people with histories of disordered eating. We identify three features of targeted advertising that cause harm: the persistence of personal data that can expose vulnerabilities, over-simplifying algorithmic relevancy models, and design patterns that increase engagement but can also encourage unhealthy behavior. Through a series of semi-structured interviews with individuals with histories of unhealthy body stigma, dieting, and disordered eating, we found that targeted weight-loss ads posed a range of negative emotional and physical outcomes, placing a burden of individual responsibility on the user. At the same time, we observed that targeted individuals demonstrated agency and resistance against distressing ads. Drawing on scholarship in postcolonial environmental studies, we use the concept of slow violence to articulate how targeted advertising inflicts concrete harms on vulnerable populations. CAUTION: This paper includes media that could be triggering, particularly to people with an eating disorder. Please use caution when reading, printing, or disseminating this paper. ",

      "abstract": "In August 2020, the U.S. presidential administration issued an executive order to ban the Chinese-based social platform WeChat, alleging that WeChat posed a national security risk. However, WeChat is a vital application for Chinese diasporic communities in the U.S. The ban’s status and outcome were uncertain for several months before it was temporarily halted and later revoked in 2021. Through interviews with 15 WeChat users and online participant observation, this study examines the anticipated impacts of the potential WeChat ban and participants’ subsequent reactions. We find that in response to the potential ban, participants described negative consequences, including adverse network and economic effects and disruption of community-building efforts. We also find that many participants considered WeChat to be critical infrastructure in the U.S., as it has become an indispensable part of their daily lives. To frame participants’ experiences, we introduce the concept of infrastructural migration – the process of users relocating to another digital media service that embodies the properties and functions of infrastructure or moving to an assemblage of different applications that meet their infrastructural needs separately. We then discuss implications for designing for infrastructural migration and future considerations for HCI research with diasporic communities.",

      "abstract": "The sex industry exists on a continuum based on the degree of work autonomy present in one's labor conditions: a high degree of autonomy exists on one side of the continuum where certain independent sex workers have a great deal of agency, while much less autonomy exists on the other side, where sex is traded under conditions of human trafficking. Various organizations across North America perform outreach to sex workers to offer assistance in the form of services (e.g., healthcare, financial assistance, housing) as well as prayer and intervention. Increasingly, technology is used to look for trafficking victims and/or facilitate the provision of assistance or services, for example through scraping and parsing sex industry workers' advertisements into a database of contact information that can be used by outreach organizations. However, little is known about the efficacy of anti-trafficking outreach technology, nor the potential risks of using such technology to identify and contact the highly stigmatized and marginalized population of those working in the sex industry.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we investigate the use, context, benefits, and harms of an anti-trafficking technology platform via qualitative interviews with multiple stakeholders: the technology developers (n=6), organizations that use the technology (n=17), and sex industry workers who have been contacted or wish to be contacted (n=24). Our findings illustrate misalignment between developers, users of the platform, and sex industry workers they are attempting to assist. In their current state, anti-trafficking outreach tools such as the one we investigate are ineffective and, at best, serve as a mechanism for spam and, at worst, scale and exacerbate harm against the population they aim to serve. We conclude with a discussion of best practices -- and the feasibility of their implementation -- for technology-facilitated outreach efforts to minimize risk or harm to sex industry workers while efficiently providing needed services.",

      "abstract": "Rapid technological innovations, especially in the Information Technology space, demand the workforce to be vigilant by acquiring new skills to remain relevant and employable. The workforce needs to be engaged in a continuous lifelong learning process by educating themselves about skills that will be in-demand in the future. To do so, it is important for students, job seekers, and even recruiters to know which skills will be in demand in the future to invest time and resources in these skills. On this basis, the main objective of this paper is to investigate whether social content can offer insight into potential future in-demand skills in the IT job market. Based on the analysis of social content from Reddit and Job Posting data from Dice and Monster websites, we find that social content related to job skills are strong indicators for future in demand skills. We further find that specific social content associated with recruitment-related topics are stronger indicators of future skills. Our findings encourage learners and job seekers to pay close attention to online social content to forward plan new skills and maximize their employability.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, social movements are driven by networks of people who are resorting to social media platforms to rally, self-organise and coordinate action around a shared cause, which can be referred to as the formation of publics. Due to years of political instability, conflicts, corruption, sectarianism, economic collapse and declining living conditions, in October, 2019, Lebanon witnessed uprisings which transcended into a wider social movement. As the movement unfolded, Lebanese diaspora members living across the world formed their own publics in support of the Lebanese revolution that interfaced with the local Lebanon-based publics. As such, a broader transnational public emerged as a result of the coordinated online and offline efforts between diaspora actors and local actors which had a crucial role in mitigating the aftermath of the compounded crises that hit Lebanon. In this paper, through observation and interviews with Lebanese diaspora members, we contribute a socio-technical understanding of the formation of a transnational public, with a particular focus on the underlying infrastructures that enabled its creation. Furthermore, we surface the challenges in relation to sustaining such a diaspora public and its interfacing with local publics in Lebanon. We contribute empirical insights that highlight how different technological tools and platforms coupled with social processes built within diaspora groups and with local actors led to the formation of such a multi-layered transnational public.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 induced lockdowns forced people to shift several activities, including education, online. However, in the context of online schooling, the Digital Divides have magnified and perpetuated existing inequities in the education system and in society. Through a qualitative study with 48 participants across 5 stakeholder groups we find that students in under-funded government schools in India largely have not been able to access online classes because of a lack of devices, poor quality of Internet access, unreliable data networks and expensive data plans. We also document attempts by teachers and non-profit workers to use mass media broadcast technologies to work around the issue of digital access, highlighting the importance of a human infrastructure to build resilience during a disruptive event. Socioeconomic factors have also forced a lot of students to drop out of schools and into taking up jobs to support their families. We document the importance of enabling environments and economic safety nets at home for online education to succeed. We present some focus points for researchers and policy makers working in the space of digital divide and education to build more resilient systems through Digital Welfarism.",

      "abstract": "Understanding social interactions and generous behaviors have long been of considerable interest in the social science community. While the contagion of generosity is documented in the real world, less is known about such phenomenon in virtual worlds and whether it has an actionable impact on user behavior and retention. In this work, we analyze social dynamics in the virtual world of the popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) Sky: Children of Light. We develop a framework to reveal the patterns of generosity in such social environments and provide empirical evidence of social contagion and contagious generosity. Players become more engaged in the game after playing with others and especially with friends. We also find that players who experience generosity first-hand or even observe other players conduct generous acts become more generous themselves in the future. Additionally, we show that both receiving and observing generosity lead to higher future engagement in the game. Since Sky resembles the real world from a social play aspect, the implications of our findings also go beyond this virtual world.",

      "abstract": "Participation in communities is essential to individual mental and physical health and can yield further benefits for members. With a growing amount of time spent participating in virtual communities, it's increasingly important that we understand how the community experience manifests in and varies across these online spaces. In this paper, we investigate Sense of Virtual Community (SOVC) in the context of live-streaming communities. Through a survey of 1,944 Twitch viewers, we identify that community experiences on Twitch vary along two primary dimensions: belonging}, a feeling of membership and support within the group, and cohesion, a feeling that the group is a well-run collective with standards for behavior. Leveraging the Social-Ecological Model, we map behavioral trace data from usage logs to various levels of the social ecology surrounding an individual user's participation within a community, in order to identify which of these can be associated with lower or higher SOVC. We find that features describing activity at the individual and community levels, but not features describing the community member's dyadic relationships, can aid in predicting the SOVC that community members feel within channels. We consider implications for the design of live-streaming communities and for fostering the well-being of their members, and we consider theoretical implications for the study of SOVC in modern, interactive online contexts, including those beyond livestreaming communities. We also explore how the Social-Ecological Model can be leveraged in other contexts relevant to Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), with implications for future work.",

Using a large-scale Reddit moderation action against QAnon-related activities in 2018 as the source, we identify 13 thousand users active in the early QAnon communities. We then collect the 2.1 million submissions and 10.8 million comments posted by these users across all of Reddit from October, 2016 to January, 2021. The majority of these users were only active after the emergence of the QAnon conspiracy theory and before the 2018 QAnon ban. A qualitative analysis on the 915 sampled subreddits where the more QAnon-enthusiastic users were especially active shows that they participated in a diverse range of subreddits, often of unrelated topics to QAnon. However, most of the users' submissions were concentrated in subreddits that have sympathetic attitudes towards the conspiracy theory, characterized by discussions that were pro-Trump or emphasized unconstricted behaviors (often anti-establishment and anti-interventionist). Most of these submissions consist of links from low-quality sources, bringing potential harm to the broader Reddit community. These results point to the likelihood that QAnon users on Reddit are dedicated and committed to the conspiracy, providing implications on both platform moderation design and future research.",

      "abstract": "Algorithmic risk assessment tools are now commonplace in public sector domains such as criminal justice and human services.  These tools are intended to aid decision makers in systematically using rich and complex data captured in administrative systems.  In this study we investigate sources of heterogeneity in the alignment between worker decisions and algorithmic risk scores in the context of a real world child abuse hotline screening use case.  Specifically, we focus on heterogeneity related to worker experience.  We find that senior workers are far more likely to screen in referrals for investigation, even after we control for the observed algorithmic risk score and other case characteristics.  We also observe that the decisions of less-experienced workers are more closely aligned with algorithmic risk scores than those of senior workers who had decision-making experience prior to the tool being introduced. While screening decisions vary across child race, we do not find evidence of racial differences in the relationship between worker experience and screening decisions.  Our findings indicate that it is important for agencies and system designers to consider ways of preserving institutional knowledge when introducing algorithms into high employee turnover settings such as child welfare call screening.

      "abstract": "The design of child-centred, intelligent and collaborative robots is a challenging endeavour, which requires to understand how the implemented robot behaviours and collaboration paradigms affect children's perception about the robot. \r\nThis paper presents the results of a set of semi-structured interviews of N=81, 5 to 8 years old children who previously interacted in pairs with a robot in the context of a problem-solving task. We manipulated two different factors of the robot behaviour: cognitive reliability in logic game movements (optimal vs sub-optimal) and expressivity in the communication (expressive vs neutral) and we assigned the children in one of the four conditions. At post-intervention interviews, we examined children's perceptions on the robot's attributions, collaboration and social role. Results indicate that a robot's \r\ncognitive reliability shapes the helping relationship between the children and the robot, while the robot's expressivity impacts children perception of the robot supportive ability and friendship. Finally, results also indicate that, even if children interact in pairs with the robot, their perceptions about it remain individual, although a good collective task-performance seems to empower children perception of the robot in terms of friendship and reliability.",

      "abstract": "People living with dementia as well as dementia caregivers are finding new ways to provide and receive support online. The emerging use of social media platforms—such as TikTok, Clubhouse, and Facebook—by people with dementia and dementia caregivers enables new forms of sharing about stigmatized, poorly understood, and often under-discussed experiences. Building on prior work focused on formal support groups, we report findings from an interview study of how people living with dementia and dementia caregivers provide and receive social support through emerging online spaces and communities. Our analysis reveals that both groups cultivate new online spaces for sharing about the experience of dementia while also navigating tensions surrounding public disclosure of lived experiences, advocacy, education, and the ability to protect and keep private elements of life experiences. We discuss how these groups cultivate online spaces across platforms and contribute to ongoing ethical debates about consent in online communities. We conclude with questions that guide future work on emerging online spaces for supporting people living with dementia and caregivers of people living with dementia. ",

      "abstract": "The platforms that host online gaming groups and communities continue to evolve, and it has become possible to join, participate in, and consume content from groups that exist across multiple tools, platforms, and spaces at the same time. In this paper, we explore how groups use and rely upon assemblages of multiple online spaces to accomplish the \"work\" of participating in these gaming groups. We present an interview study with users of the100.io, a platform that hosts gaming community spaces, helps players find groups, and operates as a gaming event scheduling tool for its users. Contrary to our initial assumptions, we found that users relied upon the100 as a kind of glue for flexibly-interconnected, multi-space group configurations. These multi-space groups support our participants' desires to approach online gaming as a social practice, provide additional accountability among players, and enable multiple forms of social participation within those communities. Our findings point towards opportunities to expand social computing scholarship to better describe how users of online communities flexibly bridge across technical infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "Centralized online social networks — e.g., Facebook, Twitter and TikTok — help drive social connection on the Internet, but have nigh unfettered access to monitor and monetize the personal data of their users. This centralization can especially undermine the use of the social internet by minority populations, who disproportionately bear the costs of institutional surveillance. We introduce a new class of privacy-enhancing technology — decentralized privacy overlays (DePOs) — that helps cOSN users regain some control over their personal data by allowing them to selectively share secret content on cOSNs through decentralized content distribution networks. As a first step, we present an implementation and user evaluation of Image DePO, a proof-of-concept design probe that allows users to upload and share secret photos on Facebook through the Interplanetary File System peer-to-peer protocol. We qualitatively evaluated Image DePO in a controlled, test environment with 19 queer and Black, Indigenous, (and) Person of Color (BIPOC) participants. We found that while Image DePO could help address the institutional threats with which our participants expressed concern, interpersonal threats were the more salient concern in their decisions to share content. Accordingly, we argue that in order to see widespread use, DePOs must align protection against abstract institutional threats with protection against the more salient interpersonal threats users consider when making specific sharing decisions.",

      "abstract": "Consumer surveillance products such as 'smart' doorbell cameras are an already-pervasive phenomenon in the U.S. These devices are marketed as personal and community security tools that allow users to answer their front door remotely, record \"suspicious activity'' captured by their cameras, and share reports with neighbors. The widespread use of doorbell cameras specifically, however, has created an opaque, wide-reaching surveillance network used by thousands of law enforcement agencies nationwide. The full breadth of this network and how users operate on such platforms is largely unknown. Amazon Ring, one of the largest manufacturers of smart doorbells, offers a companion social networking app to their physical doorbells called Ring Neighbors that allows camera owners to share video and text posts with other camera owners that live nearby. In this paper, we use data collected from public posts on Neighbors to create what we believe is the first comprehensive map and analysis of smart doorbell camera use across the continental U.S. We use spatial regression methods to estimate the county-level predictors of Neighbors app usage nationally. We then use Los Angeles, one of the most active areas of Ring usage in the country, as a case study to investigate how different neighborhoods in a racially heterogeneous city use a platform like Ring. Using a structured topic analysis and experimental survey design, we show that users actively frame video subjects as criminal and suspicious, that the race of a neighborhood has a significant impact on posting rates, and some evidence that Neighbors may be used as a racial gatekeeping tool, particularly by white neighborhoods that border non-white areas in Los Angeles.",

      "abstract": "Social platforms open important doors to visibility for transgender people, through which they can pursue key goals such as broader recognition and normalization. However, each door is also potentially a trap, filled with risks and consequences — especially for those whose goals require visibility. Via a grounded theory interview study with 17 transfeminine content creators on TikTok, I find that, in an algorithmically mediated environment such as TikTok, users navigate potential doors to visibility and their associated traps via folk theorization. Moreover, I find that transfeminine creators employ multiple complex and overlapping folk theories, with actionable theories guiding the careful navigation of doors to visibility, and demotivational theories alerting creators to traps that are too risky to spring. I introduce five novel folk theories of TikTok spanning both the For You Page and content moderation systems which creators use to guide their decision making, and discuss how two cross-cutting issues, perceived algorithmic paternalism and decontextualization, illustrate major issues for transfeminine creators and opportunities for more supportive design.

      "abstract": "Live streaming is a popular synchronous social media platform that allows users to disclose information to vast audience in real time. It has been increasingly studied in recent years for its unique functions of disseminating user-generated content, enriching streamers’ self-presentation, curating online social interactions and fostering online communities. However, little research has been done to explore the privacy issues in live streaming. In the present paper, we aim to understand streamers’ privacy concerns and strategies in their information disclosure on live streaming. From an interview study with 20 streamers, we found that they expressed concerns and carefully managed their information disclosure based on whether the disclosure would enhance or weaken their attractiveness to the audience and whether it would disturb their interpersonal boundary with the audience. They adopted various technical and behavioral privacy management strategies to cope with their concerns, but encountered a series of usability and cognitive burdens. Based on the findings, we present design implications to improve the privacy management on live streaming.  ",

      "abstract": "Social platforms, and the online communities that use them, are evolving at a rapid pace. As a result, research and development regarding how to moderate online communities is being out-paced. In this paper, we present a novel framework that will allow moderation researchers and practitioners to not only keep-up with the diverse landscape of available platforms and affordances, but also comprehensively represent and analyze moderation on these platforms. The MIC framework represents a social platform's moderation ecosystem using a base-set of 12 platform-level affordances, along with a notion of the inter-affordance relationships that can exist between them. These affordances fall into the three categories---Members, Infrastructure, and Content---that are derived from Grimmelmann's taxonomy of moderation. We demonstrate the advantages of using an affordance-aware framework like MIC by analyzing several social platforms over the course of two case studies. First, we analyze individual platforms using MIC and demonstrate how MIC can be used to examine the effects of platform changes on the moderation ecosystem and identify potential new challenges in moderation. Next, use MIC to systematically compare three platforms and propose potential moderation mechanisms that each can adapt. Moderation researchers and stakeholders can use such comparisons to uncover where platforms can emulate established, successful and better-studied platforms, as well as learn from the pitfalls other platforms have encountered.",

      "abstract": "When members of ad-hoc virtual teams need to collectively ideate or deliberate, they often fail to engage with each others’ perspectives in a constructive manner. At best, this leads to sub-optimal outcomes and, at worst, it can cause conflicts that lead to teams not wanting to continue working together. Prior work has attempted to facilitate constructive communication by highlighting problematic communication patterns and nudging teams to alter their interaction norms. However, these approaches achieve limited success because they fail to acknowledge two social barriers: (1) it is hard to reset team norms mid-interaction, and (2) corrective nudges have limited utility unless team members believe it is safe to voice their opinion and that their opinion will be heard. This paper introduces Empathosphere, a chat-embedded intervention to mitigate these barriers and foster constructive communication in teams. To mitigate the first barrier, Empathosphere leverages the known benefits of “experimental spaces” in dampening existing norms and creating a climate conducive to change. Empathosphere instantiates this “space” as a separate communication channel in a team’s workspace. To mitigate the second barrier, Empathosphere harnesses the benefits of perspective-taking to cultivate a group climate that promotes a norm of members speaking up and engaging with each other. Empathosphere achieves this by orchestrating authentic socio-emotional exchanges designed to induce perspective-taking. A controlled study (𝑁 = 110) compared Empathosphere to an alternate intervention strategy of prompting teams to reflect on their team experience. We found that Empathosphere led to higher work satisfaction, encouraged more open communication and feedback within teams, and boosted teams’ desire to continue working together. This work demonstrates that “experimental spaces,” particularly those that integrate methods of encouraging perspective-taking, can be a powerful means of improving communication in virtual teams",

      "abstract": "Clinical documentation is a time-consuming and challenging task, especially for time-critical medical settings. Even with a dedicated scribe person, timely and accurate documentation under time constraints is never easy. In this work, we present a unique type of fast-paced medical team---emergency medical services (EMS)---which has no designated role for documentation while constantly working outside in the field to provide urgent patient care. Through interviews with 13 EMS practitioners, we reveal several interesting and prominent characteristics of EMS documentation practice as well as their associated challenges: EMS practitioners self-organize and collaborate on documentation while in the meantime being both physically and cognitively preoccupied with high-acuity patients, having limited capability to use handheld documentation systems in real-time, and being overwhelmed by strict documentation requirements and regulations. Lastly, we use our findings to discuss both technical and non-technical implications to support timely and collaborative documentation in dynamic medical contexts while accounting for care providers’ physical and cognitive constraints in using computing devices.

      "abstract": "Facebook and other advertising platforms exploit users’ data for marketing purposes by allowing advertisers to select specific users and target them with well-crafted messages (the practice is being called micro-targeting). However, advertisers such as Cambridge Analytica have maliciously used these targeting features to manipulate users in the context of elections. The European Commission plans to restrict or even ban some targeting functionalities in the new European Democracy Action Plan act to protect users from such harms. The difficulty in finding appropriate restrictions is that we do not know the economic impact of these restrictions on regular advertisers. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, to inform the debate, we take a first step by understanding who is advertising on Facebook and how they use the targeting functionalities of ad platforms. For this, we asked 890 U.S. users to install a monitoring tool on their browsers to collect the ads they receive on Facebook and information about how these ads were targeted. By matching advertisers on Facebook with their LinkedIn profiles, we could see that 71% of advertisers are small and medium-sized businesses with 200 employees or less, and they are responsible for 61% of ads and 57% of ad impressions. \r\n\r\nRegarding micro-targeting, we found that only 32% of small and medium-sized businesses and 30% of large-sized businesses in our datasetet micro-target at least one of their ads. These results should not be interpreted as micro-targeting not being useful as a marketing strategy, but rather that advertisers prefer to outsource the micro-targeting task to ad platforms. Indeed, to deliver ads, Facebook is employing optimization algorithms that exploit user data to decide which users should see what ads; which basically means ad platforms are performing an algorithmic-driven micro-targeting. Hence, when setting restrictions on micro-targeting, legislators should take into account both the traditional advertiser-driven micro-targeting as well as algorithmic-driven micro-targeting performed by ad platforms.",

Our practices around sharing music have shifted markedly with the advent of streaming music platforms and social media, and it has remained an important part of our social fabric. Yet there is a dearth of research on how people share music today, and our understanding of attitudes and practices of sharing music across cultures is even more lacking. To understand how people across cultures engage in music sharing, we have conducted interviews with 32 participants from two cultures: South Korea and United States. Through qualitative analysis, we found largely three reasons why people share music, types of music shared, strategy factors considered when sharing music, outcomes achieved, and challenges people experience when sharing music. We present a framework of music sharing that visualizes these components of the music sharing process. From these results, we identify similarities and differences that emerged. We derive design implications for music sharing platforms including providing varied avenues for feedback on shared music, motivating users to share more, and helping users to better manage shared music.",

      "abstract": "The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic made working from home – wherever working remotely is possible –\r\nthe norm for what had previously been office-based jobs across the world. This change in how we work created\r\na challenging situation for system administrators (sysadmins), as they are the ones building and maintaining\r\nthe digital infrastructure our world relies on.\r\nIn this paper, we examine how system administration work changed early in the pandemic from sysadmins’\r\npersonal perspectives, through semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. We find that sysadmins\r\nfaced a two-sided crisis: While sysadmins’ own work environment changed, they also had to react to the new\r\nsituation and facilitate stable options to work online for themselves and their colleagues, supporting their\r\nusers in adapting to the crisis. This finding embeds into earlier work on the connection between IT (security)\r\nwork and the notion of ‘care’, where we substantiate these earlier findings with results from a repeatable\r\nmethod grounded in coordination theory.\r\nFurthermore, while we find that sysadmins perceived no major changes in the way they work, by consecutively\r\nprobing our interviewees, we find that they did experience several counter-intuitive effects on their\r\nwork. This includes that while day-to-day communication became inherently more difficult, other tasks were\r\nstreamlined by the remote working format and were seen as having become easier. Finally, by structuring\r\nour results according to a model of coordination and communication, we identify changes in sysadmins’\r\ncoordination patterns. From these we derive recommendations for how system administration work can be\r\ncoordinated, ranging beyond the immediate pandemic response and the transition to any ‘new normal’ way\r\nof working.",

      "abstract": "Our research aims to highlight and alleviate the complex tensions around online safety, privacy, and smartphone usage in families so that parents and teens can work together to better manage mobile privacy and security-related risks. We developed a mobile application (\"app\") for Community Oversight of Privacy and Security(“CO-oPS”) and had parents and teens assess whether it would be applicable for use with their families. CO-oPS is an Android app that allows a group of users to co-monitor the apps installed on one another’s devices and the privacy permissions granted to those apps. We conducted a study with 19 parent-teen (ages 13-17)pairs to understand how they currently managed mobile safety and app privacy within their family and then had them install, use, and evaluate the CO-oPS app. We found that both parents and teens gave little consideration to online safety and privacy before installing new apps or granting privacy permissions. When using CO-oPS, participants liked how the app increased transparency into one another’s devices in a way that facilitated communication, but were less inclined to use features for in-app messaging or to hide apps from one another. Key themes related to power imbalances between parents and teens surfaced that made co-management challenging. Parents were more open to collaborative oversight than teens, who felt that it was not their place to monitor their parents, even though both often believed parents lacked the technological expertise to monitor themselves. Our study sheds light on why collaborative practices for managing online safety and privacy within families may be beneficial but also quite difficult to implement in practice. We provide recommendations for overcoming these challenges based on the insights gained from our study.",

      "abstract": "We conducted an online survey and remote usability study to explore user needs related to advertising controls on Facebook and determine how well existing controls align with these needs. Our survey results highlight a range of user objectives related to controlling Facebook ads, including being able to select what ad topics are shown or what personal information is used in ad targeting. Some objectives are achievable with Facebook’s existing controls, but participants seemed to be unaware of them, suggesting issues of discoverability. In our remote usability study, participants noted areas in which the usability of Facebook's advertising controls could be improved, including the location, layout, and explanation of controls. Additionally, we found that users could be categorized into four groups based on their privacy concerns related to Facebook’s data collection practices, objectives for controlling their ad experience, and willingness to engage with advertising controls. Our findings provide a set of user requirements for advertising controls, applicable to Facebook as well as other platforms, that would better align such controls with consumers’ needs and expectations.",

In two distinct cultures (United States and Portugal) we examined group-based emotions toward robots with participants self-categorizing three different ways (ingroup, outgroup, and neutral). We tested and confirmed our baseline assumptions that Portuguese participants are more collectivistic and less individualistic, and feel closer with a team in negative, but not positive, scenarios, compared to United States participants. Supporting our hypotheses, the results showed that participants rated more positive emotions toward the robot in the ingroup condition than in the outgroup or neutral conditions. Moreover, an interaction effect between culture and self-categorization revealed that Portuguese participants had more positive group-based emotions toward the robot than United States participants when self-categorizing as an ingroup. We discuss the implications in terms of human-robot teaming and potential future research directions.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, studies on the user experience have emerged as an indispensable part of any gamification research. The study of user experience enables gamification designers and practitioners to design or adapt their gamification schemes in a more knowledgeable and efficacious manner. However, one popular gamification scheme that has largely remained under-researched in terms of user experience is \"promotional gamification,\" which refers to an optional and time-limited gamification program that usually mounts an already gamified platform to increase user incentive and engagement for a short span of time (e.g., during the holiday season). The current study undertakes the first steps necessary to explore users' experiences of working with a promotional gamification scheme in a large-scale online community. To this end, we conduct an extensive qualitative case study of users' experiences with a promotional gamification scheme on the Community Question Answering (CQA) website of Stack Exchange, called Winter Bash (WB). Notably, the purpose of WB is to operate as a makeshift solution that prevents the decline in user contributions during the holiday season. However, like many other gamification schemes, WB is not devoid of issues, and our research helps identify those issues without overlooking the WB's strengths. Our study denotes not only the first (empirical) typology of users' affective responses to promotional gamification schemes but also the first classification of motivational factors involved in user engagement. At its core, this study comprises two salient parts: (1) a content analysis of user-generated data regarding WB (from the past eight years), and (2) a series of semi-structured interviews with 17 international users who are familiar with WB. We triangulate our findings from (1) and (2) by performing a similar content analysis for two other promotional gamification schemes, namely \"Answerathon\" (from Travel Meta) and \"Discussion Tournament\" (from Reddit). Based on the findings of this study, we present certain guidelines for gamification designers and practitioners, enabling them to either deploy or adapt their promotional gamification schemes in a more knowledgeable and effective manner. Finally, our work is concluded by highlighting a few novel research opportunities for researchers invested in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW).",

      "abstract": "The World Wide Web is dominated by big tech and seemingly endless scandals after a decade of growing distrust about the role technology and the Internet play in our society. As a result, there are calls for the creation of alternatives to the existing platforms and infrastructures. One such alternative is a decentralized web (DWeb) where users have control of their data and decisions. This paper presents a collectively-produced organizational autoethnography of the development of an emerging tool for publishing on the decentralized web and the magazine using it to contribute to the digital commons. Three key themes emerged: 1) how a commons-based understanding of boundaries supports participation in a broader ecosystem; 2) the ways commoning as a frame deepens engagement as opposed to a passive model of a digital commons platform; finally 3) the need to re-assess how a cohort lab model that structured the work feeds back into larger goals. From these findings, we reflect on how this project fits into a maturing DWeb ecosystem and what possibilities for social transformation are present in transitional forms of commons. We discuss the pressing need for CSCW and adjacent research communities to participate in the design of, and debates over, the new computing paradigms developing out of this wave of decentralized technologies.",

      "abstract": "We investigate how collaboration is understood and configured in industrial workplaces with collaborative robots (cobots). Through a qualitative analysis of 115 case studies of companies using cobots and 14 semi-structured interviews with cobot manufacturers and users, we examine the usages of cobots in the manufacturing industry over the entire temporal spectrum from pre-introduction to completed implementation. By synthesizing diverse stakeholders' perspectives, we present a set of main findings; key roles of a few supportive production workers during the adoption of cobots; a fragmentation of work tasks and the resulting loss of job identity among workers; the disunified meaning of  ``collaboration'' which is under constant development; and the collaborative space and the working rhythms between production workers and cobots. By reconsidering what collaboration means in the workplace with cobots, we propose the concept of \\textit{bounded collaboration}, which means that the anticipated collaboration is manifested in a partial and limited manner within a collaborative technology. Finally, we provide practical suggestions for examining and supporting organizations and users in their adoption of cobots.",

      "abstract": "Working from home has become common practice for many, especially since the global pandemic has forced many office workers to relocate their work spaces to a home environment. While working from home can have benefits, it requires self-discipline and can be a challenge to stay motivated. Changes in motivation about work may impact people's sense of productivity and well-being. We used a mixed-methods study using diaries and interviews with 25 informants to investigate perceived challenges during remote work from home. A grounded theory analysis revealed that people's work motivation had shifted from being people-centric to being work-centric. In the office, informants were motivated by working and interacting with others and being at their desk signaled work engagement to others. At home, motivation was mainly driven by personal work responsibilities. We identify four clusters of worker strategies to address the shift in work motivation. While some informants' perspectives on motivation made them reflect inward on their work performance and enjoyment, other informants' perspectives were outward-facing and involved performance and enjoyment in relation to others. We conclude that there needs to be better support for sustaining work motivation at home that can be tailored to different individuals, specifically in terms of managing time and detaching from work. We conclude by considering new pathways for supporting remote work.",

      "abstract": "Research on public speaking has recently made a fair progress within the CSCW scholarship that mostly focuses on training the speakers to gain popularity. Core to this research is the idea of a universal set of skills that makes a public speech successful in terms of popularity. However, a strand of research has also shown skepticism to their simplistic conceptualization of the speaking context. We join this discussion by presenting a mix of qualitative and quantitative analyses of Islamic preaching videos on YouTube. These videos are created from Islamic sermons -- a form of Islamic religious public speaking in Bangladesh. By exploring the topics of discussion by the preachers and by analyzing the performances of the preachers during the sermons, we demonstrate how those are situated in their social, political, and religious context. Based on our findings, we discuss how the public speaking scholarship of CSCW and related fields could benefit from studying such public speeches in non-secular contexts of the Global South. Further, we discuss how the role of such religious sermons could contribute to the development discourse within CSCW. ",

      "abstract": "Public defenders, lawyers assigned to people accused of crimes who can not afford a private attorney, serve as an essential bulwark against wrongful arrest and incarceration for low-income and marginalized people. Public defenders have long been overworked and under-resourced, however these issues have been compounded by boosts in the volume and complexity of data in modern criminal defense cases. We explore the technology needs of public defenders through a series of semi-structured interviews with public defenders and the people who work with them. We find that public defenders' ability to reason about novel surveillance data is woefully inadequate not only due to a lack of resources and knowledge, but also due to the structure of the criminal justice system, which gives prosecutors and police (in partnership with private companies) far more control than defense attorneys over the type of information used in criminal cases. We found that public defenders may be able to create fairer situations for their clients with more data access and better tools for data interpretation. Therefore, we call on technologists to keep the potential future needs of public defenders and the people they represent in mind when designing systems that collect data about people. Our findings illuminate constraints that technologists and privacy advocates should consider as they pursue solutions, for instance our work complicates notions of individual privacy as the only value in protecting users' rights and demonstrates the importance's of data interpretation along side data visibility. As data sources become more complex, control over the data cannot be separated from access to experts and technology who can make sense of it. The growing surveillance data ecosystem may systematically oppress not only those who are most closely observed, but groups of people whose communities and advocates have been deprived of the storytelling power over their information.

      "abstract": "Sustainable Open Source Software (OSS) forms much of the fabric of our digital society, especially successful and sustainable ones. But many OSS projects do not become sustainable, resulting in abandonment and even risks for the world's digital infrastructure. Prior work has looked at the reasons for this mainly from two very different perspectives. In software engineering, the focus has been on understanding success and sustainability from the socio-technical perspective: the OSS programmers' day-to-day activities and the artifacts they create. In institutional analysis, on the other hand, emphasis has been on institutional designs (e.g., policies, rules, and norms) that structure project governance. Even though each is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of OSS projects, the connection and interaction between the two approaches have been barely explored. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we make the first effort toward understanding OSS project sustainability using a dual-view analysis, by combining institutional analysis with socio-technical systems analysis. In particular, we (i) use linguistic approaches to extract institutional rules and norms from OSS contributors' communications to represent the evolution of their governance systems, and (ii) construct socio-technical networks based on longitudinal collaboration records to represent each project's organizational structure. We combined the two methods and applied them to a dataset of developer digital traces from 253 nascent OSS projects within the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) incubator. We find that the socio-technical and institutional features relate to each other, and provide complimentary views into the progress of the ASF's OSS projects. Refining these combined analyses can help provide a more precise understanding of the synchronization between the evolution of institutional governance and organizational structure. ",

Thus, the members and admins of the groups together grow\r\na sensibility of sovereignty within the community on Facebook. While the imagined sovereignty in Facebook\r\ngroups is empowering, this empowerment may not be perceived and experienced evenly by everyone in\r\nsuch online communities. To explain this, we build on the concept of ‘Imagined Communities’ by Benedict\r\nAnderson [16] and argue that there is a tension between Facebook admins’ perceived sovereignty and other\r\nusers’ empowerment in practice. Our work joins the body of CSCW literature that aims at designing more\r\nsustainable and collaborative tools for specific communities on Facebook groups and other similar platforms.",

      "abstract": "Video-meetings essentially determine remote work life. However, video-meetings experience challenges originating from human emotions. Therefore, emotional competence, the ability to perceive, understand, and regulate emotions, is of the highest relevance. With limited transfer capacity of emotional information and various communication challenges, developing emotional competence, however, is complex. To overcome this complexity, we present TeamSpiritous, an individual, retrospective emotional competence development system for video-meetings. TeamSpiritous allows to upload and analyze recorded video-meetings on emotional processes and provides support for individual development of emotional competence.\r\n \r\n We evaluated TeamSpiritous quantitatively and qualitatively in a six-week, longitudinal field study with 47 participants from China and Germany. Results of our study show that intra- and interpersonal emotional competence significantly increased over time for the whole sample. In particular, intrapersonal emotion regulation and interpersonal emotion perception and understanding improved.",

      "abstract": "In online group discussions, balanced participation can improve the quality of discussion, members’ satisfaction, and positive group dynamics. One approach to achieve balanced participation is to deploy a conversational agent (CA) that encourages participation of under-contributing members, and it is important to design communication strategies of the CA in a way that is supportive to the group. We implemented five communication strategies that a CA can use during a decision-making task in a small group synchronous chat discussion. The five strategies include messages sent to two types of recipients (@username vs. @everyone) crossed by two separate channels (public vs. private), and a peer-mediated strategy where the CA asks a peer to address the under-contributing member. Through an online study with 42 groups, we measured the balance of participation and perceptions about the CA by analyzing chat logs and survey responses. We found that the CA sending messages specifying an individual through a private channel is the most effective and preferred way to increase participation of under-contributing members. Participants also expressed that the peer-mediated strategy is a less intrusive and less embarrassing way of receiving the CA's messages compared to the conventional approach where the CA directly sends a message to the under-contributing member. Based on our findings, we discuss trade-offs of various communication strategies and explain design considerations for building an effective CA that adapts to different group dynamics and situations.",

      "abstract": "During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global health crisis, institutions, policymakers, and academics alike have called for practicing resilience to overcome its ongoing disruptions. This paper contributes a comparative study of the job search experiences of working-class and upper-middle-class job seekers, particularly in relation to their resilience practices during the pandemic. We draw from interviews with 12 working-class and 11 upper-middle-class job seekers in the U.S. We unpack challenges resulting from both the pandemic and unemployment and job seekers' novel practices of navigating these challenges in their everyday disrupted life, highlighting the similarities and differences across classes. Job seekers' ongoing negotiation with their resources, situations, and surroundings gives practical meanings to building everyday resilience, which we conceptualize as an ongoing process of becoming resilient. We found that job seekers across classes experienced similar challenges. However, working-class job seekers took on additional emotional labor in their everyday resilience due to their limited experience in the digital job search space, competition with higher-degree holding job seekers applying for the same jobs, limited social support networks, and at times, isolation. By foregrounding the uneven distribution of emotional labor in realizing the promise of resilience along class lines, this work cautions against the romanticization of resilience and calls for a more critical understanding of resilience in CSCW.",

      "abstract": "Group decision making occurs when individuals collectively choose from a set of alternatives based on individual preferences. In these ubiquitous situations, it can be helpful for decision makers to visually model and compare stakeholder preferences in order to better understand others' points of view and reach consensus. Although a number of collaboration support tools allow preference inspection in some form, they are rarely based on a comprehensive understanding of the needs of group decision makers. The goal of our work is to study these demands, develop abstractions to model them, and create a framework to inform the design and assessment of existing and future tools. First, guided by decision analysis theory, we examine a diverse set of group decision making scenarios, characterizing variations in problem formulation, analysis goals, and situational features. Second, we amalgamate these findings into data and task abstractions that can be used to relate specific scenarios to the language of visualization. Finally, we use this framework to assess existing preference visualization tools in order to shed light on areas for future work in supporting group decision making.",

      "abstract": "We introduce Friendscope, an instant, in-the-moment experience sharing system for lightweight commercial camera glasses. Friendscope explores a new concept called a shared camera. This concept allows a wearer to share control of their camera with a remote friend, making it possible for both people to capture photos/videos from the camera in the moment. Through a user study with 48 participants, we found that users felt connected to each other, describing the shared camera as a more intimate form of livestreaming. Moreover, even privacy-sensitive users were able to retain their sense of privacy and control with the shared camera. Friendscope’s different shared camera configurations give wearers ultimate control over who they share the camera with and what photos/videos they share. We conclude with design implications for future experience sharing systems.",

      "abstract": "A growing number of organizations are hiring autistic individuals as they start to recognize the value of a neurodiverse workforce. Despite this trend, the lack of support for autistic employees in workplaces complicates their employment. However, little is known about how people around autistic individuals can support them to create pleasant work experiences. In this work, we develop the concept of the Workplace Playbook VR to investigate how virtual reality (VR) can help autistic people develop their work-related social communication skills in partnership with people in their support network. Using a video prototype that presents the concept, we interviewed 28 participants, including 10 autistic people and 18 members of their support networks, which included family members and professionals. Our interviews revealed that the Workplace Playbook VR program can provide common ground for autistic people and members of their support network to participate in more empathetic communication regarding workplace challenges. Despite the benefits, we identified the potential misuse of social communication skills training features of the VR program to correct the personal characteristics of autistic individuals. Furthermore, to cultivate inclusive workplace environments, we found the needs of VR development not only for autistic people but also for neurotypical employees to promote their understanding of autism and empathy toward autistic employees. We suggest VR designs that promote a sense of agency and self-advocacy for autistic employees, and autism awareness and acceptance training for neurotypical employees.",

      "abstract": "There is an increasing amount of work studying fairness in socio-technical settings from a computational perspective. In this context, a variety of metrics have been introduced to measure fairness in different settings. Most of these metrics, however, do not account for the interactions between individuals or evaluate any underlying network's effect on the outcomes measured. While a wide body of work studies the organization of individuals into a network structure and how individuals access resources in networks, the impact of network structure on fairness has been largely unexplored. We introduce templates for group fairness metrics that account for network structure. More specifically, we present two types of group fairness metrics that measure distinct yet complementary forms of bias in networks. The first type of metric evaluates how access to others in the network is distributed across groups. The second type of metric evaluates how groups distribute their interactions across other groups, and hence captures inter-group biases. We find that ignoring the network can lead to spurious fairness evaluations by either not capturing imbalances in influence and reach illuminated by the first type of metric, or by overlooking interaction biases as evaluated by the second type of metric. Our empirical study illustrates these pronounced differences between network and non-network evaluations of fairness.",

      "abstract": "Adopting new psychological strategies to improve mental wellness can be challenging since people are often unable to anticipate how new habits are applicable to their circumstances. Narrative-based interventions have the potential to alleviate this burden by illustrating psychological principles in an applied context. In this work, we explore how stories can be delivered via the ubiquitous and scalable medium of text messaging. Through formative work consisting of interviews and focus group discussions with 15 participants, we identified desirable elements of stories about mental health, including authenticity and relatability. We then deployed story-based text messages to 42 participants to explore challenges regarding both the stories' content (e.g., specific versus generalized) and format (e.g., story length). We observed that our stories helped participants reflect on and identify flaws in their thinking patterns. Our findings highlight design implications and opportunities for mental wellness interventions that utilize stories in text messaging services.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Although informal online learning communities have proliferated over the last two decades, a fundamental question remains: What are the users of these communities expected to learn? Guided by the work of Etienne Wenger on communities of practice, we identify three distinct types of learning goals common to online informal learning communities: the development of domain skills, the development of identity as a community member, and the development of community-specific values and practices. Given these goals, what is the best way to support learning? Drawing from previous research in social computing, we ask how different types of legitimate peripheral participation by newcomers—contribution to core tasks, engagement with practice proxies, social bonding, and feedback exchange—may be associated with these three learning goals. Using data from the Scratch online community, we conduct a quantitative analysis to explore these questions. Our study contributes both theoretical insights and empirical evidence on how different types of learning occur in informal online environments. ",

      "abstract": "With the emergence of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), people are being exposed to an increased volume of crime-related information, which induces fear. While the fear of crime has been explored around people’s experiences with crime, little is known about how people frame their conversations about crime online. In this study, we explore how citizens talk about crime on Reddit. By collecting crime conversations from the subreddit r/baltimore, we find that, on the surface, redditors discuss topics such as comparing crime rates in Baltimore with other cities in an effort to destigmatize the depictions of Baltimore as a city rife with crime. On a deeper level, we find that through their conversations about crime, redditors are engaging in discourse frames that both re-enforce and fight against platformed racism. On the one hand, some redditors perpetuate racially coded language that is rife with anti-Black stereotypes, framing their conversations using old and new racism to cover their racism and discrimination against Black people. On the other hand, others push back against platformed racism by drawing attention to individual racism and systemic racism, and situating crime in root, societal causes. We then discuss how platformed racism operates in online conversations, and develop the concepts of weaponized identity and digital gentrification, which we argue are ways in which people, through their engagements in digital platforms, continue to perpetuate white hegemonic power structures in society. Finally, we discuss implications for how to design to support the fight against platformed racism in sociotechnical systems like Reddit. As a content note and warning, this paper discusses racist content which may be upsetting or harmful to some readers.",

      "abstract": "Online political arguments have a reputation for being futile exchanges, partially because people often respond more punitively to those who do not share their views, a phenomenon called ingroup bias. We explore how ingroup bias affects political disagreements online, and how respect can mitigate its effects. Towards this goal, we conducted an experiment on Twitter systematically varying respectful versus neutral language across people who did and did not share views. We found that people who do not share views are most likely to reply to disagreements, and neutral disagreements generated more discussions than respectful disagreements. However, we also found that using respectful language reduces shaming responses overall, and reduces the effects of ingroup bias across conversations with people who do and do not share views. We conclude with recommendations to promote respectful language on social media and build shame resiliency online, such as through design that encourages thoughtful engagement, and a peer support network that allows users to share shame experiences online.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly present in many family homes, yet it is unclear precisely how well families understand the cyber security threats and risks of using such devices, and how possible it is for them to educate themselves on these topics. Using a survey of 553 parents and interviews with 25 families in the UK, we find that families do not consider home IoT devices to be significantly different in terms of threats than more traditional home computers, and believe the major risks to be largely mitigated through consumer protection regulation. As a result, parents focus on teaching being careful with devices to prolong device life use, exposing their families to additional security risks and modeling incorrect security behaviors to their children. This is a risk for the present and also one for the future, as children are not taught about the IoT, and appropriate cyber security management of such devices, at school. We go on to suggest that steps must be taken by manufacturers and governments or appropriate trusted institutions to improve the cyber security knowledge and behaviors of both adults and children in relation to the use of home IoT devices.",

      "abstract": "Working remotely from home during the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant shifts and disruptions in the personal and work lives of millions of information workers and their teams. We examined how sleep patterns---an important component of mental and physical health---relates to teamwork. We used wearable sensing and daily questionnaires to examine sleep patterns, affect, and perceptions of teamwork in 71 information workers from 22 teams over a ten-week period. Participants reported delays in sleep onset and offset as well as longer sleep duration during the pandemic. A similar shift was found in work schedules, though total work hours did not change significantly. Surprisingly, we found that more sleep was negatively related to positive affect and perceptions of teamwork and team productivity. However, a greater misalignment in the sleep patterns of members in a team predicted positive affect and teamwork after accounting for individual differences in sleep preferences. A qualitative analysis of interviews suggests that a greater misalignment in sleep may lead team members to have more or better teamwork. We discuss implications of sleep and sleep misalignment in work-from-home contexts with an eye for applying insights towards how sleep data may be leveraged to facilitate remote teamwork.",

However, women around the world experience online harassment, including insults, stalking, non-consensual sharing of sexual photos, and aggression. This article explores women's perceptions of harm associated with online harassment and preferred platform responses to that harm. We conducted a survey in 14 geographic regions around the world (N=3,993), including regions whose perspectives have been insufficiently elevated in social media governance decisions (e.g., Mongolia, Cameroon). Results show that, on average, women perceive greater harm associated with online harassment than men, especially for non-consensual image sharing. Women also prefer most platform responses, especially removing content and banning users, but are less favorable towards payment. Compared to men, women prefer banning users, revealing identity of perpetrators, and labeling content. We reflect on the importance of centering the experiences of people harmed when designing platform responses, as well as the complexity of justice models when considering gender.",

      "abstract": "Crowd-powered conversational systems (CPCS) are gaining considerable attention for their potential utility in a variety of application domains, for which automated conversational interfaces are still too limited. CPCS currently suffer from long response delays, which hampers their potential as conversational partners. The majority of prior work in this area has focused on demonstrating the feasibility of the approach and improving performance, while evaluation studies have primarily focused on  response latency and ways to reduce it. Relatively little is currently known about how response delays in a CPCS can affect  user experience. While the importance of reducing response latency is widely recognized in the broader field of human-computer interaction, little attention has been paid to how response quality, response delay, conversational context, and the complexity of the task affect how users experience the conversation, and how they perceive waiting for responses in particular. We conducted a  between-subjects experiment (N = 478), to examine the influence of these four factors on the overall waiting experience of users. Results show that users 1) evaluated the waiting experience more negatively when the response delay was longer than 8 seconds, 2) underestimated the elapsed time but experienced more frustration in tasks with high complexity, 3) underestimated the elapsed time and experienced less frustration with high quality bot’s utterances, 4) judged response delays to be slightly longer, and experienced more frustration in an emotion-centric CPCS compared to a task-centric CPCS. Our insights can inform the design of future CPCSs with regards to defining performance requirements and anticipating their potential impact on the user experience they can facilitate.",

      "abstract": "Systems involving artificial intelligence (AI) are protagonists in many everyday activities. Moreover, designers are increasingly implementing these systems for groups of users in various social and cooperative domains. Unfortunately, research on personalized recommendation systems often reports negative experiences due to a lack of diversity, control, or transparency. Providing a meta-analysis of the interaction design strategies for group recommendation systems (GRS) offers designers and practitioners a departure to address these issues and imagine new interaction possibilities for this context. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the ACM, IEEE, and Scopus digital libraries to identify GRS interface designs, resulting in a final corpus of 142 academic papers. After a systematic coding process, we used descriptive statistics and thematic analysis to uncover the current state of the art regarding interaction design strategies for GRS in six areas: (1) application domains; (2) devices chosen to implement the systems; (3) prototype fidelity; (4) strategies for profile transparency, justification, control, and diversity; (5) strategies for group formation and final group consensus; and, (6) evaluation methods applied in user studies during the design process. Based on our findings, we present an exhaustive typology of interaction design strategies for GRS and a set of research opportunities to foster human-centered interfaces for personalized recommendations in cooperative and social computing contexts.",

      "abstract": "Machine Translation (MT) has been a very useful tool to assist multilingual communication and collaboration. In recent years, by taking advantage of the exciting developments of neural networks and deep learning, the accuracy and speed of machine translation have been continuously improved. However, most machine translation methods and systems are data-driven. They tend to select a consensus response represented in training data, while a user's preferred linguistic style, which is important for translation comprehension and user experience, is ignored. For this problem, we aim to build a user-oriented personalized machine translation model in this paper. The model aims to learn each user's linguistic style from the textual content that is generated by her/him (User-Generated Textual Content, UGTC) in social media context and generate personalized translation results utilizing several state-of-the-art deep learning techniques like Transformer and pre-training. We also implemented a user-oriented personalized machine translator using Weibo as a case of the source of UGTC to provide a systematical implementation scheme of a user-oriented personalized machine translation system based on our model. The translator was evaluated by automatic evaluation in combination with human evaluation. The results suggest that our model can generate more personalized, natural and lively translation results and enhance the comprehensibility of translation results, which makes its generations more preferred by users versus general translation results.",

      "abstract": "Little is known about whether and how workers with disabilities participate in the many on-demand labor platforms that make up the growing gig economy, yet, this understanding is a vital step towards developing a more inclusive gig economy. Through interviews with 24 workers and observational fieldwork, we present a rich, in-depth picture of the opportunities and challenges presented by four main types of gig work (ridesharing, delivery, crowdwork, and freelancing) for workers with a wide range of disabilities. We identify a key tension: gig work can be a vital source of needed income for workers who have been excluded from traditional workplaces, but at the same time, the structure of gig platforms present workers with a host of new disability-related challenges, including around algorithmic control and performance evaluation. We discuss how this tension plays out in terms of how workers engage in gig work and protect themselves from risk. We also call attention to how many workers can face complicated, intersectional challenges based on multiple, marginalized identities in addition to disability, such as race, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. Our work contributes to research on the gig economy by centering the perspectives of workers who are marginalized based on disability and other identities. We show how workers face several penalties based on disability, including shouldering extensive invisible labor to mitigate the challenges they face. To address these issues, we represent workers' voices in the design suggestions we put forth around how labor platforms could be more inclusive and equitable for workers with a range of disabilities.",

      "abstract": "The rise of big data and smart sensing, with the promise of more educated and informed decisions, has fuelled a shift towards more data-driven decision-making in local and national government. However, we are observing a disconnect between the people who are affected by these decisions and their access to tools and resources to collect data in order to provide the needed evidence for change. To truly democratise this process and for citizens to become active prosumers of data, new mechanisms of citizen data production are needed. In this paper we report on a two-year ethnographic and iterative co-design process with the local community. This work encompassed the design, development and deployment of SenseMyStreet (SeMS), a bespoke sensor commissioning toolkit that enables citizens and community groups to use and commission a city's scientific-grade environmental monitors, determining where they will be located on their streets and collecting data to evidence hyper-local issues. Unlike prior research, which creates alternative data sources to contest city data, our toolkit helps integrate citizen commissioned data into the city datasets used by citizens and decision-makers. Reflecting on the design process and evaluating the ways people engaged with the digital tools of the toolkit, we highlight how commissioning can be configured to promote equity in the smart city, empower citizens to take ownership of issues and facilitate the creation of community networks that utilise the data for local benefit.",

      "abstract": "Version control systems are powerful tools for managing history information and shaping personal and collaborative processes.  While many complex tools exist for software engineering, and basic functionality for capturing versions is often found in collaborative applications such as text editors and design layout tools, these systems are not attuned to the needs and behaviors of creative practitioners within those domains, and fail to support creative practitioners in many others. Through 18 semi-structured interviews across diverse domains of creativity, we investigate how creative practitioners use version histories in their process. With the familiar paradigms and features of software version control as an organizing structure, we discuss how these creative practitioners embrace, challenge, and complicate uses of version histories in four ways: using versions as a palette of materials, providing confidence and freedom to explore, leveraging low-fidelity version capture, and reflecting on and reusing versions across long time scales. We discuss how the themes present across this wide range of mediums and domains can provide insight into future designs and uses of version control systems to support creative process. ",

      "abstract": "Online peer-to-peer therapy sessions can be effective in improving people's mental well-being. However, online volunteer counselors may lack the expertise and necessary training to provide high-quality sessions, and these low-quality sessions may negatively impact volunteers' motivations as well as clients' well-being. This paper uses interviews with 20 senior online volunteer counselors to examine how they addressed challenges and acquired skills when volunteering in a large, mental-health support community - 7Cups.com. Although volunteers in this community received some training based on principles of active listening and motivational interviewing, results indicate that the training was insufficient and that volunteer counselors had to independently develop strategies to deal with specific challenges that they encountered in their volunteer work. Their strategies, however, might deviate from standard practice since they generally lacked systematic feedback from mentors or clients and, instead, relied on their personal experiences. Additionally, volunteer counselors reported having difficulty maintaining their professional boundaries with the clients. Even though training and support resources were available, they were underutilized. The results of this study have uncovered new design spaces for HCI practitioners and researchers, including social computing and artificial intelligence approaches that may provide better support to volunteer counselors in online mental health communities.

      "abstract": "When a child is hospitalized with a serious illness, their family members must process emotional stress, quickly absorb complicated clinical information, and take on new caregiving tasks. They also have to coordinate with each other and with other family caregivers without abandoning existing work and home life responsibilities. Previous CSCW and HCI research has shown how the patient’s experience changes across the illness journey, but less is known about the effect of this journey on family caregivers and their coordination work. CSCW technologies could support and augment family care coordination work across the journey, reducing stress levels and improving families’ ability to stay connected and informed. In this paper, we report findings from an interview study we conducted with 14 parents of children undergoing extended hospitalization for cancer treatment. We propose the concept of caregiving coordination journeys and describe caregivers’ current communication and coordination practices across different phases of the hospitalization journey, from diagnosis and early hospitalization to extended hospitalization and beyond. We characterize families’ caregiving coordination routines across different time scales, and describe the current role of communication technologies in families’ coordination practices. We then propose design opportunities for social computing technologies to support and augment families’ communication and caregiving work during the hospitalization journey of their child.  ",

      "abstract": "As global rates of anxiety and depression increase, we observe millions of downloads of mobile apps addressing mental health that adopt ‘freemium’ charging models offering complex combinations of free and paid features. We explore potentially negative outcomes of deploying such freemium designs to vulnerable MH populations. We assess outcomes for 41 frequently downloaded mental health apps, by combining thematic analysis of 41K user reviews with audits to validate app descriptions and reviews. We propose a new analytic framework identifying three types of negative outcomes for freemium deployments: first vulnerable users currently experiencing crises may feel pressure to download unhelpful or costly apps. Second unintuitive descriptions of complex apps can lead to inappropriate treatments and expensive subscriptions. Third, limited duration offers may result in incomplete treatments or unexpected charges.  We discuss ethical considerations and broader HCI consequences. We describe implications for mental health app design, including the need for greater transparency around free versus paid features, and propose new approaches to provide vulnerable users with validated information about these commonly downloaded apps.

      "abstract": "Social robots have the potential to augment the care provided to older adults in residential aged care homes. However, social robots can only be of value in aged care if care staff perceive them as valuable and incorporate them successfully into their ongoing care practices beyond a limited research period. This study examines the benefits and challenges of using different types of social robots in real-world practice from the care staff perspective. We conducted semi-structured interviews with eleven staff members who have first-hand experience of employing robots in their work. Our findings highlight the entangled relationships among the actors in the older adult/carer/robot triad. We discuss the role of robots in supporting a mutually beneficial relationship between care staff and older adults, and how robopets and humanoid robots impact care staff in different ways. Finally, we offer recommendations for the future deployment of robots. We argue that a successful and sustainable deployment of robots in care practice might involve recognizing and promoting positive impacts for both the human parties in the triad, and that the practice of using robots needs to align with the needs and interests of both caregivers and care recipients.",

To build an agent that can handle users' information needs in this domain, we must first understand the types of assistance that users desire when working on their documents. In this work, we present results from two user studies that characterize the information needs and queries of authors, reviewers, and readers of business documents. In the first study, we used experience sampling to collect users’ questions in-situ as they were working with their documents, and in the second, we built a human-in-the-loop document Q&A system which rendered assistance with a variety of users' questions. Our results have implications for the design of document assistants that complement AI with human intelligence including whether particular skillsets or roles within the document are needed from human respondents, as well as the challenges around such systems.",

      "abstract": "To deal with a spontaneous civil uprising following a substantial rise in gas prices, the Iranian security apparatus imposed techno-political measures in late 2019, blocking access to international websites and services. To analyze these measures, we conducted 19 interviews with Iranians living inside and outside the country. We argue that the picture of the shutdown, as portrayed in Western media, does not accurately describe the infrastructural restrictions and propose an analysis based on the concept of an internet nationalization. This paper offers an in-depth analysis of what the nationalization meant and how it affected the lives of Iranians participating or not participating in the protests. We also report on a variety of creative measures, both technical and non-technical, Iranians took to counter-appropriate the government-imposed shutdown of international connectivity. Based on these data, we elaborate on the concept of counter-appropriation.",

Drawing on 29 queer social VR users’ experiences across various countries and cultures, we identify three main strategies for building and experiencing embodied visibility in social VR, limitations of each strategy, and impacts of such visibility on queer users’ identity practices online and offline. We broaden current studies on queer visibility online and expand the traditional lens of selective visibility by highlighting how embodiment both supports and challenges the multidimensional online presentation of queer identity. We also propose potential design considerations to further support diverse queer users’ visibility in social VR and inform future directions for creating inclusive online social experiences.",

      "abstract": "When working together, people frequently share information with each other to enable division of labour, assistance, and delegation of responsibility. The literature has explored both synchronous and asynchronous transfer techniques, known as Handoff and Deposit, respectively. However, current cross-device environments tend to only provide a single mechanism. Moreover, we have little understanding of the impact of different techniques on collaborative process. To understand how Handoff and Deposit may be designed to support complex sensemaking tasks, we followed a Research through Design process to iteratively design Handoff and Deposit techniques using paper and digital sketches and high-fidelity prototypes. We consulted the HCI literature to corroborate our findings with studies and descriptions of existing cross-device transfer designs and to understand the potential impact of those designs on mixed-focus collaboration. We learned that as we move away from a restricted physical workspace and leverage the flexibility of digital personal devices, there is a large design space for realizing cross-device transfer. To inform these designs, we provide five design considerations for cross-device transfer techniques: Transfer Acceptance, Action Dependencies, Immediate Usability, Interruption Potential, and Connection Actions.",

      "abstract": "Many online communities rely on postpublication moderation where contributors---even those that are perceived as being risky---are allowed to publish material immediately without review. An alternative arrangement involves moderating content before publication. A range of communities have argued against prepublication moderation by suggesting that it makes contributing less enjoyable for new members and that it will distract established community members with extra moderation work. We present an empirical analysis of the effects of a prepublication review system called FlaggedRevs that was deployed by several Wikipedia language editions. We used panel data from 17 large Wikipedia editions to test a series of hypotheses related to the effect of the system on activity levels and contribution quality within the affected communities. We found that the system was very effective at keeping low-quality contributions from ever becoming visible. Although there is some evidence that the system discouraged participation among unregistered users, our analysis suggests that the system's effects on contribution volume and quality were moderate at most. Our findings imply that concerns regarding the major negative effects of prepublication moderation systems on contribution quality, project productivity, and community sustainability may be overstated.",

      "abstract": "One of the key emerging roles of the YouTube platform is providing creators the ability to generate revenue from their content and interactions. Alongside tools provided directly by the platform, such as revenue-sharing from advertising, creators co-opt the platform to use a variety of off-platform monetization opportunities. In this work, we focus on studying and characterizing these alternative monetization strategies. Leveraging a large longitudinal YouTube dataset of popular creators, we develop a taxonomy of alternative monetization strategies and a simple methodology to automatically detect their usage. We then proceed to characterize the adoption of these strategies. First, we find that the use of external monetization is expansive and increasingly prevalent, used in 18% of all videos, with 61% of channels using one such strategy at least once. Second, we show that the adoption of these strategies varies substantially among channels of different kinds and popularity, and that channels that establish these alternative revenue streams often become more productive on the platform. Lastly, we investigate how potentially problematic channels -- those that produce Alt-lite, Alt-right, and Manosphere content -- leverage alternative monetization strategies, finding that they employ a more diverse set of such strategies significantly more often than a carefully chosen comparison set of channels. This finding complicates YouTube’s role as a gatekeeper, since the practice of excluding policy-violating content from its native on-platform monetization may not be effective. Overall, this work provides an important step towards broadening the understanding of the monetary incentives behind content creation on YouTube. \r\n",

Existing tools for family memories often take a techno-determinist approach by focusing on the mechanics of connecting families and the resulting documentation, rather than the social process of sharing stories and morals, and largely without considering the specific needs of immigrant families. For immigrant families, cultural exchange, particularly crucial across grandparent and grandchild generations, is threatened by the language and cultural barriers emerging from displacement and migration. As a result, immigrant grandparents and their young grandchildren struggle with fostering social kinship, leading to social disconnect and loss of cultural heritage. In our research, we collaborate with multi-generational and culturally-at-risk immigrant families through Participatory Design activities towards the design of reminiscence tools that support their needs focusing on language and cultural connection. We report on the designs created by families and propose design guidelines supporting cultural resilience, focusing on flexible, visual storytelling.",

While prior human-computer interaction studies largely focus on understanding techno-spiritual practices in both personal and ministry environments, there is a lack of design research that explores novel design opportunities, based on longitudinal field deployment. As an important techno-spiritual practice, this work focuses on scripture reading and investigates the design space of \"social scripture reading,\" as it is often organized into small groups for successful behavior maintenance. We designed and evaluated BibleCell, a social scripture reading tool that supports personalized reading plans, scripture reading, and social sharing. After the third year of deployment, we performed a two-month user study in Korean Protestant churches to deepen our understanding of techno-spiritual practices in social contexts via in-depth interviews (n = 27). We report the major themes of social techno-spiritual practices, such as social motivators, social interaction patterns, and leadership roles. We discuss our findings using a novel design concept of social-spiritual awareness that considers both the social and spiritual aspects of interactions in social computing systems.",

      "abstract": "Open source software represents an important form of digital infrastructure as well as a pathway to technical careers for many developers, but women are drastically underrepresented in this setting. Although there is a good body of literature on open source participation, there is very little understanding of the participation trajectories and contribution experiences of women developers, and how they compare to those of men\r\ndevelopers, in open source software projects. In this study, we conducted a set of interviews with 23 developers, 11 men and 12 women, who became core in an open source project in order to understand their joining and participation motivations. We identify differences in women and men’s motivations f r initial contributions and sustained involvement in a project. We also describe unique negative experiences faced by women contributors in this setting in each stage of participation. Our results have implications for diversifying participation in open source software and understanding open source as a pathway to technical careers.",

      "abstract": "360-degree videos hold great potential as learning tools that can provide a sense of presence with instructors. However, much remains to be explored about how these videos should be designed. Across three within-subjects studies, we compared the effects of two different narrative styles, monologue and dialogue, on learning experiences in 360-degree videos filmed in an apple orchard. Study 1 presented the 360-degree videos using virtual reality (VR) with head-mounted displays. Study 2 presented the same content in web-based VR using computer screens. Replicating Study 2, Study 3 further examined users' interaction with the video content using on-screen mouse tracking. Across all three studies, participants preferred a monologue format, and also reported higher physical and social presence in this format. Furthermore, greater physical presence correlated with improved recall of informative content. This suggests that many of the benefits of 360-degree videos can be enjoyed even by students and teachers without access to VR headsets, providing more inclusive and accessible learning opportunities.",

      "abstract": "Emerging techniques developed by AI researchers promise to offer the capacity to support disaster risk management (DRM), through making data collection or analysis practices faster, less costly, or more accurate. However, in every socially consequential domain in which AI tools have been applied, these technologies have been demonstrated to have some degree of negative consequences. This paper explores an attempt to convene technical experts in the area of DRM to discuss potential negative impacts, their approaches toward mitigating these impacts as well as identifying some of the overarching challenges. In doing so, we contribute new findings about a domain that has received relatively little attention from critical and ethical AI researchers, and the opportunities and limitations that are presented by working with domain experts to evaluate the social consequences of emerging technologies.",

      "abstract": "Online labour platforms promise efficient, low-friction matching of workers with clients at scale and on-demand. Prior studies on Upwork have shown that the combination of specialized knowledge and expertise, high autonomy and extent of client-worker engagement makes macrotasks a unique category of ‘on-demand’ work. However, there is a need to unpack the nature of macrotask work from the freelancers’ perspective. Based on a qualitative study of 21 freelancers on Upwork, this paper fills this important gap by delineating how freelancers reason about accomplishing macrotasks, their interaction with clients, the key challenges that they face in various stages of the work process, and the strategies they devise to mitigate the costs and overhead. This paper shows that freelancers perceive accomplishing macrotasks as a collaborative achievement with the client. It also demonstrates that the skill-intensive nature of tasks implies that matching freelancer with the task/client is of enormous importance. It describes three programmatic solutions that the platform offers to facilitate the matching process along with their benefits and limitations. It, then, shows how freelancers seek to minimize the costs and work associated with matching and collaboration through repeat hiring along the benefits they result in. Lastly, the paper highlights how the same set of core issues is mirrored for both the freelancer and client sides of the market, which need to be addressed in order to enhance the ease and effectiveness of client-freelancer collaboration.

      "abstract": "In 2020, we have witnessed global experimentation of remote co-working, co-learning, and co-habiting, leading to the re-emergence of a collective search for platforms and paradigms that can optimally coalesce the virtual and physical settings – what has been studied as \"hybrid models\". In this context, we examine the opportunities that the advances in Spatial Audio techniques can create to improve hybrid meetings. Concretely, we present a controlled study in which 84 participants used an online platform to follow six pre-recorded semi-scripted dialogues. The videos were around two minutes long and each of them simulated a piece of conversation in the physical meeting room among three actors who played the role of co-located attendees. The six videos represented six conditions: three auditive formats, (x2) once co-located attendees wore face masks, and once without masks. We compared the experiences of the participants (remote attendees) in these six conditions. Analysing three types of data, namely, comprehension/memory test results, self-reported ratings, and eye-tracking, we have found reinforcing evidence that demonstrates the benefits of binaural audio in hybrid settings.",

      "abstract": "Communities have first-hand knowledge about community issues. The goal of this study is to improve the efficiency of social-technical problem-solving by proposing the concept of ``artificial process intelligence,\" based upon the theories of socio-technical decision-making. The technical challenges addressed were channeling the communication between the internal-facing and external-facing 311 categorizations. Accordingly, deep learning models were trained on data from Kansas City's 311 system: (1) BERT-based classification models that can predict the internal-facing 311 service categories and the city departments that handle the issue; (2) \r\nthe Balanced LDA+BERT clustering (BLBC) model that inductively summarizes residents' complaints and maps the main themes to the internal-facing 311 service categories; (3) a regression time series model that can predict response and completion time. Our case study demonstrated that these models could provide the information needed for reciprocal communication, city service planning, and community envisioning. Future studies should explore interface design like a chatbot and conduct more research on the acceptance and diffusion of AI-assisted 311 systems.",

      "abstract": "Data collection on the population is a key mode of public health management in the Global South where this information is seen as a means to improve health metrics through welfare programs. Anganwadi workers, widely seen as daycare providers and community health workers, are increasingly being asked to exclusively serve as collectors of data on the population. In this study, we examine the changes in the infrastructure of a welfare program in India with the introduction of an ICT-based Real-Time Monitoring System. We ask the question \\textit{`cui bono?'} to this system by drawing attention to the precarious positionality of Anganwadi workers whose care-work is subjected to standardization through this app for `efficient' monitoring by the Indian state but remains contingent on their relationship with the local community and ability to mobilize resources on the ground. Using auto-ethnographic and interview methods, we find that Anganwadi workers are caught between conflicting demands of state bureaucracy that anonymizes caring for its subjects in the form of statistics and the situated nature of care work on the ground producing forms of ambivalent care. An overlaying of a technological reimagination of service delivery on an existing unequal structure of class and labor in India works to the detriment of the anganwadi workers, and in turn, to the very quality of data the projects seek to improve. We conclude that the real-time monitoring apps end up serving the state's need for performing care through the myth of data-driven efficiency at the expense of the professional and personal well-being of the workers, and arguably the communities they serve.

Many technologies support defining and tracking progress toward goals, but these are just some parts of the process of setting and achieving goals. People desire to set goals that are more complex than the ones supported through technology. People use goal-setting technologies longitudinally, yet the understanding of how people’s goals evolve is still limited. We draw understanding from the collaborative practices of mental health therapists and clients in how they set goals longitudinally. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 clients and 7 therapists who practiced goal setting in their therapy sessions. Based on the results, we create the Longitudinal Goal Setting Model in mental health, a three-stage model. The model describes how clients and therapists select among multiple complex problems, simplify complex problems to specific goals, and adjust goals to help people address complex issues. The findings show collaboration between clients and therapists can support transformative reflection practices that are difficult to achieve without the therapist, such as seeing problems through new perspectives, questioning and changing practices, or addressing avoided issues.

      "abstract": "Data is central to the development and evaluation of machine learning (ML) models. However, the use of problematic or inappropriate datasets can result in harms when the resulting models are deployed. To encourage responsible AI practice through more deliberate reflection on datasets and transparency around the processes by which they are created, researchers and practitioners have begun to advocate for increased data documentation and have proposed several data documentation frameworks. However, there is little research on whether these data documentation frameworks meet the needs of ML practitioners, who both create and consume datasets. To address this gap, we set out to understand ML practitioners' data documentation perceptions, needs, challenges, and desiderata, with the ultimate goal of deriving design requirements that can inform future data documentation frameworks. We conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with 14 ML practitioners at a single large, international technology company. We had them answer a list of questions taken from datasheets for datasets. Our findings show that current approaches to data documentation are largely ad hoc and myopic in nature. Participants expressed needs for data documentation frameworks to be adaptable to their contexts, integrated into their existing tools and workflows, and automated wherever possible. Despite the fact that data documentation frameworks are often motivated from the perspective of responsible AI, participants did not make the connection between the questions that they were asked to answer and their responsible AI implications. In addition, participants often had difficulties prioritizing the needs of dataset consumers and providing information that someone unfamiliar with their datasets might need to know. Based on these findings, we derive seven design requirements for future data documentation frameworks such as more actionable guidance on how the characteristics of datasets might result in harms and how these harms might be mitigated, more explicit prompts for reflection, automated adaptation to different contexts, and integration into ML practitioners' existing tools and workflows.",

Our goal is to leverage human intelligence from crowdsourcing systems to guide the discovery of the optimal neural network architecture in the design space to achieve the desirable damage assessment performance. Our work is motivated by the limitation that the deep neural network architectures in current DDA solutions are mainly designed by AI experts, which is known to be both time-consuming and error-prone. Two critical technical challenges exist in solving our problem: i) it is challenging to design a manageable NAS space for crowd-based solutions; ii) it is non-trivial to transfer the imperfect crowd knowledge to effective decisions in identifying the optimal neural network architecture of a DDA application. To address the above challenges, we develop CrowdNAS, a  crowd-guided NAS framework that develops novel techniques inspired by AI, crowdsourcing, and estimation theory to address the NAS problem. The evaluation results from two real-world DDA applications show that CrowdNAS consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art AI-only, crowd-AI, and NAS baselines by achieving the highest classification accuracy in the damage assessment while maintaining a low computational cost under various evaluation scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Online retributive harassment refers to a range of abusive online behaviors targeted at offenders with the intent of sanctioning norm violations. Online retributive harassment is common in online interactions, can be devastating in its effect, and is hard to moderate. We examined the role that negative interface cues (i.e., Dislikes, flags) might have in changing people’s harassment perceptions to mitigate this activity. We conducted a 4 X 2 between-subjects experiment (N = 242) to test the effects of interface cues (control with Likes only vs. Dislikes outnumbering Likes vs. Likes outnumbering Dislikes vs. a flag with Likes) and harassment severity (low vs. high) on how people perceive retributive harassment. We hypothesized that Dislikes and flags, despite the presence of Likes, signal social disapproval and descriptive norms against harassment and thus reduce bystanders’ belief that retributive harassment is appropriate, deserved, or justified. We found that Dislikes can be effective when they outnumber Likes in high-severity harassment but backfire when outnumbered by Likes. A flag, contrary to popular practice, does not have a significant mitigating effect on perceptions of retributive harassment. We demonstrate the potential of negative interface cues to signal anti-harassment norms to bystanders and discuss alternatives to social media platforms’ one-size-fits-all content moderation approach.",

      "abstract": "The software industry lacks gender diversity. Recent research has suggested that a toxic working culture is to blame. Studies have found that communications in software repositories directed towards women are more negative in general. In this study, we use a destructive criticism lens to examine gender differences in software code review feedback. Software code review is a practice where code is peer reviewed and negative feedback is often delivered. We explore differences in perceptions, frequency, and impact of destructive criticism across genders. We surveyed 93 software practitioners eliciting perceived reactions to hypothetical scenarios (or vignettes) where participants are asked to imagine receiving either constructive or destructive criticism. In addition, the survey collected general opinions on feedback obtained during software code review as well as the frequency that participants give and receive destructive criticism.\r\n\r\nWe found that opinions on destructive criticism vary. Women perceive destructive criticism as less appropriate and are less motivated to continue working with the developer after receiving destructive criticism. Destructive criticism is fairly common with more than half of respondents having received nonspecific negative feedback and nearly a quarter having received inconsiderate negative feedback in the past year. Our results suggest that destructive criticism in code review could be a contributing factor to the lack of gender diversity observed in the software industry.",

During identity shifts, impression management and self-presentation, online communities, and social media affordances can allow individuals to better facilitate their experiences. To examine how people perceive their identity to change during major events and how they use social media in the process, we interviewed 28 participants who recently experienced major life events. We found that many people perceived their identity to change through various avenues that they felt were important to their identity: mental processes, identity roles, and identity fulfillment. However, some people perceive their identity to be maintained rather than changed. During identity changes or maintenance, participants utilized impression management and self-presentation to curate their online presence. Participants also used online communities to build relationships with similar others or virtual friends and enable more connections via what we call the domino effect. Social media sites also provided the affordances of editability, visibility control, and spreadability, which can help ease life transition and identity change processes.",

      "abstract": "Thousands of technology professionals attend in-person meetups each month in cities around the world. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic, social distancing requirements have forced meetups in many locations to operate exclusively virtual events for the first time. We surveyed participants (n=251) who attend technology meetup communities in the UK to find out how the pivot from in-person to virtual meetings has affected meetup communities. We gathered data about participants' experiences of virtual meetups and compared with in-person experiences. While in-person meetups are important venues for practitioners to network, learn, socialise, meet people and participate in discussions (enabling transfer of tacit knowledge), participants attend virtual meetings primarily for learning. Virtual meetups offer poor support for socialising, networking, discussion and transfer of tacit knowledge, However, they do offer learning opportunities via structured talks and content, and can rival in-person meetups when it comes to learning new skills like programming, keeping up to date with general technology developments and improving one's general practice. The low barrier to entry for virtual events improves accessibility for both speakers and participants. Our findings suggest that some meetups may benefit from considering how to incorporate virtual meeting formats into their schedules for the long-term.",

      "abstract": "Platform labor and gig work have become key sites for understanding a nascent “future of work” hallmarked by informalization and digitization. A growing body of research emphasizes how experiences of platform work are mediated not only by algorithms and user interfaces, but also by gender, race, local cultures as well as labor hierarchies. Drawing from ongoing ethnographic research on the digital transformation of healthcare, we show how therapists' experiences of platform labor are centrally shaped by the historical and ongoing feminization of mental health work. Platforms reinscribe feminized labor conditions that are pervasive in the healthcare industry, and yet platform labor appears as 'useful' to some therapists as they navigate a set of precarious career choices fundamentally structured by feminization.  We use the analytic of the stopgap to describe platforms' two-fold reproduction of the status quo: first by offering an approximation of freedom to individual workers, helping to forestall a crisis of unsustainable work conditions; and second by reinscribing the same logics of exploitation in order to make labor scalable.  This stopgap analytic reorients the focus away from the impact of the platforms technologies as such, towards the conditions that make stopgap solutions necessary for survival. It also points towards the importance of intervening in the conditions of exclusion and exploitation that help to create a market for platform stopgaps.",

      "abstract": "Human data labeling with multiple labelers and the resulting conflict resolution remains the norm for many enterprise machine learning pipelines. Conflict resolution can be a time-intensive and costly process. Our goal was to study how human-AI collaboration can improve conflict resolution, by enabling users to automate groups of conflict resolution tasks. However, little is known about whether and how people will rely on automation during conflict resolution. Currently, automation commonly uses labelers' majority vote labels for conflict resolution, as the top chosen label by most labelers is often correct. We envisioned a system where an AI would assist in finding cases where the labeler majority vote was wrong and where automation is supported for batches or groups of conflicts. In order to understand whether humans could use labeler and AI information effectively, we investigated how and when users rely on labeler and AI information and on automated group conflict resolution. We ran a study with 144 Mechanical Turk workers. We found that automation increased users' accuracy/time, use of automated conflict resolution was relatively similar regardless of whether the automation was based on labeler or AI selected labels, and providing labeler and AI selected labels may reduce inappropriate reliance on automation.

      "abstract": "Hybrid Collaboration, where remote and co-located team members work together using different devices and tools, has already been trending in recent years (e.g., through globalization and international cooperation) but experienced a further boost since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reason behind this surge in hybrid practices is probably that the crisis revealed aspects of remote collaboration which proved functional and which many decision makers (in industry as well as academia) plan to retain for the future. Thus, hybrid collaboration is an extremely timely topic which should be further studied in the context of CSCW. \r\nOne major CSCW-anchored concept that has most intensively been researched in co-located collaboration settings where it is usually inherently related to spatial aspects and proximity, is territoriality. Already work on territoriality in fully distributed, remote settings has shown that there are significant differences due to the characteristics of the scenario.\r\nIn this paper, we focus on territoriality in hybrid settings where we identified a significant research gap, and present the results of a user study with 22 teams consisting of four people each (distributed across two locations at two different universities), collaborating on a problem-solving task. \r\nOur findings reveal that more dimensions and communication channels, in addition to space, might strongly impact territoriality and territorial behavior in hybrid collaboration. Besides classical spatial territories also auditory territories frequently emerged. In addition, visibility of and accessibility to certain territories need to be rethought. We discuss these novel findings also regarding their interplay with earlier ones and derive design implications for CSCW systems supporting hybrid collaboration.",

This paper explores the role of social support across behavioral change journeys among young adults, a group at high risk for mental health challenges, but with the lowest rates of mental health treatment utilization. Given that digital mental health tools are effective for treating mental health conditions, they hold particular promise for bridging the treatment gap among young adults, many of whom, are not interested in – or cannot access – traditional mental healthcare. We recruited a sample of young adults with depression who were seeking information about their symptoms online to participate in an Asynchronous Remote Community (ARC) elicitation workshop. Participants detailed the changing nature of social interactions across their behavior change journeys. They noted that both directed and undirected support are necessary early in behavioral change and certain needs such as informational support are particularly pronounced, while healthy coping partnerships and accountability are more important later in the change process. We discuss the conceptual and design implications of our findings for the next generation of digital mental health tools.",

      "abstract": "In developing countries suffering from a severe shortage of physicians, the follow-up clinical consultation of long-term chronic care becomes a high-speed collaborative work, which has to be conducted in a few minutes. Although much existing work studies how time factors affect physicians’ workflows and requirements for information systems, high-speed chronic care is yet to be well investigated. This work bridges the gap by presenting a case of a pediatric hospital in China. We focus on the processes of follow-up consultations, the factors enabling physicians to complete consultation in several minutes, as well as the challenges faced by physicians and patients. Through observations and interviews, we find that physicians conduct multiple tasks (information acquisition, patient-provider communication, and medical data documentation) simultaneously to reduce the consultation duration. Adopting an information summary alternative is the key to fast information acquisition. Templates and references in EMR contribute to rapid documentation and prescription. However,multitasking brings physicians a heavy cognitive load. It also severely compresses the duration of patient-provider communication. As a result, some of the patients’ needs, especially emotional ones, are neglected.Based on these findings, we discuss the characteristics and requirements of high-speed chronic care and accordingly propose design suggestions.",

      "abstract": "Social media has become an important source where people gather and communicate news. Prior studies in conventional mass media suggest that gatekeepers play an important role in the production of news messages. Despite the initial claim of social media being a place of democratized participation, we now know, social media is not free of gatekeepers either. However, it is unclear who social media gatekeepers are, how to identify them, and most importantly how do they impact news content production and dissemination. Due to fundamental differences between the structure and workings of social media vs. traditional media, what we know from mass media cannot directly apply in the context of social media. To answer these questions, we propose an actionable definition of social media gatekeepers backed by literature on news reporting in social media and traditional mass media. We then present a case study of identifying gatekeepers on Twitter at scale, using a set of 70k Twitter users interested in the news topic of ``immigration''. The results of our mixed research approach highlight that, unlike the general Twitter users, the Twitter gatekeepers are often self-determining citizen journalists who manage their media presentation strategically. Moreover, Twitter gatekeepers tend to exhibit behavior mostly in accordance with the journalism norms and they contribute to and guard the truthfulness and neutrality of content. ",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the role of live streaming in distributed collaborative software development using indie game development, an end-user driven creative community, as an example. We conducted 27 in-depth interviews with indie game developers from various cultures and countries, who had engaged in live streaming for collaborative software development either as a streamer or a viewer. Our findings show how live streaming can be used by indie game developers to support their endeavors to innovate the traditional game development model, which goes beyond just learning and teaching technical skills. We also highlight the potential challenges indie developers face in this process. We thus make unique contributions to CSCW by bridging the previously often disconnected research agendas on collaborative software development and live streaming. We also provide potential directions for designing future live streaming platforms to better support distributed collaboration in emerging end-user driven creative activities.",

      "abstract": "Persuading people to change their opinions is a common practice in online discussion forums on topics ranging from political campaigns to relationship consultation. Enhancing people's ability to write persuasive arguments could not only practice their critical thinking and reasoning but also contribute to the effectiveness and civility in online communication. It is, however, not an easy task in online discussion settings where written words are the primary communication channel. In this paper, we derived four design goals for a tool that helps users improve the persuasiveness of arguments in online discussions through a survey with 123 online forum users and interviews with five debating experts. To satisfy these design goals, we analyzed and built a labeled dataset of fine-grained persuasive strategies (i.e., logos, pathos, ethos, and evidence) in 164 arguments with high ratings on persuasiveness from ChangeMyView, a popular online discussion forum. We then designed an interactive visual system, Persua, which provides example-based guidance on persuasive strategies to enhance the persuasiveness of arguments. In particular, the system constructs portfolios of arguments based on different persuasive strategies applied to a given discussion topic. It then presents concrete examples based on the difference between the portfolios of user input and high-quality arguments in the dataset. A between-subjects study shows suggestive evidence that Persua encourages users to submit more times for feedback and helps users improve more on the persuasiveness of their arguments than a baseline system. Finally, a set of design considerations was summarized to guide future intelligent systems that improve the persuasiveness in text.",

However, research on therapists’ usage of interactive software has been primarily based in training and mock-clinical settings. In this paper, we present a qualitative study of clinicians’ experience using CORE-MI, a collaborative recording and annotation software, in a real-world university counseling center. We describe how and why therapists, both trainees and licensed staff, used CORE-MI to support their practice and improve their skills. We also consider how usage varied with therapists’ developmental level and how the software impacted relationships between supervisors and supervisees. Finally, we offer recommendations for future research and design of interactive systems in mental health settings.",

      "abstract": "Human-centric fauxtography is a category of multi-modal posts that spread misleading information on online information distribution and sharing platforms such as online social media. The reason of a human-centric post being fauxtography is closely related to its multi-modal content that consists of diversified human and non-human subjects with complex and implicit relationships. In this paper, we focus on an explainable fauxtography detection problem where the goal is to accurately identify and explain why a human-centric social media post is fauxtography (or not). Our problem is motivated by the limitations of current fauxtography detection solutions that focus primarily on the detection task but ignore the important aspect of explaining their results (e.g., why a certain component of the post delivers the misinformation). Two important challenges exist in solving our problem: 1) it is difficult to capture the implicit relations and attributions of different subjects in a fauxtography post given the fact that many of such knowledge is shared between different crowd workers; 2) it is not a trivial task to create a multi-modal knowledge graph from crowd workers to identify and explain human-centric fauxtography posts with multi-modal contents. To address the above challenges, we develop CrowdGraph, a crowdsourcing based multi-modal knowledge graph approach to address the explainable fauxtography detection problem. We evaluate the performance of CrowdGraph by creating a real-world dataset that consists of human-centric fauxtography posts from Twitter and Reddit. The results show that CrowdGraph not only detects the fauxtography posts more accurately than the state-of-the-arts but also provides well-justified explanations to the detection results with convincing evidence.",

      "abstract": "When people have the freedom to create and post content on the internet, particularly anonymously, they do not always respect the rules and regulations of the websites on which they post, leaving other unsuspecting users vulnerable to sexism, racism, threats, and other unacceptable content in their daily cyberspace diet. However, content moderators witness the worst of humanity on a daily basis in place of the average netizen. This takes its toll on moderators, causing stress, fatigue, and emotional distress akin to the symptomology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The goal of the present study was to explore whether adding positive stimuli to breaktimes–-images of baby animals or beautiful, aweinspiring landscapes–-could help reduce the negative side-effects of being a content moderator. To test this, we had over 300 experienced content moderators read and decide whether 200 fake text-based social media posts were acceptable or not for public consumption. Although we set out to test positive emotional stimulation, however, we actually found that it is the cumulative nature of the negative emotions that likely negates most of the effects of the intervention: the longer the person had practiced content moderation, the stronger their negative experience. Connections to compassion fatigue and how best to spend work breaks as a content moderator are discussed.",

      "abstract": "A sense of community is important in encouraging people to contribute to a variety of causes and the communities that support them. Researchers have identified website design features that can engender a sense of community on sites to promote contributions. However, most findings about the design features are based on observational empirical research testing single features at a time or on standard practice and rarely use integrated theories to provide rationale for their design suggestions. This work investigates ways to re-design an entire website---with a simulated medical crowdfunding interface entitled Community Journey---informed by Sense of Community Theory to increase site visitors' sense of community and contributions. A between-subjects experiment revealed that the Community Journey interface increased potential supporters' sense of community and their overall willingness to contribute via monetary donations, campaign shares, message writings, and offline support. Think-aloud interviews identified the interface features responsible for the overall increase in willingness to contribute. Finally, we suggest theory driven design implications for creating websites to build a strong support community and to encourage various contributions.",

This form of cyberbullying is an unpleasant and sometimes dangerous phenomenon for online social networks. Although prior work exists on automated identification of other types of cyberbullying, a need exists for methods capable of detecting doxing on Twitter specifically. We propose and evaluate a set of approaches for automatically detecting second- and third-party disclosures on Twitter of sensitive private information, a subset of which constitutes doxing. We summarize our findings of common intentions behind doxing episodes and compare nine different approaches for automated detection based on string-matching and one-hot encoded heuristics, as well as word and contextualized string embedding representations of tweets. We identify an approach providing 96.86% accuracy and 97.37% recall using contextualized string embeddings and conclude by discussing the practicality of our proposed methods.",

      "abstract": "COVID-19 has been a sustained and global crisis with a strong continual impact on daily life. Staying accurately informed about COVID-19 has been key to personal and communal safety, especially for essential workers---individuals whose jobs have required them to go into work throughout the pandemic---as their employment has exposed them to higher risks of contracting the virus. Through 14 semi-structured interviews, we explore how essential workers across industries navigated the COVID-19 information landscape to get up-to-date information in the early months of the pandemic.  We find that essential workers living through a sustained crisis have a broad set of information needs. We summarize these needs in a framework that centers 1) fulfilling job requirements, 2) assessing personal risk, and 3) keeping up with crisis news coverage. Our findings also show that the sustained nature of COVID-19 crisis coverage led essential workers to experience breaking points and develop coping strategies. Additionally, we show how workplace communications may act as a mediating force in this process: lack of adequate information in the workplace caused workers to struggle with navigating a contested information landscape, while consistent updates and information exchanges at work could ease the stress of information overload. Our findings extend the crisis informatics field by providing contextual knowledge about the information needs of essential workers during a sustained crisis. Our framework acts as a resource for future scholars and practitioners examining workplace communications in a sustained crisis.",

Yet users often desire functionality that goes beyond what designers, and the organisations they work in, are willing to supply. Analysing online forums, complemented with interviews, we document how users, hackers and software developers worked together to discover and apply system exploits in hardware and software. We cover four cases: users of CPAP breathing assistance machines getting access to their own sleep data, ‘hacking’ the Nintendo switch game console to run non-authorised software, end-users building their own insulin supply system, and farmers repairing their own agriculture equipment against suppliers terms and conditions. We propose the concept of the ‘gulf of interests’ to understand how differing interests can create conflicts between end-users, designers, and the organisations they work in. This points us in the direction of researching further the political and economic situations of technology development and use.\r\n",

      "abstract": "With the growing adoption of digital technology in healthcare organizations, it is important to understand nursing professionals’ behavior and challenges, and the corresponding privacy implications around digital technology use. To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 participants (16 nursing professionals, and five nursing faculties) in the USA. In our study with nursing professionals, we explored how they used digital technology and protected sensitive health data at their workplace. We investigated their understanding of privacy breaches and possible consequences, the challenges they encountered to maintaining privacy, and their workarounds to deal with such issues. We looked into the support that professional nurses receive in the form of organizational training, and how they collaborate with the IT department at their institution to address technical issues. In addition, we shed light on the gap between their academic preparation and professional needs in the context of digital technology use and privacy protection, where we also interviewed five nursing faculties to get more in-depth understanding of this issue from the point of view of academia. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights for the CSCW community to better understand the challenges and privacy risks in digital technology use by nursing professionals, and lead to our recommendations to address these issues.",

      "abstract": "Online mental health communities (OMHCs) have emerged in recent years as an effective and accessible way to obtain peer support, filling crucial gaps of traditional mental health resources. However, the mechanisms for users to find relationships that fulfill their needs and capabilities in these communities are highly underdeveloped. Using a mixed-methods approach of user interviews and behavioral log analysis on 7Cups.com, we explore central challenges in finding adequate peer relationships in online support platforms and how algorithmic matching can alleviate many of these issues. We measure the impact of using qualities like gender and age in purposeful matching to improve member experiences, with especially salient results for users belonging to vulnerable populations. Lastly, we note key considerations for designing matching systems in the online mental health context, such as the necessity for better moderation to avoid potential harassment behaviors exacerbated by algorithmic matching. Our findings yield key insights into current user experiences in OMHCs as well as design implications for building matching systems in the future for OMHCs.",

      "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) supports many of our everyday activities and decisions. However, personalized algorithmic recommendations often produce adverse experiences due to a lack of awareness, control, or transparency. While research has directed solutions on graphical user interfaces (GUIs), there are no explorations of Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) to improve the experience with such systems, despite the valid existing academic arguments in favor of this exploration. Therefore, centering on transparency and control, we analyzed how 18 users of movie recommender systems perceived four different TUIs using individual co-design sessions and post-interview questionnaires. Through thematic analysis, we identified seven design considerations while designing TUIs to interact with algorithmic movie recommender systems: (1) Distinctions between TUIs and GUIs; (2) TUIs replacing predominant interfaces; (3) Preference for single-device TUIs; (4) The relevance of granular control for TUIs; (5) Apparent transparency limitations of TUIs; (6) TUIs and algorithmic social computing; and (7) Overview of specific design choices, including advantages and disadvantages of soft, hard, rounded, cubic, and humanoid interfaces. These findings inspired Recffy: the first functional TUI designed to enhance awareness and control in personalized movie recommendations. Based on this study, we propose the concept of Tangible Algorithms: TUIs dedicated to enhancing the interaction of algorithmic systems and their profiling processes or decisions in a specific context. Furthermore, we describe the relevance of tangible algorithms and design guidelines to promote them in diverse AI contexts. Finally, we invite the HCI and CSCW community to continue exploring tangible algorithms to address the interaction with algorithmic systems, including the collaborative and social computing dynamics they can promote in diverse AI contexts.",

Reporting on results of interviews with 19 civic workers who perform data work as their main task, we identify an atypical relationship between subject-domain experts (such as our interviewees) and full members of the data work community. Our interviewees may have less computational skill in data work, but they have extensive and varied practices to engage in data contextualization that data scientists and other full community members could learn from. In identifying the attributes of data workers on the periphery, we also hope to call attention to the challenges they face in performing data work in low resources institutions (e.g., governmental, non-profit). Our findings contribute to the larger conversations in human-centered data science about who performs data work and how they go about it, in order to addresses questions of power, fairness, and bias in data-intensive systems.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic that forced the closure of campuses in the spring of 2020 accelerated the diffusion of distance education in Universities worldwide.  The need to shift to distance education without time to prepare or train teachers or students led to what has been called a crisis learning situation in what was far from a seamless transition. This article surveyed 200 students at a large university in the United States at the end of the spring semester in 2020 about their online learner readiness including access to technological infrastructure (computers and highspeed Internet access), computer self-efficacy, computer anxiety, and how that influenced positive and negative learning experiences and feelings about distance education and learning. A four-stage Structural Equation Model shows a detailed picture of the distance education process and suggests intervention points to improve its outcomes. Results suggest that access to technological infrastructure are necessary but not sufficient for successful distance education experiences and point to the critical importance of computer self-efficacy and anxiety in predicting positive (or negative) learning experiences, which lead to increased feelings of learning and the likelihood that students will choose distance education in the future.",

      "abstract": "Building a successful community means governing active populations and limited resources. This challenge often requires communities to design formal governance systems from scratch. But the characteristics of successful institutional designs are unclear. Communities that are more mature and established may have more elaborate formal policy systems (as cause or effect of their success). Alternatively, they may require less formalization precisely because of their maturity: because they have more latitude and capacity to select and acculturate new members, or because their reputations encourage greater self-selection. Indeed, scholars often downplay the role that formal rules relative to unwritten rules, norms, and values. But in a community with formal rules, decisions are more consistent, transparent, and legitimate. To understand the relationship of formal institutions to community maturity and governance style, we conduct a large-scale quantitative analysis applying institutional analysis frameworks of self-governance scholar Elinor Ostrom to 80,000 communities across 3 platforms: the sandbox game Minecraft, the MMO game World of Warcraft, and Reddit. We classify communities' written rules according to several institutional taxonomies in order to test predictors of institutional formalization. From this analysis we extract two major findings. First, institutional formalization, the size and complexity of an online community’s governance system, is generally positively associated with maturity, as measured by age, population size, or degree of user engagement. Second, we find that online communities employ similar governance styles across platforms, strongly favoring “weak” norms to “strong” requirements. These findings suggest that designers and founders of online communities converge, to some extent independently, on styles of governance practice that are correlated with successful self-governance. With deeper insights into the patterns of successful self-governance, we can help more communities overcome the challenges of self-governance and create for their members powerful experiences of shared meaning and collective empowerment.",

      "abstract": "Public school districts across the United States have implemented school choice systems that have the potential to improve underserved students' access to educational opportunities. However, research has shown that learning about and applying for schools can be extremely time-consuming and expensive, making it difficult for these systems to create more equitable access to resources in practice. A common factor surfaced in prior work is unequal access to information about the schools and enrollment process. In response, governments and non-profits have invested in providing more information about schools to parents, for instance, through detailed online dashboards. However, we know little about what information is actually useful for historically marginalized and underserved families. We conducted interviews with 10 low-income families and families of color to learn about the challenges they faced navigating an online school choice and enrollment system. We complement this data with four interviews with people who have supported families through the enrollment process in a wide range of roles, from school principal to non-profit staff (``parent advocates''). Our findings highlight the value of personalized support and trusting relationships to delivering relevant and helpful information. We contrast this against online information resources and dashboards, which tend to be impersonal, target a broad audience, and make strong assumptions about what parents should look for in a school without sensitivity to families' varying circumstances. We advocate for an assets-based design approach to information support in public school enrollment, which would ask how we can support the local, one-on-one support that community members already provide.",

      "abstract": "Background: The Pull-Request (PR) model is a widespread approach adopted by open source software (OSS) projects to support collaborative software development. However, it is often challenging to continuously evaluate and revise PRs in several iterations of code reviews involving technical and social aspects. Aim: Our objective is twofold: identifying best practices for effective collaboration in continuous PR improvement and uncovering problems that deserve special attention to improve collaboration efficiency and productivity. Method: We conducted a mixed-methods empirical study of repeatedly revised PRs (i.e., those that have undergone a high number of revisions). Historical trace data of five long-lived popular GitHub projects were used for manual investigation of practices for requesting changes to PRs and reasons for nonacceptance of repeatedly revised PRs. Surveys of OSS practitioners were conducted to evaluate the results of manual analysis and to provide additional insights into developers’ willingness regarding PR revisions and factors causing avoidable revisions in practice. Results: The main results of our research were as follows: (1) We identified 15 code review practices for requesting changes to PRs, among which practices with respect to explaining the reasoning behind requested changes and tracking the progress of PR review and revision were undervalued by reviewers; (2) While submitters can in general undergo 1-5 rounds of revisions, they are willing to offer more revisions when they are in a friendly community and receive helpful feedback; (3) We revealed 11 factors causing avoidable revisions regarding to reviewers’ feedback, code review policy, pre-submission issues, and implementation of new revisions; and (4) Nonacceptance of repeatedly revised PRs was due mainly to inactivity of submitters or reviewers and being superseded for better maintenance. Finally, based on these findings, we proposed recommendations and implications for OSS practitioners and tool designers to facilitate efficient collaboration in PR revisions.",

This is the scenario we have found ourselves in as we conduct values-inclusive participatory design to develop and deploy critical digital literacy education in a rural Appalachian community. We present provocations which outline the ethical concerns we have grappled with in pursuit of conducting fair and responsible research for our participants, indirect stakeholders, and ourselves. Through consideration of these provocations, we have developed a preliminary approach for managing a research relationship with those with whom we disagree which we call Designing for Shared Values. This approach is a conflict-avoidant method for negotiating values in values-inclusive design. It centers around reflexivity as a mechanism to account for one's own values and potential impacts of design research outcomes on indirect stakeholders, while maintaining responsibility to prioritize beneficial outcomes to research participants.",

While there is a large body of research focused on understanding privacy concerns and threat models of SHD users, there is limited research so far aimed at informing the development of privacy controls in SHDs. This paper presents the results of 25 interviews focused on characterizing the users' needs for privacy controls. Through qualitative analysis of interview data, we present 7 design factors and 32 sub-factors for the design of privacy controls in SHDs. The interview findings informed the design of a survey that was deployed to 440 adult SHD users to gain quantitative insights on privacy control requirements and to complement the interview findings. Based on the findings, we discuss a privacy control framework that guides designers towards user-centric privacy controls. ",

Hobbyists have been well-studied in HCI and may similarly benefit from remote skill-sharing. However, little is known about how XR technologies might support expert-novice collaboration for skilled hobby activities. This paper examines the potential and limitations of XR to connect experts and novices for one such activity: gardening. Through two studies involving 27 expert and novice gardeners, we designed prototypes to understand 1) practitioner perceptions of XR and remote skill-sharing in the garden and 2) what kinds of interactions can be supported in XR for expert-novice groups. We discuss design opportunities and challenges for XR systems in supporting informal connecting interactions and meaningful sensory interactions with a remote environment during skill-sharing.",

      "abstract": "Culturally responsive STEM and computing initiatives aim to engage and embolden a diverse range of learners, center their identity and experiences in curriculum, and connect learners to each other and their communities. With an abrupt pivot to online learning at the beginning of 2020, more educational experiences have taken place virtually. We ran a virtual synchronous culturally responsive computing camp and saw that establishing the right environment online to support a good sense of connectedness was challenging. To investigate this further, we interviewed eight K-12 instructors of culturally responsive STEM and computing programs. Three themes emerged on defining and cultivating connectedness in learning experiences, the role of equity in supporting community online, and affordances of being online specific to culturally responsive perspectives. We support our thematic findings with vignettes from the camp data. In this study, we address K-12 culturally responsive STEM and computing instructors’ beliefs, experiences, and approaches regarding cultivating connectedness online. This work fills a gap in understanding instructor perspectives on building in-program and broader community connections online from a culturally responsive STEM and computing lens.",

Prior work has shown, in experimental settings, that social media are effective platforms for encouraging security-enhancing behavior and sharing security experiences. To understand how effective security and privacy discussions on social networks may be in practice, we study, via historical social media logs of 38 participants containing almost 200,000 social media posts, how and how much participants talked about security and privacy on social media platforms, specifically Facebook and Twitter. We found that interactions with security and privacy posts made up less than 0.09% of all interactions we observed. A thematic analysis of the security- and privacy-related posts that participants interacted with revealed that very rarely were posts constructively talking about security and privacy, instead often joking about security practices or encouraging undesirable behavior. Our findings, though based on a fraction of the population of social media users, suggest that while social networks may be effective in influencing security behavior, there may not be enough substantial or useful discussions of security and privacy to encourage better security behaviors in practice and on a larger scale. Our findings highlight the importance of increasing the prevalence of constructive security and privacy advice on online social media in order to encourage widespread adoption of best security practices.",

      "abstract": "When pieces from an individual’s personal information available online are connected over time and across multiple platforms, this more complete digital trace can give unintended insights into their life and opinions. In a data narrative interview study with 26 currently employed participants, we examined risks and harms to individuals and employers when others joined the dots between their online information. We discuss the themes of visibility and self-disclosure, unintentional information leakage and digital privacy literacies constructed from our analysis. We contribute insights not only into people's difficulties in recalling and conceptualising their digital traces but of subsequently envisioning how their online information may be combined, or (re)identified across their traces and address a current gap in research by showing that awareness is lacking around the potential for personal information to be correlated by and made coherent to/by others, posing risks to individuals, employers, and even the state. We touch on inequalities of privacy, freedom and legitimacy that exist for different groups with regard to what they make (or feel compelled to make) available online and we contribute to current methodological work on the use of sketching to support visual sense making in data narrative interviews. We conclude by discussing the need for interventions that support personal reflection on the potential visibility of combined digital traces to spotlight hidden vulnerabilities, and promote more proactive action about what is shared and not shared online.

While most of this research area is catered towards the interest of requesters, we view this workflow as a teacher-learner interaction scenario where one or more human-teachers solve Human Intelligence Tasks to train machine learners. In this work, we explore how teachable machine learners can impact their human-teachers, and whether they form a trustable relation that can be relied upon for task delegation in the context of crowdsourcing. Specifically, we focus our work on teachable agents that learn to classify news articles while also guiding the teaching process through conversational interventions. In a two-part study, where several crowd workers individually teach the agent, we investigate whether this learning by teaching approach benefits human-machine collaboration, and whether it leads to trustworthy AI agents that crowd workers would delegate tasks to. Results demonstrate the benefits of the learning by teaching approach, in terms of perceived usefulness for crowdworkers, and the dynamics of trust built through the teacher-learner interaction.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce an innovative design concept for the curation of data, which we call ‘Data Story’. We view this as an additional resource for data curation, aimed specifically at supporting the sharing of qualitative and ethnographic data. The Data Story concept is motivated by three elements: 1. the increased attention of funding agencies and academic institutions on Research Data Management and Open Science; 2. our own work with colleagues applying ethnographic research methods; and 3. existing literature that has identified specific challenges in this context. Ongoing issues entailed in dealing with certain contextual factors that are inherent to qualitative research reveal the extent to which we still lack technical design solutions that can support meaningful curation and sharing. Data Story provides a singular way of addressing these issues by integrating traditional data curation approaches, where research data are treated as ‘objects’ to be curated and preserved according to specific standards, with a more contextual, culturally-nuanced and collaborative organizing layer that can be thought of as a “Story”. The concept draws on existing literature on data curation, digital storytelling and Critical Data Studies (CDS). As a possible design solution for Research Data Management and data curation, Data Story offers: 1) a collaborative workflow for data curation; 2) a story-like format that can serve as an organizing principle; 3) a means of enhancing and naturalizing curation practices through storytelling. Data Story is currently being developed for deployment and evaluation.",

      "abstract": "The study of work practices across two or more collaborative platforms is relatively rare. Participants and researchers have to be competent, or even experts, in both just to begin to make sense of what is happening. With the growing popularity of peer-production systems, the integration of resources across various platforms is more and more common. The framework of stitching is one analytical stance that has been used to describe the cross-platform work to build and highlight informational and social networks. Through a qualitative study with 32 participants who have different foci on Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, we reveal their practices in three essential stitching processes, production, curation, and dynamic integration. We highlight how their practices enact stitching and extend the conceptual framework to explain barriers that inhibit effective stitching across platforms. We further discuss implications for research in cross-platform work and design to facilitate Wikipedia-Commons collaboration.",

However, the speech-based experience gets disrupted when users must go back to a screen and keyboard to review and edit the text. While existing dictation systems focus on improving transcription and error correction, little is known about how to support speech input for the entire text creation process, including composition, reviewing and editing. We conducted an experiment in which ten pairs of participants took on the roles of authors and typists to work on a text authoring task. By analysing the natural language patterns of both authors and typists, we identified new challenges and opportunities for the design of future dictation interfaces, including the ambiguity of human dictation, the differences between audio-only and with screen, and various passive and active assistance that can potentially be provided by future systems.

We interview eleven founders and moderators of six distinct, closed, women-only Facebook groups that predominantly cater to women in and from the Global South. The study provides insights into the motivations and mechanisms for creating and moderating these safe spaces, the affordances of social networking sites that enable or hinder the creation and moderation of such spaces and finally, and the deep impact moderating such spaces has on the women who manage them. Based on these findings we discuss suggestions for specific technological affordances to enable and support digital safe spaces for marginalized and vulnerable communities.",

      "abstract": "  YouTube has long been a top-choice destination for independent video content\r\n  creators to share their work. A large part of YouTube's appeal is owed to its\r\n  practice of sharing advertising revenue with qualifying content creators\r\n  through the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). In recent years, changes to the\r\n  monetization policies and the introduction of algorithmic systems for making\r\n  monetization decisions have been a source of controversy and tension between\r\n  content creators and the platform. \r\n  There have been numerous accusations suggesting that the underlying\r\n  monetization algorithms engage in preferential treatment of larger channels\r\n  and effectively censor minority voices by demonetizing their content. \r\n\r\n  In this paper, we conduct a measurement of the YouTube monetization\r\n  algorithms. We begin by measuring the incidence rates of different\r\n  monetization decisions and the time taken to reach them. Next, we\r\n  analyze the relationships between video content, channel popularity and these\r\n  decisions. Finally, we explore the relationship between demonetization and a channel's\r\n  view growth rate. Taken all together, our work suggests that demonetization after\r\n  a video is publicly listed is not a common occurrence, the characteristics of\r\n  the process are associated with channel size and (in unexplainable ways) video\r\n  topic, and demonetization appears to have a harsh influence on the growth\r\n  rate of smaller\r\n  channels. We also highlight the challenges associated with conducting\r\n  large-scale algorithm audits such as ours and make an argument for more\r\n  transparency in algorithmic decision-making.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Work and learning communities have become increasingly networked to support their members in developing the skills to solve complex, real-world problems. Though disciplinary knowledge remains important to tackle these problems, working effectively in these modern-day communities of practice demands the ability for one to learn how to access networked support (e.g., venues, tools, resource guides, or peers) throughout the community for one’s needs. Against this backdrop, we study networked orchestration--how community members access and learn to access networked supports--in a community of practice for undergraduate research training. Through field observations and in-depth interviews, we find that students in the networked research community dynamically engage with their mentors and peers across multiple venues throughout the week in order to identify, clarify, and resolve their needs. Mentors in the community monitor how students are engaging with the supports available in the network, and provide coaching on effective strategies when students are ineffective on their own. Finally, we surface the challenges involved in each of these processes and offer practical insights for future ecosystem-level networked orchestration technologies that have an understanding of the interactions occurring across the venues and tools in a community, and can support the learning and practice of effective access strategies. Our paper presents important insights for supporting people’s work and learning needs in networked future workplaces and learning communities, and provides guidance on designing new technologies for supporting networked ways of working and learning.",

      "abstract": "Change is an inevitable part of a parent's role, whether due to their child's development, family life, or external events. To understand the information needs of parents navigating change, we studied the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as a widely experienced disruption in the lives of parents and children. We interviewed 16 parents about their caregiving experience as the COVID-19 pandemic collapsed boundaries between home, school, and work. In particular, we asked about adjustments to behavioral care, or the social learning, supports, and interventions through which children develop social and emotional skills. We focused on parents of children already receiving accommodations and behavioral support from their school, to understand how disruptions in these services affected the role of the parent in meeting their child's individual needs. Applying role theory and the Kübler-Ross change curve, we describe the coping mechanisms that parents used to navigate the stages of change, as well as the information needs that remained unmet, despite their efforts. We discuss how practitioner-initiated and parent-centered supports can be designed around the lived experience of change, by accommodating a parent's capacity to accept and use help at different stages.",

      "abstract": "Differential privacy is one of the most popular technologies in the growing area of privacy-conscious data analytics. But differential privacy, along with other privacy-enhancing technologies, may enable privacy theater. In implementations of differential privacy, certain algorithm parameters control the tradeoff between privacy protection for individuals and utility for the data collector; thus, data collectors who do not provide transparency into these parameters may obscure the limited protection offered by their implementation of differential privacy. Through large-scale online surveys, we investigate whether explanations of differential privacy that hide important information about algorithm parameters persuade users to share more browser history data. Surprisingly, we find that the explanations have little effect on individuals' willingness to share data; in fact, most people make up their minds about whether or not to share before they even learn about the privacy protection.",

      "abstract": "Conversational interfaces require two types of curation: \\textit{data curation} by data science workers and \\textit{content curation} by domain experts.\r\n  Recent years have seen the possibilities for content curators to instruct conversational machines in the customer service domain (i.e., Machine Teaching). The activities of curating specialized data are time-consuming. These activities have a learning curve for the domain expert, and they rely on collaborators beyond the domain experts, including product owners, technology expert curators, management, marketing, and communication employees. However, recent research has looked at making this task easier for domain experts with a lack of knowledge in the Machine Learning system, and few papers have investigated the work practices and collaborations involved in this role. This paper aims to fill this gap, presenting and unveiling practices extracted from eleven semi-structured interviews and four design workshops with experts in Banking, Technical support, Humans Resources, Telecommunications, and Automotive sectors. First, we investigate the articulation work of the  content curators and tech curators in training conversational machines. Second, we inspect the curatorial and collaboration strategies they use, which are not afforded by current conversational platforms. Third, we draw the design implications and possibilities to support individual and collaboration curating practices. We reflect on how those practices rely on self and collaboration with others for curation, trust, and data tracking and ownership.",

      "abstract": "Wikipedia---like most peer production communities---suffers from a basic problem: the amount of work that needs to be done (articles to be created and improved) exceeds the available resources (editor effort). Recommender systems have been deployed to address this problem, but they have tended to recommend work tasks that match individuals’ personal interests, ignoring more global community values. In English Wikipedia, discussion about Vital articles constitutes a proxy for community values about the types of articles that are most important, and should therefore be prioritized for improvement. We first analyzed these discussions, finding that an article’s priority is considered a function of 1) its inherent importance and 2) its effects on Wikipedia’s global composition. One important example of the second consideration is balance, including along the dimensions of gender and geography. We then conducted a quantitative analysis evaluating how four different article prioritization methods---two from prior research---would affect Wikipedia’s overall balance on these two dimensions; we found significant differences among the methods. We discuss the implications of our results, including particularly how they can guide the design of recommender systems that take into account community values, not just individuals' interests.",

      "abstract": "Many social media feeds are incorporated with “Suggested Posts,” an AI-infused feature that recommends algorithmically selected posts from accounts that a user does not follow. While such recommendations might increase user engagement with the platforms, there lacks understanding on how such system-driven recommendations influence the primary purpose of social media use: social interactions. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 Instagram users to investigate how they perceive the “Suggested Posts” feature in relation to their in-app social interaction practices. Our findings reveal that suggested posts acted as a double-edged sword for communication with their actual friends, acted as an obstacle for digital self-presentation, and acted as an unwanted force that compel users to increase social groups. Based on the findings, we discuss the importance of considering user agency over social interactions in designing user experiences of recommendations provided in social media.",

However, the study also highlighted the challenge of dealing with users’ mutually redundant reports. Nevertheless, CAMPUS exhibits strong potential for enabling individuals on a campus to collaboratively inform each other about campus-related information; and our future work will show how individuals on campus leverage this system on a daily basis.

Technologies can be used to ease the challenges teachers face with implementing CRT-related practices including inadequate guidance and knowledge of students' cultures. Value sensitive design (VSD) accounts for human values in the design of technology. VSD can be used in the design of technological systems for helping CRT-related practices. However, the CRT context poses unique challenges due to the interactions between teachers' values and other socio-material factors such as students' values, community characteristics, and available resources. This preliminary study uses a low-fidelity cultural tool to elicit teachers' needs and values on CRT from various cultural backgrounds and educational settings. The results of the interview analysis provide an initial understanding of how needs, values, socio-material factors, and educational contexts are intertwined, and how they can be used to inform the design of technologies that assist teachers with CRT.",

One approach to reducing the negative effects of misinformation is through corrective information. However, it is possible that people develop counter-attitude towards the corrective information and reaffirm their belief in misinformation, called the boomerang effect. Fewer studies examined how different modes of corrective information about COVID-19 may address the boomerang effect. With a 3-by-3 between-subject experiment design (n = 210), we first presented one of the three modalities of misinformation (text, image, video) to the participants, followed by one of the three modalities of corrective information (text, image, video) to examine the effect of the corrective information. The results showed that there was no boomerang effect after correction in all modalities, indicating that all corrective information successfully reduced participants’ perceived credibility and potential action for misinformation. In the post-hoc analysis, the correction in the video mode worked best on text misinformation. Our results also suggested that image misinformation worked least effectively in terms of conveying misinformation. ",

We propose a video meeting system that utilizes a novel directional force feedback method so that people can efficiently guide each other's hand without the need for lengthy verbal explanations. The force feedback method uses asymmetric vibrations to create the illusion of directional pulling forces, which makes it possible to be built as a small and lightweight device. We also developed an online meeting system that allows a user to simply click a location on the remote user's video to move their hand towards the target location.",

      "abstract": "Shopping addiction is a destructive behavioral addiction characterized by compulsive purchasing with negative consequences for one’s finances and social well-being. In the current study, we conducted a literature review aimed at identifying difficulties in the self-monitoring of shopping behavior using existing technological solutions. Based on these results, we developed a guide for designing an online survey to explore the challenges and opportunities in applying social sensing to the problem of shopping addiction. The potential results of the online survey are expected to shed light on designing social sensing solutions to reduce shopping addiction. ",

Remote proceedings are likely to continue after the pandemic, making it imperative to strengthen evidence viewing and analysis for jurors. Our project addressed this problem by prototyping an assistive application that offered multiple points of view and evaluating it in a small user study. Five participants used the application to review case-specific exhibits in a hypothetical court session while thinking aloud. Participants were satisfied with the application, with almost no facilitation. We also identified the need to make a display of the setting in which the evidence was found more interactive and navigable.",

      "abstract": "Automated Decision Systems (ADS) are being used to inform important decisions in government services. Concerns regarding discrimination in ADS have led to the rise of bias mitigation techniques, or data science practices that measure and adjust for disparities based on protected class data. These techniques often require demographic or sensitive category data to both measure discrimination in ADS and process data to mitigate the discriminatory bias. The collection of sensitive category data increases privacy concerns. This preliminary study includes nine semi-structured interviews with data practitioners working in government. The analysis explores what considerations data practitioners in the public sector make when determining best practices for sensitive category data collection and how they engage with the tradeoff between privacy and right to freedom from discrimination. Themes pertinent to social services emerged including the importance of accessibility, reasons for data minimization and the role of reporting structures and historical norms.",

Designing user profiles is a process of designing users’ personal \"front.\" This study investigates profile elements across 110 SNS and identifies 62 elements with two groups of attributes: manually filled by users or automatically generated by the system, providing individual or social information. We annotated the presence of elements and whether they are optional or concealable. The most common elements are Profile Image, Bio Text, Username, Location, and Link to Other Social Media. We found SNS’ proportion of system-generated elements is positively correlated with social elements. SNS can be categorized into \"Real Life Mirror\" and \"Showcase as Need\" based on the number of profile elements and can be categorized into \"Resume\" and \"Convenient Social\" by the attributes of elements. We discuss the potential use of the data and the implications for future research.

We uncover that employers give additional effort to hire suitable candidates impeding their productivity.

      "abstract": "With the advent of COVID-19, new virtual social activities arose. These activities include virtual studying, which is studying while joining a video conference. Virtual studying is different from most virtual activities in that users try to minimize unnecessary interactions while sharing their presence through video streaming. Here, video streaming that runs in the background can cause problems such as invasion of privacy and excessive self-awareness. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether a new video conferencing interface that reduces video explicitness but detects important actions can mitigate the problems of video streaming and still deliver users’ presence in virtual studying. To this end, we designed a research prototype in three versions: blurred video version, small video version, and no video version. All versions were provided with an activity recognizer that detects absence, leaning, and using a smartphone. To evaluate the feasibility of the design, we conducted a user study where four virtual studying teams used all three versions of the prototype and participated in an interview. Our study explored the effects of new design strategies for virtual studying, which is a new virtual activity that focuses on sharing presence.",

      "abstract": "AI technologies are capable of improving the performance and productivity of teams in a variety of work contexts. These advantages may be optimized when the AI agent is considered a full team member. A vital component of the agent's acceptance as a team member or colleague is the degree to which its human coworkers feel they can trust it. To explore what factors affect the perceptions of an AI agent as a trustworthy team member and a legitimate colleague, we interviewed twenty-two professionals representing various work roles. Our results revealed that the following qualities contribute to professionals' trust in AI as a colleague: a visual presence reflective of coworkers, engagement in feedback loop and team processes through human communication, and the ability for self-development. These findings contribute to the CSCW community by advancing the current understanding of human-AI teaming and informing the design of trustworthy AI agents into the workplace. ",

AI recruitment software is used in all phases of the process, from receiving and sorting applications, candidate screening, selection process, and communication of results to applicants. While some argue that AI recruitment may remove interviewer bias, others believe there is a danger of dehumanizing the interviewees’ experience. In either case, AI recruitment is set to ignite a significant paradigm shift in hiring practices. For this poster, we discuss the results of a participatory speculative design project conducted to engage both HR recruiters and job applicants to understand their concerns. Specifically, we present six scenarios and a diegetic prototype that were used to familiarize participants with the AI recruitment process. We discuss how these served as catalysts for meaningful conversations about an often obfuscated topic.",

      "abstract": "Taking long series of screenshots for capturing and studying smartphone users’ phone usage and media consumption has recently attracted research attention due to its advantage of capturing rich contextual information from users' phone use journeys. However, that approach creates a high volume of screenshots that take very considerable time and effort to inspect and annotate, especially when the granularity of analysis is low: such as when distinguishing among media-content units (e.g, single FB posts) and detecting events in them. We therefore developed Screenshot Journey Auditor (SJA), a web application that identifies individual social media posts, and detects news items and other events of interest in them. It then visualizes users’ journeys ‘flow’ among these media-content units. SJA also enables researchers/coders to collaboratively correct detections online. We evaluated SJA with five coders and received positive feedback on how the detections and visualizations made the analysis process more efficient and informative.",

      "abstract": "In response to concerns about misleading content on social media, Twitter launched the ``Birdwatch'' initiative that allows volunteers to label and add context to tweets. We study data from Birdwatch to understand how users are performing ``data labor'' for Twitter, with implications for other platforms that are similarly reliant on data labor. We conduct computational analyses of Birdwatch text data and perform machine learning experiments to see how Birdwatch contributions might be used for classification. We find that Birdwatch users discuss distinct topics in domains like politics and news. While using Birdwatch data for content-only predictions may provide only small predictive power, in some cases Birdwatch data may be able to support ML systems. Furthermore, we see that the continuous flow of Birdwatch contributions provide great value in terms of supporting a ``guess most frequent`` baseline for classifying Twitter content.",

We demonstrate an alternative approach to online memorials that blends participatory memory with participatory design through remembrance artifacts that represent ideas for gun violence prevention technologies that could have prevented the tragedy and that may prevent future tragedies. We demonstrate participatory memory + design with our memorial called the OUrchive that supports retrospective and prospective reflection on the Oxford High School shooting through designing new use cases for AI to prevent mass shootings.

The study is motivated by gender disparities in harm through online dating, and the relative absence of dating app designs that prioritize women. Findings show that women are receptive to the notion of AI that augments their existing strategies for assessing risk of harm with meeting a particular user face-to-face. They outline various physical and non-physical harms that they attempt to reduce uncertainty about, and a range of data points as indicators of risk that could serve as the basis for a risk awareness AI model. Due to subjectivity in what is considered an indicator of risk, current findings suggest that risk awareness AI, if implemented, should allow women to train their own models.",

      "abstract": "Social-media influencers (SMIs) have created a wide range of content and research has shown that SMIs are perceived as credible by media consumers, and advertising by them can lead to higher user engagement than traditional advertising generally achieves. However, the factors that render SMIs more appealing than traditional media from an audience perspective have been underexplored. Using a grounded approach, we looked at the perceived appeal of SMIs of various types vs. traditional media by conducting semi-structured interviews with 20 of the former’s audience members. Our preliminary findings suggest that such appeal can be divided into four types: 1) initiative to summarize takeaways from multiple sources, 2) high independence and low interference, 3) distinctive and diverse networks and connections, and 4) relatability and applicability. This typology of appeal uncovers how SMIs have formed new media use patterns, and hopefully inform the design opportunities of social media platforms.",

      "abstract": "Conversation serves as one critical mechanism for knowledge-sharing and instruction-giving in collaborative work. Conversation allows people to take turns to make contributions, plan joint actions, align shared understanding of work status and resolve action failure. However, when such collaboration involves non-human AI actors like chatbots, there is a lack of understanding of how human participants may respond to the chatbot's prompts and guidance, and whether the interaction can similarly improve the actionability of instructions given to people. In this study, we prototyped a chatbot system, ActionaBot for providing task instructions to novice workers, and conducted an initial study to explore its effects on procedural instruction giving and following. Our results indicate that, novices although might perceive instructions to be inactionable due to prior experience and how instructions were authored, they were able to follow conversational guidance and willing to adapt to the chatbot through turn-taking to calibrate working states back-and-forth. Besides, users' awareness of the work status increased with the conversational prompts from the chatbot. ",

      "abstract": "Collaborating across language barriers is cognitively, communicatively and socially taxing, which may disincentivize people to continue working in a language-diverse team after experiencing it. It remains unclear how socially displaying potential collaborators' language and personal profiles in advance may affect multilingual team formation especially in computer-mediated virtual environments. We conducted an online study with native English speakers and native Japanese speakers in Gather Town. Participants were asked to complete a team formation and a slogan generation task under one of the following conditions - no profile display, constant profile display, and adaptive profile display. The profiles supplemented language and personal cues, and we investigated how participants' searching cost for potential conversational partners and their attitude towards multilingual teamwork shifted under these conditions. Our findings suggest different team formation strategies associated with language backgrounds in responding to different profile display designs. While English and Japanese native speakers held distinct attitudes toward working with language-divergent partners, introducing profile displays mitigated the attitudinal gap. We seek to further understand the language-technological effects on team formation, and explore design solutions to facilitate multilingual diversity in online teamwork.\r\n",

While many recent empirical and design studies have adopted these theoretical lenses, these conversations are often disconnected. Through a systematic literature review, we seek to understand patterns within and between decolonial computing and postcolonial computing. As an early step toward that objective, this poster presents results from our preliminary scientometric exploration of 115 papers' metadata and discusses research trends and popular publication venues in these areas. Using citation network analysis, we found smaller communities in decolonial and postcolonial computing scholarship based on their use of theoretical frameworks, objectives, types of papers, authors' collaboration and affiliations, and research sites and populations. We conclude by discussing future research directions to bring these communities into conversations with each other.",

However, it has not been fully understood as to how bureaucracy manifests in creator moderation. In this poster, we present an interview study with 28 YouTubers (i.e., video content creators) to analyze the bureaucracy of creator moderation from their moderation experiences. We found participants wrestled with bureaucracy as multiple obstructions in re-examining moderation decisions, coercion to appease different algorithms in creator moderation, and the platform’s indifference to participants’ labor. We discuss and contribute a conceptual understanding of how algorithmic and organizational bureaucracy intertwine in creator moderation, laying a solid ground for our future studies.",

      "abstract": "Students identifying with communities within the realm of immigration, including immigrants, refugees, international students, and undocumented individuals, often face difficulties navigating life in elite institutions of higher education. HCI scholars who have worked with migrant communities have called for future explorations on the role of participatory approaches in helping bring different stakeholders together to design for better technologies and socio-technical systems supporting their needs. In this paper we present preliminary findings from a participatory design study at an elite liberal-arts college in the U.S., exploring the role of an equity-centered hackathon-style event in bringing together different student communities on campus and collaboratively re-imagining today’s technologies and systems. We discuss possible best practices for designing inclusive and safe hackathon-style events for communities in the realm of immigration.",

Previous CSCW research has shown how technologies can support caregiving, but more research is needed to systematically understand how technology could support parents and other family caregivers as they adopt new coordination roles in their collaborations with each other. This paper reports findings from an interview study with parents of children hospitalized for cancer treatment. We used the Role Theory framework from the social sciences to show how parents adopt and enact caregiving roles during hospitalization and the challenges they experience as they adapt to this stressful situation. We show how parents experience 'role strain' as they attempt to divide caregiving work and introduce the concept of 'inter-caregiver information disparity.' We propose design opportunities for caregiving coordination technologies to better support caregiving roles in multi-caregiver teams.",

Prior studies investigate the topic of batching orders from a theoretical perspective, i.e., optimization, without taking contextual elements and worker preferences into account. In our paper, we elaborate on the couriers' perspectives and needs in batched order delivery based on a qualitative study. We identify several criteria used by couriers to accept and reject the batched orders. We propose an alternative order batching solution that supports courier needs.",

However, it is often challenging to have smooth and continuous conversations online with someone who they have never met in person. To handle this problem, we built a proof-of-concept system, Tomi, that dynamically suggests various conversation topic seeds related to the latest received messages in real-time. It selects a keyword from an incoming message and returns five contextually relevant topic seeds. In a qualitative study with eight dyads that simulated the common setting of online match-making, users could continue their conversations either by directly or indirectly utilizing the suggested topic seeds. Also, our system boosted their confidence during the chat. Lastly, we analyzed the trade-offs between several design alternatives and presented our reflections on a system supporting continuous conversations with diverse topics.",

      "abstract": "Online sexual risks pose a serious and frequent threat to adolescents' online safety. While significant work is done within the HCI community to understand teens' sexual experiences through public posts, we extend their research by qualitatively analyzing 156 private Instagram conversations flagged by 58 adolescents to understand the characteristics of sexual risks faced with strangers, acquaintances, and friends. We found that youth are often victimized by strangers through sexual solicitation/harassment as well as sexual spamming via text and visual media, which is often ignored by them. In contrast, adolescents' played mixed roles with acquaintances, as they were often victims of sexual harassment, but sometimes engaged in sexting, or interacted by rejecting sexual requests from acquaintances. Lastly, adolescents were never recipients of sexual risks with their friends, as they mostly mutually participated in sexting or sexual spamming. Based on these results, we provide our insights and recommendations for future researchers.",

Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI) is the field where studies with animals and technology are at the centre. However, within the CSCW and the ACI field, the equal participation from the animals’ viewpoint remains relatively human-centric, and how humans can collaborate with nonhuman animals remain underexplored. Research beyond human-centrism in other fields puts equal participation of nonhuman animals at the centre with the intention of equal inclusion. Thus, this poster introduces the initial results from a literature review on the previously published work in animal-inclusive and equity-oriented research fields with the purpose of opening a discussion on equity perspectives and equal participation of nonhuman animals in the CSCW work.",

Historically, women have faced multiple restrictions that have hindered their entry into professional ventures. These constraints are even more palpable in technical domains, due to the added sociocultural barriers in these fields which have relegated women's voices to the margins. Through a mixed-method comparative investigation of three professional development communities on Reddit - two focused on women, and one general professional online community serving as the baseline, we report and discuss the resilience-building, empowerment, and knowledge-development tactics that drive collective identity formation in these subreddits. The long-term goal of this work is to address the way in which such channels can be designed, maintained, and curated to offer spaces for enrichment, empowerment, and advocacy with a focus on professional development for women in technical domains.",

We conducted a nationally representative survey of 304 adults in the United States to investigate their attitudes towards sharing two types of COVID-19 health status (COVID-19 Diagnosis, Exposure to COVID-19) with three different audiences (Anyone, Frequent Contacts, Occasional Contacts). Using the Internet User's Information Privacy Concern (IUIPC) scale, we were able to identify the effect of different types of privacy concerns on sharing this information with various audiences. We found that privacy concerns around data Collection predicted lower willingness to share either type of health status to all of these audiences. However, desire for Control and for Awareness of data practices increased willingness to share health information with certain audiences. We discuss the implications of our findings.  ",

However, willingness to make such donations circumvents multiple important human factors that are little studied in the literature. Therefore, in this study, we survey 42 people in a developing country (Bangladesh) to investigate their willingness to donate to small-scale NPOs. Our findings reveal that people show a willingness to donate to small-scale NPOs that have an online presence and their lack of trust gets significantly reduced if those organizations have an online presence. We also find out several influential factors that inspire people to donate. Further, based on the feedback we receive, we identify design features that should be present in the online presence of small-scale NPOs.",

      "abstract": "Public coverage of ethical scandals in tech companies often portrays tech workers as uncaring or short-sighted in their ethical consideration. But how do tech students regard the connection between ethics and their future jobs? To explore ethics in the transition between academia and industry, we interviewed graduating computing students at the University of Colorado Boulder about their perspectives on ethical concerns in tech, decisions during job searches, and their ethics education. These interviews revealed that while students may value and understand ethics in tech, their belief that companies do not value ethics makes ethical consideration in the workplace daunting. In response, we suggest improving support for tech workers through academia-industry collaboration and additions to computing ethics curricula to help students stand up for responsible tech.",

      "abstract": "Online conversations through text have limitations in expressing emotions that can cause miscommunications across cultures. In this work, we study the Korean emotional expressions in text focusing on how people perceive emotional intentions through the use of emotion-expressing Korean characters. We define them as 'Korean emoticons' (`ㅋ', `ㅎ', `ㅠ'), onomatopoeic characters often used to express emotions for text-based communication. We examine the participants' understanding and usage of Korean emoticons by conducting an online survey asking to evaluate emotional contents of given sentences and interviews to explain personal experiences. We found that the different numbers of Korean emoticons used evoke different emotions, and that negative emoticons amplify positive emotions in positive contexts and positive emoticons alleviate negative emotions in negative contexts, while emoticons in neutral contexts have varying impacts depending on the context. We further discuss design implications on how text suggestion tools can support users taking emotional intentions into account. ",

This is desired due to the specific characteristics of ML modeling in practice, namely the complexity of ML, the interdisciplinary approach in industry, and the need for ML interpretability. In this work, we introduce an augmented reality-based system for collaborative immersive analytics that is designed to support ML modeling in interdisciplinary teams. We conduct a user study to examine how collaboration unfolds when users with different professional backgrounds and levels of ML knowledge interact in solving different ML tasks. Specifically, we use the pair analytics methodology and performance assessments to assess collaboration and explore their interactions with each other and the system. Based on this, we provide qualitative and quantitative results on both teamwork and taskwork during collaboration. Our results show how our system elicits sustained collaboration as measured along six distinct dimensions. We finally make recommendations how immersive systems should be designed to elicit sustained collaboration in ML modeling. ",

      "abstract": "Bots are increasingly being used for governance-related purposes in online communities, yet no instrumentation exists for measuring how users assess their beneficial or detrimental impacts. In order to support future human-centered and community-based research, we developed a new scale called GOVernance Bots in Online communiTies (GOV-BOTs) across two rounds of surveys on Reddit (N=820). We applied rigorous psychometric criteria to demonstrate the validity of GOV-BOTs, which contains two subscales: bot governance (4 items) and bot tensions (3 items). Whereas humans have historically expected communities to be composed entirely of humans, the social participation of bots as non-human agents now raises fundamental questions about psychological, philosophical, and ethical implications. Addressing psychological impacts, our data show that perceptions of effective bot governance positively contribute to users’ sense of virtual community (SOVC), whereas perceived bot tensions may only impact SOVC if users are more aware of bots. Finally, we show that users tend to experience the greatest SOVC across groups of subreddits, rather than individual subreddits, suggesting that future research should carefully re-consider uses and operationalizations of the term \"community.\"",

We examine the characteristics of the popular images shared on Twitter as part of ``Stop the Steal'', the widespread misinformation campaign during the 2020 U.S. election. We analyze the spread of the forty images that were shared the most on Twitter as part of this campaign. Using a coding process, we categorize and label the images according to their type, content, origin, and role, and perform a mixed-method analysis of these images’ spread on Twitter. Our results show that popular images include both photographs and text rendered as image. Only very few of these popular images included alleged photographic evidence of fraud; and none of the popular photographs had been manipulated. Most images reached a significant portion of their total spread within several hours from their first appearance, and popular- and less-popular accounts were both involved in various stages of their spread.",

      "abstract": "Datafication, which is the process in which children's actions online are pervasively recorded, tracked, aggregated, analysed, and exploited by online services in multiple ways that include behavioural engineering, and monetisation, is becoming increasing common in the online world today. However, we know little about how children feel about such practices and how they perceive datification. Through online interviews with 48 children aged 7-13 from UK schools, we examined how children perceive datafication practices, especially how such practices could make inference on them. We identified three key knowledge gaps in children's perceptions, including their lack of recognition of who were involved in the data processing and how, data being transmitted across platforms, and their data ownership. Through situating our findings under a critical algorithmic literacy framework, our findings provided some immediate indications regarding how we could better support children in the datafied society through more transparency and autonomy-supportive designs, as well as the need for a fundamental shift of the current data governance structure.

      "abstract": "We investigate the privacy practices of labor organizers in the computing technology industry and explore the changes in these practices as a response to remote work. Our study is situated at the intersection of two pivotal shifts in workplace dynamics: (a) the increase in online workplace communications due to remote work, and (b) the resurgence of the labor movement and an increase in collective action in workplaces—especially in the tech industry, where this phenomenon has been dubbed the tech worker movement. The shift of work-related communications to online digital platforms in response to an increase in remote work is creating new opportunities for and risks to the privacy of workers. These risks are especially significant for organizers of collective action, with several well-publicized instances of retaliation against labor organizers by companies.\r\n     \r\nThrough a series of qualitative interviews with 29 tech workers involved in collective action, we investigate how labor organizers assess and mitigate risks to privacy while engaging in these actions. Among the most common risks that organizers experienced are retaliation from their employer, lateral worker conflict, emotional burnout, and the possibility of information about the collective effort leaking to management. Depending on the nature and source of the risk, organizers use a blend of digital security practices and community-based mechanisms. Digital security practices tended to be more relevant when the threat primarily came from management, while the latter strategies, such as community management and discussion moderation, were central to protecting collective action participants from lateral worker conflict.\r\n    \r\nSince labor organizing is a collective rather than individual project, individual privacy and collective privacy are intertwined, sometimes in conflict and often mutually constitutive. Notions of privacy that solely center individuals are often incompatible with the needs of organizers, who noted that safety in numbers could only be achieved when workers presented a united front to management. Based on our interviews, we identify key topics for future research, such as the growing prevalence of surveillance software and the needs of international and gig worker organizers. We conclude with design recommendations that can help create safer, more secure and more private tools to better address the risks that organizers face. ",

      "abstract": "Some life transitions can be difficult to discuss on social media, especially with networks of known ties, due to challenges such as stigmatization. Separate online networks can provide alternative spaces to discuss life transitions. To understand why and how people turn to separate networks, we interviewed 28 participants who had recently experienced life transitions. While prior research tends to focus on one life transition in isolation, this work examines social media sharing behaviors across a wide variety of life transitions. We describe how people often turn to separate networks during life transitions due to challenges faced in networks of known ties, yet encounter new challenges such as difficulty locating these networks. We describe support from waiting contributors and virtual friends. Finally, we provide insight into how online separate networks can be better designed through enhancing search functionality, promoting contribution, and providing context-sensitive templates for sharing in online spaces.\r\n",

Using qualitative methods, we analyzed 24 interviews with TikTok users to explore how algorithmic personalization processes inform people’s understanding of their identities as well as shape their orientation to others. Building on insights from our qualitative data and previous scholarship on algorithms and identity, we propose a novel conceptual model to understand how people think about and interact with personalized algorithmic systems. Drawing on the metaphor of crystals and their properties, the \\textit{algorithmic crystal framework} is an analytic frame that captures user understandings of how personalized algorithms (1) interact with user identity by \\textit{reflecting} user self-concepts that are both \\textit{multifaceted} and \\textit{dynamic} and (2) shape perspectives on others encountered through the algorithm, by orienting users to recognize parts of themselves \\textit{refracted} in other users and to experience ephemeral, \\textit{diffracted} connections with groups of similar others. We describe how the algorithmic crystal framework can extend theory and inform new lines of research around the implications of algorithms in self-concept development and social life.",

Tourgether360 enhances social exploration of 360° tour videos using a pseudo-spatial navigation technique that provides both an overhead “context” view of the environment as a minimap, as well as a shared pseudo-3D environment for exploring the video. Collaborators are embodied as avatars along a track depending on their position in the video timeline and can point and synchronize their playback. We evaluated the Tourgether360 concept through two studies: first, a comparative study with a simplified version of Tourgether360 with collaborator embodiments and a minimap versus a conventional interface; second, an  exploratory study where we studied how collaborators used Tourgether360 to navigate and explore 360° environments together. We found that participants adopted the Tourgether360 approach with ease and enjoyed the shared social aspects of the experience. Participants reported finding the experience similar to an interactive social video game. ",

      "abstract": "In recent years, China has witnessed the proliferation and success of the online food delivery industry, an emerging type of the gig economy. Online food deliverers who deliver the food from restaurants to customers play a critical role in enabling this industry. Mediated by algorithms and coupled with interactions with multiple stakeholders, this emerging kind of labor has been taken by millions of people. In this paper, we present a mixed-methods analysis to investigate this labor of online food deliverers and uncover how the mediation of algorithms shapes it. Combining large-scale quantitative data-driven investigations of 100,000 deliverers' behavioral data with in-depth qualitative interviews with 15 online food deliverers, we demonstrate their working activities, identify how algorithms mediate their delivery procedures, and reveal how they perceive their relationships with different stakeholders as a result of their algorithm-mediated labor. Our findings provide important implications for enabling better experiences and more humanized labor of deliverers as well as workers in gig economies of similar kinds.",

      "abstract": "Smart speakers have become exceedingly popular and entered many people's homes due to their ability to engage users with natural conversations. Researchers have also looked into using smart speakers as an interface to collect self-reported health data through conversations. Responding to surveys prompted by smart speakers requires users to listen to questions and answer in voice without any visual stimuli. Compared to traditional web-based surveys, where users can see questions and answers visually, voice surveys may be more cognitively challenging. Therefore, to collect reliable survey data, it is important to understand what types of questions are suitable to be administered by smart speakers. We selected five common survey questionnaires and deployed them as voice surveys and web surveys in a within-subject study. Our 24 participants answered questions using voice and web questionnaires in one session. They then repeated the same study session after 1 week to provide a \"retest\" response. Our results suggest that voice surveys have comparable reliability to web surveys. We find that, when using 5-point or 7-point scales, voice surveys take about twice as long as web surveys. Based on objective measurements, such as response agreement and test-retest reliability, and subjective evaluations of user experience, we recommend that researchers consider adopting the binary scale and 5-point numerical scales for voice surveys on smart speakers.",

      "abstract": "Recent advantages from computational linguists can be leveraged to nudge students with adaptive self-evaluation based on their argumentation skill level. To investigate how individual argumentation self-evaluation will help students write more convincing texts, we designed an intelligent argumentation writing support system called ArgumentFeedback based on nudging theory and evaluated it in a series of three qualitative and quantitative studies with a total of 83 students. We found that students who received a self-evaluation nudge wrote more convincing texts with a better quality of formal and perceived argumentation compared to the control group. The measured self-efficacy and the technology acceptance provide promising results for embedding adaptive argumentation writing support tools in combination with digital nudging in traditional learning settings to foster self-regulated learning. Our results indicate that the design of nudging-based learning applications for self-regulated learning combined with computational methods for argumentation self-evaluation has a beneficial use to foster better writing skills of students.",

      "abstract": "The severe impact of COVID-19 in the United States has forced many students to replace in-person socialization with online digital contact. In this study, we investigate the mental health impacts associated with this shift by examining properties of online interactions that may affect loneliness and perceived social support. Students were surveyed (N=827) across 97 universities across the US during their first full semester impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (Fall 2020). Private online interactions (messaging, phone call, video call) were found to have a comparable correlation to social support as face-to-face interactions, but public online interactions (social media) were associated with more negative outcomes. Among private platforms, messaging had the strongest correlation with social support; and daily self-disclosure over messaging yielded social support levels that were 1.21x higher than rarely or never disclosing over this platform. We speculate that factors such as the level of privacy and peoples' feelings of control contributed to disclosure and perceived social support in online platforms.",

      "abstract": "Calling out, a phenomenon where people publicly broadcast their critiques of someone to a larger audience, has become increasingly common on social media. However, there have been concerns that it could develop into harassment, deteriorating the quality of public discourse by over-punishing individuals. To study this, we interviewed 32 Twitter users who had been called out, had called out, or had witnessed a calling out on Twitter. We found that a key determining factor that distinguishes criticism from harassment was the callee’s ability to respond to or engage with the criticism, and that different stakeholders hold different perspectives toward how online harassment is defined. We also discovered that the distinction between callers and callees was not absolute, and that there was high interchangeability of roles both within and across events. Through these findings, we discuss design implications for the platform in promoting healthy discourse while preventing toxic behavior on social media.",

      "abstract": "Using human intelligence to identify news articles' political stances is common in research and practical applications. But human judgement can be biased and prone to errors stemming from the comprehension of tasks and political alignment. This paper proposes a relative rating method based on news articles' stances relative to raters' own stances to avoid comprehension inconsistency and to control for human bias in crowdsourced stance detection of news articles. We also show how to use the relative ratings to construct a measure for raters' stances on a political topic and to identify raters whose ratings are of higher quality than others. We implement our proposed methods in an online experiment that recruits Amazon Mechanical Turk users as raters for news articles on Gun Control. Using the data from the experiment, we find evidence that raters' own stances on Gun Control significantly impact ratings of related news articles, both at the individual levels and at the aggregate levels. We also present evidence that our relative-rating-based stance measure captures more information about raters' actual stances than their self-reported stance does. ",

Yet, such asymmetrical collaboration configurations are common today for many design tasks, due to the geographical distance of people or unusual circumstances such as a lockdown. We conducted a first study to investigate trade-offs of three remote representations of an AR workspace: a fully virtual representation, a first-person view, and an external view. Building on our findings, we designed ARgus, a multi-view video-mediated communication system that combines these representations through interactive tools for navigation, previewing, pointing, and annotation. We report on a second user study that observed how 12 participants used ARgus to provide remote instructions for an AR furniture arrangement task. Participants extensively used its view transition tools, while the system reduced their reliance on verbal instructions.",

      "abstract": "Inadequate sign language data currently impedes advancement of sign language ML and AI. Training on existing datasets results in limited models due to small size, and lack of diverse signers in real-world settings. Complex labeling problems in particular often limit scale. In this work, we explore the potential for crowdsourcing to help overcome these barriers. To do this, we ran a user study with exploratory crowdsourcing tasks designed to support scalability: 1) to record videos of specific content -- thereby enabling automatic, scalable labeling -- and 2) to perform quality control checks for execution consistency -- further reducing post-processing requirements. We also provided workers with a searchable view of the crowdsourced dataset, to boost engagement and transparency and align with Deaf community values. Our user study included 29 participants using our exploratory tasks to record 1906 videos and perform 2331 quality control checks. Our results suggest that a crowd of signers may be able to generate high-quality recordings and perform reliable quality control, and that the signing community values visibility into the resulting dataset.",

      "abstract": "A successful digital society is, in part, predicated on people having secure access to digitally-delivered services when they need it. It has long been recognised that parts of society are not able to access digital services without assistance, often as a result of economic precarity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of third and voluntary sector organisations in providing assisted digital access has come to the fore. As access\r\nto essential everyday services moved to digital-only and family and friendship networks of support became disrupted by the pandemic, for many, voluntary and third sector organisations were the source of digital assistance to claim welfare, pay bills, take part in education and purchase food. Our study explores the types of assisted digital access that voluntary and third sector organisations have provided thus far during the COVID-19 pandemic. We capture the dimensions of this assistance and evaluate the steps such organisations take to ensure that this access is safe for both the assister and assisted. From these findings we set out a security strategy with supporting design principles that combines digital security with human security in a security approach we term ’positive-first’.",

      "abstract": "Blind and low vision people use visual description services (VDS) to gain visual interpretation and build access in a world that privileges sight. Despite its many benefits, VDS has many harmful privacy and security implications. As a result, researchers are suggesting, exploring, and building obfuscation systems that detect and obscure private or sensitive materials. However, as obfuscation depends largely on sight to interpret outcomes, it is unknown whether Blind and low vision people would find such approaches useful. Our work aims to center the perspectives and opinions of Blind and low vision people on the potential of obfuscation to address privacy concerns in VDS. By reporting on interviews with 20 Blind and low vision people who use VDS, our findings reveal that popular research trends in obfuscation fail to capture the needs of Blind and low vision people.  While obfuscation might be helpful in gaining more control, tensions around obfuscation misrecognition and confirmation are prominent. We turn to the framework of interdependence to unpack and understand obfuscation in VDS, enabling us to complicate privacy concerns, uncover the labor of Blind and low vision people, and emphasize the importance of safeguards. We provide design directions to move the trajectory of obfuscation research forward.",

      "abstract": "There is a concerning lack of clear and accurate information around accessing public benefits for asylum applicants in the United States (U.S.), which has been shown to negatively affect their healthcare engagement. Digital tools such as websites and mobile applications can be a potentially promising way to disseminate public benefits information to asylum applicants. The goal of this study is to understand the current informational needs of asylum applicants in the U.S. seeking legal information and resources regarding their individual rights to public health benefits and services. Through semi-structured interviews with 24 asylum applicants currently in the U.S. and 13 healthcare and legal professionals working with asylum applicants and other immigrants, we identify four key challenges and barriers to using currently available digital tools: information uncertainty, accessibility, emotional barriers, and contextual sensitivity. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multiple stakeholders' perspectives when designing tools within the immigration informational space. We provide targeted design recommendations to create digital tools for asylum seekers and the stakeholders who support them. ",

      "abstract": "Alongside recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), a new art practice has emerged in recent years that borrows and transforms these advances in the production of artworks. The actors of this emergent practice are coming from contemporary art, media and digital arts. These artists have developed an original practice of AI within their creative field. In this article, we propose a qualitative study to explore the nature of this practice. We interviewed five internationally renowned artists about how AI is integrated into their work. Through a thematic analysis of the interviews, we first find that their practice relies on crafting algorithms and data as materials. We uncover how they explicitly use this material unpredictability rather than avoid it. Secondly, we highlight the politics of their practice that consist of resisting the culture of AI research, as well as its inherent power dynamics. We also highlight how their relationship with the technology is imbued with ethics and how they rethink their role with respect to the technology. In this paper, we aim to provide the CSCW community with a way to expand the framework in which AI can be understood not only as a tool but also as cultural and political design material.",

      "abstract": "The scale of scientific publishing continues to grow, creating overload on science journalists who are inundated with choices for what would be most interesting, important, and newsworthy to cover in their reporting. This work addresses this problem by considering the viability of creating a predictive model of newsworthiness of scientific articles that is trained using crowdsourced evaluations of newsworthiness. We proceed by first assessing the potential of crowd-sourced evaluations of newsworthiness by assessing their alignment with expert ratings of newsworthiness, analyzing both quantitative correlations and qualitative rating rationale to understand limitations. We then demonstrate and evaluate a predictive model trained on these crowd ratings together with arXiv article metadata, text, and other computed features. Based on the crowdsourcing protocol we developed, we find that while crowdsourced ratings of newsworthiness often align moderately with expert ratings there are also notable differences and divergences which limit the approach. Yet despite these limitations we also find that the predictive model we built provides a reasonably precise set of rankings when validated against expert evaluations (P@10 = 0.8, P@15 = 0.67), suggesting that a viable signal can be learned from crowdsourced evaluations of newsworthiness. Based on these findings we discuss opportunities for future work to leverage crowdsourcing and predictive approaches to support journalistic work in discovering and filtering newsworthy information.

While there is extensive work on CRDTs for plain text, much less is known about CRDTs for rich text with formatting. No algorithms have been published, and existing open-source implementations do not always preserve user intent.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we describe a model of intent preservation in rich text editing, developed through a series of concurrent editing scenarios. We then describe Peritext, a CRDT algorithm for rich text that satisfies the criteria of our model. The key idea is to store formatting spans alongside the plaintext character sequence, linked to a stable identifier for the first and last character of each span, and then to derive the final formatted text from these spans in a deterministic way that ensures concurrent operations commute.\r\n\r\nWe have prototyped our algorithm in TypeScript, validated it using randomized property-based testing, and integrated it with an editor UI. We also prove that our algorithm ensures convergence, and demonstrate its causality preservation and intention preservation properties.",

      "abstract": "The study of eating disorders online has a long tradition within CSCW and HCI scholarship. Research within this corpus highlights the types of content people with eating disorders post as well as the ways in which individuals use online spaces for acceptance, connection, and support. Despite nearly a decade of research, online eating disorder scholarship in CSCW and HCI rarely accounts for the ways gender shapes online engagement. In this paper, we present empirical results from interviews with 14 trans people with eating disorders. We demonstrate how working with gender as an analytic lens allowed us to produce new knowledge about the embodiment of participation in online eating disorder spaces. We highlight how trans people with eating disorders use online eating disorder content to inform and set goals for their bodies, such as throughout gender transition, and how, as gender minorities within online eating disorder spaces, trans people occupy marginal positions that make them more susceptible to harm, including threats to eating disorder validity and gender authenticity. In our discussion, we consider life transitions in the context of gender and eating disorders, addressing how online eating disorder spaces operate as social transition machinery. We also call attention to the labor associated with online participation as a gender minority within online eating disorder spaces, outlining several design recommendations for supporting how trans people with eating disorders use online spaces. CONTENT WARNING: This study is about the online experiences of trans people with eating disorders. We discuss eating disorders as well as related content (e.g., thinspiration) and practices (e.g., binge eating, restriction). We also discuss gender dysphoria. Please read with caution.",

      "abstract": "The subreddit r/The_Donald was repeatedly denounced as a toxic and misbehaving online community, reasons for which it faced a sequence of moderation interventions by Reddit administrators. It was quarantined in June 2019, restricted in February 2020, and finally banned in June 2020, but despite precursory work on the matter, the effects of this sequence of interventions are still unclear. In this work, we follow a multidimensional causal inference approach, with data containing more than 15M posts made in a time frame of 2 years, to examine the effects of such interventions inside and outside of the subreddit. We find that the interventions greatly reduced the activity of problematic users. However, the interventions also caused an increase in toxicity and led users to share more polarized and less factual news. In addition, the restriction had stronger effects than the quarantine, and core users of r/The_Donald suffered stronger effects than the rest of users. Overall, our results provide evidence that the interventions had mixed effects and paint a nuanced picture of the consequences of community-level moderation strategies. We conclude by reflecting on the challenges of policing online platforms and on the implications for the design and deployment of moderation interventions.",

      "abstract": "A detailed understanding of the mental health needs of people from refugee backgrounds is important for the design of inclusive mental health technologies and services. We present a qualitative account of the digital mental health experiences of women from refugee backgrounds. Working with community members and community workers of a charitable organisation for refugee women in the UK, we identify social and structural challenges, including loneliness and access to mental health technologies. Nonetheless, participants’ accounts document their collective agency in addressing these challenges and supporting social connectedness and personal wellbeing in daily life: participants reported taking part in community activities as volunteers, sharing technological expertise, and using a wide range of non-mental health-focused technologies to support their mental health, from playing games to using religious apps. Our findings suggest that, rather than focusing only on self-help and self-care, research also needs to leverage community-driven approaches to foster social mental health experiences, from altruism to connectedness and belonging.",

      "abstract": "Studies on depression in the workplace have mostly investigated its impact on individual employees. Little is known about its association with the company as a whole, or the state where the company is based. This is due to the lack of scalable methodologies operationalizing depression in the specific context of the workplace, and of data  documenting potential distress. In this work, we adapted a work-related depression scale called Occupational Depression Inventory (ODI), gathered more than 350K employee reviews of 104 major companies across the whole US for the (2008-2020) years, and developed a deep-learning framework (called AutoODI) scoring these reviews on a composite ODI score. Presence of ODI mentions manifested itself not only at micro-level (companies scoring high in ODI suffered from low stock growth) but also at macro-level (states hosting these companies were associated with high depression rates, talent shortage, and economic deprivation). This new way of applying AutoODI onto company reviews offers both theoretical implications for the literature in computational social science, occupational health and economic geography, and practical implications for companies and policy makers.",

Most previous works focused on assessing user reliance, and more broadly trust, retrospectively, through user perceptions and task-based measures. In this work, we explore the relationship between eye gaze and reliance under varying task difficulty and AI performance levels in a spatial reasoning task. Our results show a strong positive correlation between total percent gaze duration on the AI suggestion and user AI task agreement, as well as user perceived reliance. Moreover, user agency is preserved particularly when the task is easy and when AI performance is low or inconsistent. Our results also reveal nuanced differences between reliance and trust. We discuss the potential of using eye gaze to gauge human reliance on AI in real-time, enabling adaptive AI assistance for optimal human-AI team performance.",

      "abstract": "People integrate digital services into their day-to-day lives, often with the assumption that they will always be available. What happens when these services close down? The introduction of services might be carefully planned, but their closure may not benefit from the same degree of consideration. A more developed understanding of the effects of closures might make it possible to minimize negative consequences for users. This paper builds on sustainability, digital memories, and collaborative-work research through an empirical investigation of service closure. Fifty-five participants completed a questionnaire that solicited experiences of service closure and attitudes toward prospective closure. Through a qualitative analysis of participant responses, we synthesized six themes that reflected the practical and emotional effects of service closure on people: disempowerment, disconnection, loss of capability, trust, time and effort, and notice periods. We make suggestions for ways that service features related to these themes might be managed during closure, but also identify less tractable challenges: as part of this investigation, we introduce and develop the concept of \\emph{service patinas} to describe the important but entirely service-bound data that contextualize digital artefacts.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Mobile mental health applications are seen as a promising way to fulfill the growing need for mental health care. Although there are more than ten thousand mental health apps available on app marketplaces, such as Google Play and Apple App Store, many of them are not evidence-based, or have been minimally evaluated or regulated. The real-life experience and concerns of the app users are largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed 2159 user reviews from 117 Android apps and 2764 user reviews from 76 iOS apps. Our findings include the critiques around inconsistent moderation standards and lack of transparency. App-embedded social features and chatbots were criticized for providing little support during crises. We provide research and design implications for future mental health app developers, discuss the necessity of developing a comprehensive and centralized app development guideline, and the opportunities of incorporating existing AI technology in mental health chatbots.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the findings from a series of participatory design workshops with LGBTQ people living in the rural Midwestern United States. Using future workshops as a method, we seek to understand contemporary problems facing rural LGBTQ people and leverage design exercises to facilitate community members to come up with creative solutions. What we find are people grappling with the complexities of visibility, safety, and resource access in their rural communities; people who wanted to be able to use and create sociotechnical solutions that could help them navigate these complexities. Drawing on these findings, we argue for further exploration of design that experiments with the tension between visibility and safety for LGBTQ people. Further, we argue that future workshops and participatory design are well-positioned for continued work with marginalized communities, but that we need to maintain political orientations towards liberation and justice.

We identified that the importance of storytelling in Appalachian culture made digital storytelling an effective means of teaching these skills to residents. However, the poor technology infrastructure at our study site posed challenges to our participants' ability to use technology and learn new skills. We found that poor infrastructure reinforces low self-efficacy, discouraging participants from using technology. In environments where computers are often slow and unreliable, it is not possible to form realistic expectations of how a computer should act. Therefore, it becomes difficult for users to untangle if the issues they encounter are because of usage errors or the technology. These findings highlight how infrastructure and self-efficacy should be accounted for together when conducting rural HCI research.",

      "abstract": "Workers from a variety of industries rapidly shifted to remote work at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. While existing work has examined the impact of this shift on office workers, little work has examined how shifting from in-person to online work affected workers in the informal labor sector. We examine the impact of shifting from in-person to online-only work on a particularly marginalized group of workers: sex workers. Through 34 qualitative interviews with sex workers from seven countries in the Global North, we examine how a shift to online-only sex work impacted: (1) working conditions, (2) risks and protective behaviors, and (3) labor rewards. We find that online work offers benefits to sex workers' financial and physical well-being. However, online-only work introduces new and greater digital and mental health risks as a result of the need to be publicly visible on more platforms and to share more explicit content. From our findings we propose design and platform governance suggestions for digital sex workers and for informal workers more broadly, particularly those who create and sell digital content.",

In this contribution, we present a novel system for the facilitation of small group online discussions using an avatar during video conferencing. The avatar was programmed with group facilitation best practices, whereas the content for the activities was prepared by the classes' teachers. Groups of tenth grade students interacted with the system, where we compared activities facilitated by the avatar with activities without facilitation. Our results show that students reported the activity with the avatar to be significantly more efficient, more understandable and inducing more participation compared to activities without avatar facilitation. Students also spoke significantly more with avatar facilitation. This system shows promise in future online educational activities as a facilitator of discussions with K-12 students.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes how the contemporary technology innovation ecology is hostile to community-driven design. These hostilities are important to understand if we want to intervene in the policy landscape of technology innovation to support viable alternatives to big tech consolidation and more democratic ways of developing and maintaining technology. We contribute a thick description of the hostile ecologies faced by transportation workers, community organizers, and allied technology researchers as they work toward building a cooperatively-owned taxi business with a digital dispatching technology. Our findings show that the hostile innovation ecology manifests as constrained access to resources, an inequitable regulatory framework, diminished agency in the software design process, and limits to the will of our community partners. We discuss the paths toward innovation for United Taxi Workers San Diego as compared with transportation network companies (e.g. Lyft, Uber) in terms of access to funding, regulation, labor, expertise, and market. We argue that a critical examination of institutions and polices in the innovation ecology is a necessary step toward charting fair, equitable, and community-strengthening pathways for technology innovation in the future.",

      "abstract": "Early recovery after substance use disorder (SUD) treatment is a high-risk period. The majority of people will relapse, often within weeks of completing treatment. In the modern era, re-entry upon completion of treatment includes both digital and non-digital spaces. Digital spaces, including social media, present unique challenges to the recovery journey. However, research has rarely focused on the ways in which technology affects this critical period. We conducted in-depth interviews with 29 participants (8 recoverees and 21 support professionals) across two treatment sites to explore this gap. Using an inductive thematic approach, we gained insights into digital social re-entry, a term that we introduce to describe the process of re-engaging with social spaces online. We describe the work of digital social re-entry, which includes 1) remaking social networks, 2) maintaining boundaries, 3) managing triggering content, 4) resisting access to substances, and 5) shifting personal identity. We conclude by characterizing strategies for navigating digital social re-entry and discussing ways to better support recoverees during this aspect of their recovery journey.",

      "abstract": "Headlines play a critical role in how users perceive articles. But many headline publishers craft headlines in ways that either attract clicks in an attempt to earn ad revenue, or misinform users or manipulate their opinions for malicious intents.\r\nSuch headlines can do harm since many users simply skim and share headlines without reading the articles in full. We present an exploratory browser extension that empowers users to suggest headlines they deem better for news articles. Users can view headlines suggested by other users that they follow as they browse websites. We conducted a study of 27 users who used the extension for one week to read news and suggest headlines.\r\nWe found that users saw value in the tool and used it to change headlines that they found in need of improvement. We characterize the changes that people make to headlines if enabled. We also report on a followup study we conducted with 312 participants to evaluate headlines suggested by the tool. The purpose of the study was to examine whether headlines suggested by untrained users could be preferred over original headlines by professional editors. We found that a significant number of the suggested headlines were indeed preferred.\r\nOur work explores the designs for, and opportunities and consequences of, empowering news consumers by giving them control over the content curation process.",

      "abstract": "With increasing attention to online anti-social behaviors such as personal attacks and bigotry, it is critical to have an accurate accounting of how widespread anti-social behaviors are. In this paper, we empirically measure the prevalence of anti-social behavior in one of the world's most popular online community platforms. We operationalize this goal as measuring the proportion of unmoderated comments in the 97 most popular communities on Reddit that violate eight widely accepted platform norms. To achieve this goal, we contribute a human-AI pipeline for identifying these violations and a bootstrap sampling method to quantify measurement uncertainty. We find that 6.25% (95% Confidence Interval [5.36%, 7.13%]) of all comments in 2016, and 4.28% (95% CI [2.50%, 6.26%]) in 2020-2021, are violations of these norms. Most anti-social behaviors remain unmoderated: moderators only removed one in twenty violating comments in 2016, and one in ten violating comments in 2020. Personal attacks were the most prevalent category of norm violation; pornography and bigotry were the most likely to be moderated, while politically inflammatory comments and misogyny/vulgarity were the least likely to be moderated. This paper offers a method and set of empirical results for tracking these phenomena as both the social practices (e.g., moderation) and technical practices (e.g., design) evolve.",

      "abstract": "The algorithms and the interactions facilitated by online platforms have been used by radical groups to recruit vulnerable individuals to their cause. This has resulted in the sharp growth of violent events and deteriorating online discourse. The Manosphere, a collection of radical anti-feminist communities, is one such group that has attracted attention due to its rapid growth and increasingly violent real-world outbursts. In this paper, we examine the social engagements between Reddit users who have participated in feminist discourse and the Manosphere communities on Reddit to understand the process of development of traits associated with the adoption of extremist ideologies. By using existing research on the psychology of radicalization we track how specific types of social engagement with the Manosphere influence the development of traits associated with radicalization. Our findings show that: (1) participation, even by the simple act of joining the Manosphere, has a significant influence on the language and outlook traits of a user, (2) Manosphere elites are extremely effective propagators of radical traits and cause their increase even outside the Manosphere, and (3) community perception can heavily influence a user’s behavior. Finally, we examine how our findings can help draft community and platform moderation policies to help mitigate the problem of online radicalization.",

      "abstract": "People often take user ratings/reviews into consideration when shopping for products or services online. However, such user-generated data contains self-selection bias that could affect people’s decisions and it is hard to resolve this issue completely by algorithms. In this work, we propose to raise people’s awareness of the self-selection bias by making three types of information concerning user ratings/reviews transparent. We distill these three pieces of information, i.e., reviewers’ experience, the extremity of emotion, and reported aspect(s), from the definition of self-selection bias and exploration of related literature. We further conduct an online survey to assess people’s perceptions of the usefulness of such information and identify the exact facets (e.g., negative emotion) people care about in their decision process. Then, we propose a visual design to make such details behind user reviews transparent and integrate the design into an experimental website for evaluation. The results of a between-subjects study demonstrate that our bias-aware design significantly increases people’s awareness of bias and their satisfaction with decision-making. We further offer a series of design implications for improving information transparency and awareness of bias in user-generated content.",

However, answer posts in CQA platforms could be too unstructured and overwhelming to be easily applied to AP construction, as validated by our formative study for understanding relevant user challenges. We therefore proposed an answer-post processing pipeline, based on which we built PlanHelper, a tool assisting users in processing the CQA information and constructing AP interactively. We conducted a within-subject study (N=24) with a Quora-like interface as the baseline. Results suggested that when creating AP with PlanHelper, users were significantly more satisfied with the informational support and more engaged during the interaction. Moreover, we performed an in-depth analysis on the user behaviors with PlanHelper and summarized the design considerations for such supporting tools.",

The esports industry has seen various attempts at governance structure but is yet to form a consensus. In this study, we explore esports governance in League of Legends (LoL), a major esports title. Through a two-stage, mixed-methods analysis of rule enforcement that Riot Games, LoL’s developer and publisher, has performed against esports participants such as professional players and teams, we qualitatively describe rule breaking behaviors and penalties in LoL esports, and quantitatively measure how contextual factors such as time, perpetrator identity, and region might influence governance outcomes. These findings about rule enforcement allow us to characterize the esports governance of LoL as top-down and paternalistic, and to reflect upon professional players' work and professionalization in the esports context. We conclude by discussing translatable implications for esports governance practice and research.",

      "abstract": "Previous work suggests that people's preference for different kinds of information depends on more than just accuracy. This could happen because the messages contained within different pieces of information may either be well-liked or repulsive. Whereas factual information must often convey uncomfortable truths, misinformation can have little regard for veracity and leverage psychological processes which increase its attractiveness and proliferation on social media. In this review, we argue that when misinformation proliferates, this happens because the social media environment enables adherence to misinformation by reducing, rather than increasing, the psychological cost of doing so. We cover how attention may often be shifted away from accuracy and towards other goals, how social and individual cognition is affected by misinformation and the cases under which debunking it is most effective, and how the formation of online groups affects information consumption patterns, often leading to more polarization and radicalization. Throughout, we make the case that polarization and misinformation adherence are closely tied. We identify ways in which the psychological cost of adhering to misinformation can be increased when designing anti-misinformation interventions or resilient affordances, and we outline open research questions that the CSCW community can take up in further understanding this cost.",

      "abstract": "Adverse Childhood Events (ACEs) are potentially traumatic events that occur in childhood (e.g. sexual abuse and maternal violence). Clinical research highlights the significant impact ACES have on youth’s mental health similar to other youth-related issues like traditional bullying and cyberbullying. However, research focused on the intersection of these two are limited. We report the results from a qualitative study that used electronic health record (EHR) data and clinical narratives from Parkview Behavioral Health hospital (n=719) to better understand the presentation of ACEs in patients who indicated cyber/bullying contributed to their inpatient hospital admission. Our deductive thematic analyses on the clinical narratives/notes and diagnoses highlight the connection of ACEs with cyber/bullying and other clinical diagnoses like depression, anxiety, PTSD, and ADD/ADHD. Additionally, our results point to potential impacts of the gender spectrum and other non-ACE indicators like adoption and the need for Department of Child Services (DCS). The outcome of this study provides distinct computational and clinical design guidelines for better collaborative decision making in healthcare, including the need for ACEs screening as standard-of-care within acute mental health settings. \r\n\r\nCAUTION: This paper includes graphic contents about adverse childhood traumas and events.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Because algorithm audits are conducted by technical experts, audits are necessarily limited to the hypotheses that experts think to test. End users hold the promise to expand this purview, as they inhabit spaces and witness algorithmic impacts that auditors do not. In pursuit of this goal, we propose end-user audits—system-scale audits led by non-technical users—and present an approach that scaffolds end users in hypothesis generation, evidence identification, and results communication. Today, performing a system-scale audit requires substantial user effort to label thousands of system outputs, so we introduce a collaborative filtering technique that leverages the algorithmic system's own disaggregated training data to project from a small number of end user labels onto the full test set. Our end-user auditing tool, IndieLabel, employs these projected labels so that users can rapidly explore where their opinions diverge from the algorithmic system's outputs. By highlighting topic areas where the system is under-performing for the user and surfacing sets of likely error cases, the tool guides the user in authoring an audit report. In an evaluation of end-user audits on a popular comment toxicity model with 17 non-technical participants, participants both replicated issues that formal audits had previously identified and also raised previously underreported issues such as under-flagging on veiled forms of hate that perpetuate stigma and over-flagging of slurs that have been reclaimed by marginalized communities.",

      "abstract": "The  conventional ‘participant-as-informant’ model of user research has recently been challenged by approaches that advocate for participants to have a greater authorial control over narratives that portray their lived experiences. This is particularly important for addressing relationships of power and representation. Informed by narrative approaches in social work, we report on a study exploring the use of self-authored videos captured by 16 participants from under-resourced communities. Participants portrayed their mundane life experiences in a form of a video biography. Co-analysis of resulting videos showed that video biographies were used for: authentic representation of daily routines and life stories; portrayal of DIY identities; and promoting living well. Findings show how the self-authored biographies afforded participants a vehicle for challenging cultural stereotypes often associated with the research population. We further demonstrate the value of video-based approaches in user research for illuminating mundane life through rich autobiographical narratives.",

      "abstract": "Recommender systems are playing an increasingly important role in alleviating information overload and supporting users' various needs, e.g., consumption, socialization, and entertainment. However, limited research focuses on how values should be extensively considered in industrial deployments of recommender systems, the ignorance of which can be problematic. To fill this gap, in this paper, we adopt Value Sensitive Design to comprehensively explore how practitioners and users recognize different values of current industrial recommender systems. Based on conceptual and empirical investigations, we focus on five values: recommendation quality, privacy, transparency, fairness, and trustworthiness. We further conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with 20 users and 10 practitioners to delve into their opinions about these values. Our results reveal the existence and sources of tensions between practitioners and users in terms of value interpretation, evaluation, and practice, which provide novel implications for designing more human-centric and value-sensitive recommender systems.",

      "abstract": "Information seeking is crucial for people’s self-care and wellbeing in times of public crises. Extensive research in HCI and CSCW has investigated empirical understandings as well as technical solutions to facilitate information seeking by domestic citizens of affected regions. However, limited knowledge is established to support international migrants who need to survive a crisis in their host countries. The current paper presents an interview study with two cohorts of Chinese migrants living in Japan (N=14) and the United States (N=14). Participants reflected on their information seeking experiences during the COVID pandemic. The reflection was supplemented by two weeks of self-tracking where participants maintained records of their COVID-related information seeking practice. Our data indicated that participants often took language detours, or visits to Mandarin  resources for information about the COVID outbreak in their host countries. They also made strategic use of the Mandarin information to perform selective reading, cross-checking, and contextualized interpretation of COVID-related information in Japanese or English. While such practices enhanced participants’ perceived effectiveness of COVID-related information gathering and sensemaking, they disadvantaged people through sometimes incognizant ways. Further, participants lacked the awareness or preference to review migrant-oriented information that was issued by the host country’s public authorities despite its availability. Building upon these findings, we discussed potential solutions to improve international migrants’ COVID-related information seeking in their non-native language and cultural environment. We advocated inclusive crisis infrastructures that would engage people with diverse levels of local language fluency, information literacy, and experience in leveraging public services.",

      "abstract": "Restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have limited opportunities for older people to participate in face-to-face organised social activities. Many organisations moved these activities online, but little is known about older adults’ experiences of participating in those activities. This paper reports an investigation of older adults’ experiences of participating in social activities that they used to attend in-person, but which were moved online because of strict lockdown restrictions. We conducted in-depth interviews with 40 older adults living independently (alone or with others). Findings from a reflexive thematic analysis show that online social activities were important during the pandemic for not only staying connected to other people but also helping older adults stay engaged in meaningful activities, including arts, sports, cultural, and civic events. Online activities provided older adults with opportunities to connect with like-minded people; share care, encouragement, and support; participate in civic agendas; learn knowledge and develop new skills; and experience entertainment, distraction, and mental stimulation. Our participants had diverse perceptions of the transition from in-person to online social activities. Based on the findings, we present a taxonomy of multi-layered meaningful activities for older adults’ digital social participation and highlight implications for future technology design. ",

We focus on their Tenant Power Hotline, a community outreach tool for tenants facing eviction and seeking organizing support. This research contributes to existing scholarship that examines data practices and the use of information and communication technologies in non-profit and grassroots organizations. To this existing scholarship, we share the structure of a counter-institution: an organization that strives to operate outside the non-profit industrial complex. We then interpret the work of Housing Justice League through the lens of care, identifying homebrewed databases and data fragmentations as negotiations between care and efficiency. We argue that care is enacted through the assemblage of the technical systems, and present tinkering as an alternative approach to developing data practices.",

      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects the mobility of 250,000 people per year worldwide. Physical activity (PA) in individuals with SCI is positively associated with improved mental and physical health outcomes. Mobile technologies have been developed to motivate individuals with SCI to increase PA using activity tracking and real-time feedback. We conducted semi-structured interviews and participatory design sessions with 15 manual wheelchair users with SCI and eight of their family members/friends to investigate user impressions of future technologies that might use computer-mediated, sensor-triggered communication to motivate PA. We assessed barriers to PA and how context-aware communication could help overcome them. Participants with SCI expressed that PA tracking and communication technologies must be tailored to their specific needs. Further analysis revealed that context-aware messaging could help participants with SCI connect with others to initiate timely conversations about overcoming PA barriers, and to provide encouragement to meet their PA goals. We discuss opportunities to empower  individuals with SCI with regards to PA using tailored, context-aware communication.",

      "abstract": "This study proposes Magic Brush, an AI-based application for dementia prevention targeting middle-aged individuals who may be at risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. In order to prevent dementia effectively at home, it is important to strengthen their intrinsic motivation. Promoting motivation is a critical issue in designing computerized cognitive therapy (CCT) for sustainability. Guided by self-determination theory, three main factors of intrinsic motivation were utilized as the main themes for the development: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Especially, we focused on demotivating factors of low competence which are commonly shared among the elderly and developed a magic brush function equipped with neural style transfer technology to help disconnect the link between low competence and demotivation. The user study (n=35) targeting individuals aged over 50 was conducted with both quantitative and qualitative methods. In general, users reported positive experiences with Magic Brush. The results of Structural Equation Modeling analysis showed that intrinsic motivation is an important contributor to the intention to use together with perceived usefulness. Intrinsic motivation can be promoted by AI therapist likability and perception of one's own performance. Discussion and implications are provided in relation to using AI technology to promote motivation.",

      "abstract": "A new approach to online discussion, which situates student discussions in the margins of the course content, can enhance student engagement with course materials. However, in high-enrollment classes, the large number of comments can overwhelm and intimidate students. Some become frustrated by the volume of potential online interactions and by a perceived lack of immediate relevance to their studies. Likewise, instructors are disappointed when outstanding discussions, that they deem valuable for all to see, get lost in the clutter. \r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, we propose visual spotlighting mechanisms for increasing the saliency of selected comments. We piloted and deployed multiple designs in two high-enrollment biology courses at a large public university in the United States. Interviews, surveys, and a controlled experiment show that spotlighting relevant comments in heavily annotated texts positively affects students’ engagement, measured in terms of their attention to comments, and their reported sense of validation and pride. Students also reported their preferences for certain spotlighting designs.",

      "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that YouTube's recommendation algorithm plays a role in online radicalization via surfacing extreme content. Radical Islamist groups, in particular, have been profiting from the global appeal of YouTube to disseminate hate and jihadist propaganda. In this quantitative, data-driven study, we investigate the prevalence of religiously intolerant Arabic YouTube videos, the tendency of the platform to recommend such videos, and how these recommendations are affected by demographics and watch history. Based on our deep learning classifier developed to detect hateful videos and a large-scale dataset of over 350K videos, we find that Arabic videos targeting religious minorities are particularly prevalent in search results (30%) and first-level recommendations (21%), and that 15% of overall captured recommendations point to hateful videos. Our personalized audit experiments suggest that gender and religious identity can substantially affect the extent of exposure to hateful content. Our results contribute vital insights into the phenomenon of online  radicalization and facilitate curbing online harmful content.",

      "abstract": "Workers in crowdsourcing are evolving from one-off, independent micro-workers to on-demand collaborators with a long-term orientation. They were expected to collaborate as transient teams to solve more complex, non-trivial tasks. However, collaboration as a team may not be as prevalent as possible, given the lack of support for synchronous collaboration and the \"competition, collaboration but transient\" nature of crowdsourcing. Aiming at unfolding how individuals collaborate as a transient team and how such teamwork can affect an individual's long-term success, this study investigates the individuals' collaborations on Kaggle, a crowdsourcing contest platform for data analysis. The analysis reveals a growing trend of collaborating as a transient team, which is influenced by contest designs like complexity and reward. However, compared with working independently, the surplus of teamwork in a contest varies over time. Furthermore, the teamwork experience is beneficial for individuals in the short term and long term. Our study distinguishes the team-related intellectual capital and solo-related intellectual capital, and finds a path dependency effect for the individual to work solely or collectively. These findings allow us to contribute insights into the collaborative strategies for crowd workers, contest designers, and platform operators like Kaggle.",

We discuss the opportunities and applications of \"piggyback prototyping\", building and evaluating new ideas for social computing on top of existing ones, expanding on its potential to contribute design recommendations. Drawing on about 50 papers which use the method, we critically examine the intellectual and technical benefits it provides, such as ecological validity and leveraging well-tested features, as well as research-product and ethical tensions it imposes, such as limits to customization and violation of participant privacy. We discuss considerations for future researchers deciding whether to use piggyback prototyping and point to new research agendas which can reduce the burden of implementing the method.",

Understanding the relationship between team dispersion and productivity is critical for supporting such teams. Extensive prior research has studied these relations in lab settings or using qualitative measures. This paper extends prior work by contributing an empirical case study in a real-world organization, using quantitative measures. We studied 117 new research project teams from the same discipline within an industrial research lab for 6 months. During this time, all teams shared one goal: submitting research papers to the same target conference. We analyzed these teams' dispersion-related characteristics as well as team productivity. Interestingly, we found little statistical evidence that geographic and time differences relate to team productivity. However, organizational and functional distances are predictive of the productivity of the dispersed teams we studied. We discuss the open research questions these findings revealed and their implications for future research.",

      "abstract": "Human-centered computing research has been increasingly applied to address important challenges in the health domain. Conducting research in cross-disciplinary teams can come with a lot of challenges in integrating knowledge across fields. Yet, we do not know what challenges HCI researchers encounter in building health research collaborations, and how these researchers negotiate these challenges while balancing their professional goals. We interviewed 17 early-career HCI faculty working in the United States who conducted research in collaboration with health researchers. Drawing from a Team Science framework, we share participants' lived experiences and identify major challenges that HCI researchers encounter when finding, collaborating with, and negotiating with health collaborators when building technologies. We propose ways to better support research collaboration aimed at designing technologies using human-centered computing approaches. This includes strategies to support HCI researchers at individual, institutional, research community and funding agencies levels through tools to translate disciplinary approaches. We suggest institutional policies to support HCI researchers through training, networking, and promotion.",

      "abstract": "The opacity of machine learning data is a significant threat to ethical data work and intelligible systems. Previous research has addressed this issue by proposing standardized checklists to document datasets. This paper expands that field of inquiry by proposing a shift of perspective: from documenting datasets toward documenting data production. We draw on participatory design and collaborate with data workers at two companies located in Bulgaria and Argentina, where the collection and annotation of data for machine learning are outsourced. Our investigation comprises 2.5 years of research including, 33 semi-structured interviews, five co-design workshops, the development of prototypes, and several feedback instances with participants. We identify key challenges and requirements related to the integration of documentation practices in real-world data production scenarios. Our findings comprise important design considerations and highlight the value of designing data documentation based on the needs of data workers. We argue that a view of documentation as a boundary object, i.e., an object that can be used differently across organizations and teams but holds enough immutable content to maintain integrity, can be useful when designing documentation to retrieve heterogeneous, often distributed, contexts of data production.

      "abstract": "Digital communication is often brisk and automated. From auto-completed messages to “likes,” research has shown that such lightweight interactions can affect perceptions of authenticity and closeness. On the other hand, effort in relationships can forge emotional bonds by conveying a sense of caring and is essential in building and maintaining relationships. To explore effortful communication, we designed and evaluated Auggie, an iOS app that encourages partners to create digitally handcrafted Augmented Reality (AR) experiences for each other. Auggie is centered around crafting a 3D character with photos, animated movements, drawings, and audio for someone else. We conducted a two-week-long field study with 30 participants (15 pairs), who used Auggie with their partners remotely. Our qualitative findings show that Auggie participants engaged in meaningful effort through the handcrafting process, and felt closer to their partners, although the tool may not be appropriate in all situations. We discuss design implications and future directions for systems that encourage effortful communication.",

      "abstract": "Increasing demands for fact-checking have led to a growing interest in developing systems and tools to automate the fact-checking process.  However,  such systems are limited in practice because their system design often does not take into account how fact-checking is done in the real world and ignores the insights and needs of various stakeholder groups core to the fact-checking process. This paper unpacks the fact-checking process by revealing the infrastructures---both human and technological---that support and shape fact-checking work. We interviewed 26 participants belonging to 16 fact-checking teams and organizations with representation from 4 continents. Through these interviews,  we describe the human infrastructure of fact-checking by identifying and presenting, in-depth, the roles of six primary stakeholder groups,  1) Editors, 2) External fact-checkers, 3) In-house fact-checkers, 4) Investigators and researchers, 5) Social media managers, and 6) Advocators.  Our findings highlight that the fact-checking process is a collaborative effort among various stakeholder groups and associated technological and informational infrastructures. By rendering visibility to the infrastructures, we reveal how fact-checking has evolved to include both short-term claims centric and long-term advocacy centric fact-checking. Our work also identifies key social and technical needs and challenges faced by each stakeholder group. Based on our findings, we suggest that improving the quality of fact-checking requires systematic changes in the civic,  informational, and technological contexts.",

      "abstract": "Despite the potential of online spaces for the democratic development of public discourse, concerns over aggressive and uncivil interactions in those spaces are rising. Online incivility is the term to define the features of a discussion that convey an unnecessarily disrespectful tone toward the participants or the topic. At the same time, the web is becoming increasingly multimodal and images are known to be an effective way of improving emotions. The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions suggests that positive emotions generated by positive images can impact incivility levels. Hence, with the goal to reduce online incivility, this study conducted a one factorial between-subject online experiment with three conditions (N = 105). The study compared the three conditions (with positive background image, neutral background image, and no background image) to identify an efficient way of reducing online incivility. The data gathered from surveys and participants’ online comments were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed to answer the research questions. The results showed that not only positive emotion background but also neutral emotion background may be effective in reducing online incivility. The results will pave way for designing more civil discussion platforms in online settings. ",

However, despite the evolving challenges researchers face navigating these platforms, and the high stakes of online science communication, relatively little HCI research has focused on understanding and supporting online science communication through these participatory platforms. Through a review of the literature and a set of interviews with HCI researchers (n = 24), we identify challenges currently facing researchers who try to engage with the public about their work, and establish a research agenda for HCI to study, design, and evaluate technology to support science communication. Specifically, we advocate for the design of tools to support audience analytics, automated summary and outreach workflows, and providing quantitative and qualitative feedback about online outreach efforts, as well as additional research to elucidate the impacts of self-directed science communication efforts and the evolving roles of scientists on the participatory web. With shifting online platforms placing researchers in the role of advocates and participants in science communication, understanding and supporting these interactions is now more important than ever.

However, prior research suggests that Q&As may not be appealing to and inclusive of both men and women, with absent social considerations listed as a potential contributing factor. We investigate how additional community presence information can affect users’ perceptions of and engagement with a Q&A for graphic design software. Through a 10-day task-based field study with 30 participants (14 women, 14 men, 2 non-binary), we uncover how community presence information can humanize the Q&A and play a role in promoting an inclusive environment. On the other hand, some participants question if community presence information belongs on a Q&A and describe some privacy implications. The women in our sample also talked about the importance of diverse community demographics, while we did not observe this sentiment expressed by the men. Our findings contribute an understanding of how users perceive the role of community presence information within a Q&A. We also discuss how this information might impact women’s future participation and engagement.",

      "abstract": "AI-based smart urban sensing (ASUS) has emerged as a scalable and pervasive application paradigm in smart city planning and management that aims to automatically assess the physical status of the urban environments by leveraging AI techniques and massive urban sensing data. In this paper, we focus on a crowd-driven neural network (NN) hyperparameter optimization problem in ASUS applications. Our goal is to utilize the human intelligence from crowdsourcing systems to identify the optimal NN hyperparameter configuration for an ASUS model. Our work is motivated by the observation that the hyperparameters of current ASUS models are often manually configured by the AI specialists, which is known to be both error-prone and suboptimal. Two key technical challenges exist in solving our problem: i) it is challenging to effectively translate the highly complex NN hyperparameter optimization problem in AI to a simplified problem that can be solved by crowd workers without extensive AI expertise; ii) it is difficult to identify the optimal hyperparameter configuration in the large hyperparameter search space given the blackbox nature of the AI model. To address the above challenges, we develop CrowdOptim, a crowd-AI collaborative learning framework that integrates the techniques from crowdsourcing, hyperparameter optimization, and estimation theory to address the crowd-driven NN hyperparameter optimization problem in ASUS applications. The evaluation results from two real-world ASUS applications (i.e., smart city infrastructure monitoring (SCIM) and urban environment cleanliness assessment (UECA)) show that CrowdOptim consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art deep convolutional networks, crowd-AI, and hyperparameter optimization baselines in achieving the ASUS application objectives under various evaluation scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Misinformation runs rampant on social media and has been tied to adverse health behaviors such as vaccine hesitancy. Crowdsourcing can be a means to detect and impede the spread of misinformation online. However, past studies have not deeply examined the individual characteristics— such as cognitive factors and biases— that predict crowdworker accuracy at identifying misinformation. In our study (n = 265), MTurk workers and university students assessed the truthfulness and sentiment of COVID-19 related tweets as well as answered several surveys on personal characteristics. Results support the viability of crowdsourcing for assessing misinformation and content stance (i.e., sentiment) related to ongoing and politically-charged topics like the COVID-19 pandemic, however, alignment with experts depends on who is in the crowd. Specifically, we find that respondents with high Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) scores, conscientiousness, and trust in medical scientists are more aligned with experts while respondents with high Need for Cognitive Closure (NFCC) and those who lean politically conservative are less aligned with experts. We see differences between recruitment platforms as well, as our data shows university students are on average more aligned with experts than MTurk workers, most likely due to overall differences in participant characteristics on each platform. Results offer transparency into how crowd composition affects misinformation and stance assessment and have implications on future crowd recruitment and filtering practices.",

      "abstract": "Digital designers often do not make their work accessible (e.g., websites failing criteria set by the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), and accessible design research discusses many solutions to address this problem (e.g., teaching accessibility within university design and technical courses). However, prior research in this area typically does not acknowledge whether recommendations and resources to support accessible design are suitable for all digital designers due to different training pathways and job support structures (e.g., large-company vs. rural and self-employed designers or designers who learned their skills outside of formal education settings). We interviewed 20 digital designers from rural and urban areas, as well as working from home and remotely, to understand the challenges they experience in making accessible content within the context of their workplace. We find that job support structures mediate the effectiveness of current accessible design recommendations and resources, and we suggest how to improve accessible design support to meet the needs of under-resourced designers.",

      "abstract": "In a remote collaboration involving a physical task, visualising gaze behaviours may compensate for other unavailable communication channels. In this paper, we report on a 360° panoramic Mixed Reality (MR) remote collaboration system that shares gaze behaviour visualisations between a local user in Augmented Reality and a remote collaborator in Virtual Reality. We conducted two user studies to evaluate the design of MR gaze interfaces and the effect of gaze behaviour (on/off) and gaze style (bi-/uni-directional). The results indicate that gaze visualisations amplify meaningful joint attention and improve co-presence compared to a no gaze condition. Gaze behaviour visualisations enable communication to be less verbally complex therefore lowering collaborators’ cognitive load while improving mutual understanding. Users felt that bi-directional behaviour visualisation, showing both collaborator’s gaze state, was the preferred condition since it enabled easy identification of shared interests and task progress.",

Increasingly, these technologies are released as continually evolving platforms and services, so their development involves ongoing discussions and debates about unforeseen problems and future directions. However, there is a gap in research about how designers, developers, and other stakeholders engage with values during later stages of development. We investigate discussions about values in the context of open source software development, focusing on projects related to the Decentralized Web. We conducted a large-scale analysis of GitHub issues among diverse yet ideologically-related projects. We show that the percentage of discussions about values increases later in development, and we identify features and outcomes of conflicts related to open source participants' values. Finally, we propose suggestions to improve upon existing discussion practices by supporting common ground among collaborators with diverse goals, perspectives, and experiences.",

However, normal employees may prefer messages more relevant to their jobs or interests. Organizations face the challenge of balancing prioritizing the messages they prefer employees to know (tactical goals) while maintaining employees' positive experiences with these bulk emails, then they continue to read these emails in the future (strategic goals).\r\n\r\nCould personalization help organizations achieve these tactical and strategic goals? In an 8-week field experiment with a university newsletter, we implemented a 4x5x5 factorial design on personalizing subject lines, top news, and message order based on both the employees' and the organization's preferences. We measured these designs' influences on the open/interest/recognition/read-in-detail rate of the whole newsletter and the single messages within it.\r\n\r\nWe found that ``important-to-organization'' messages only got higher recognition rates when being put on subject lines / top news (tactical goal). Mixing them with employee-preferred messages in top news did not bring further improvement to their own recognition rates but could improve the whole newsletter's recognition rate. Only when the top news solely contained the employee-preferred messages were the employees slightly more interested in the newsletter (strategic goal). We further analyze on which topics the employees and the organization's preferences conflicted. Finally, we discuss the design suggestions for organizational bulk email.",

Prior work has established that privacy on networked publics, such as social media, is complex, requiring users to navigate not only the technical affordances on the platform but also interpersonal relationships and social norms. We investigate how teenagers think about privacy on the popular image-sharing platform, Instagram. We draw on an online survey (N=144) and semi-structured interviews (N=21) with teenagers, ages 13-19, to gain a better understanding how teenagers configure privacy on the popular image-sharing platform Instagram and why they make these privacy decisions. Finally, based on our findings, we provide design recommendations towards the design of better privacy controls for promoting teenage safety online. ",

      "abstract": "Mutual awareness of visual attention is essential for collaborative work. In the field of collaborative virtual environments (CVE), it has been proposed to use Field-of-View (FoV) frustum visualisations as a cue to support mutual awareness during collaboration. Recent studies on FoV frustum visualisations focus on asymmetric collaboration with AR/VR hardware setups and 3D reconstructed environments. In contrast, we focus on the general-purpose CVEs (i.e., VR shared offices), whose popularity is increasing due to the availability of low-cost headsets, and the restrictions imposed by the pandemic. In these CVEs collaboration roles are symmetrical, and the same 2D content available on desktop computers is displayed on 2D surfaces in a 3D space (VR screens). We prototyped one such CVE to evaluate FoV frustrum visualisation within this collaboration scenario. We also implement a FoV visualisation generated from an average fixation map (AFM), therefore directly generated by users' gaze behaviour which we call Cone of Vision (CoV). Our approach to displaying the frustum visualisations is tailored for 2D surfaces in 3D space and allows for self-awareness of this visual cue. We evaluate CoV in the context of a general exploratory data analysis (EDA) with 10 pairs of participants. Our findings indicate that CoV is beneficial during shifts between independent and collaborative work and supports collaborative progression across the visualisation. Self-perception of the CoV improves visual attention coupling, reduces the number of times users watch the collaborator's avatars and offers a consistent representation of the shared reality.",

      "abstract": "The design of online platforms is both critically important and challenging. Any changes to large complex socio-technical systems may lead to unintended consequences, and it can be hard to predict how users will react. Here we conduct a case study of a particularly important real-world platform design change: Twitter's decision to change their signature feature by doubling the character limit from 140 to 280 characters to soothe users' need to ''cram'' or ''squeeze'' their tweets. The platform change had been informed by Twitter's modeling of historical user behavior, estimating that with a 280-character limit, over 99% of English tweets would require no cramming.\r\n\r\nIn our analysis, we contrast Twitter's anticipated pre-intervention predictions about user behavior with actual post-intervention user behavior: Did the platform design change lead to the intended user behavior shifts, or did a gap between anticipated and actual behavior emerge? Did different user groups react differently? We find that even though users do not \"cram\" as much under 280 characters as they used to under 140 characters, emergent \"cramming\" at the new limit seems to not have been taken into account when designing the platform change. Furthermore, investigating textual features, we find that, although post-intervention \"crammed\" tweets are longer, their syntactic and semantic characteristics remain similar and indicative of \"squeezing\". Applying the same approach as Twitter policy-makers, we create updated counterfactual estimates and find that the character limit would need to be increased further to reduce cramming that re-emerged at the new limit.\r\n\r\nWe contribute to the rich literature studying online user behavior with an empirical study that reveals a dynamic interaction between platform design and user behavior, with immediate policy and practical implications for the design of socio-hyp technical systems. Our results highlight the need to carefully consider multiple factors when designing a platform change, including the dynamic nature of user response and the impact the change will have on different populations depending on users' languages and devices.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) depends on data to train and verify models. Very often, organizations outsource processes related to data work (i.e., generating and annotating data and evaluating outputs) through business process outsourcing (BPO) companies and crowdsourcing platforms. This paper investigates outsourced ML data work in Latin America by studying three platforms in Venezuela and a BPO in Argentina. We lean on the Foucauldian notion of dispositif to define the data-production dispositif as an ensemble of discourses, actions, and objects strategically disposed to (re)produce power/knowledge relations. Our dispositif analysis comprises the examination of 210 data work instruction documents, 55 interviews with data workers, managers, and requesters, and participant observation. Our findings show that discourses encoded in instructions reproduce and normalize the worldviews of requesters. Precarious working conditions and economic dependency alienate workers, making them obedient to instructions. Furthermore, discourses and social contexts materialize in artifacts, such as interfaces and performance metrics, limiting workers’ agency and normalizing specific ways of interpreting data. We conclude by stressing the importance of counteracting the data-production dispositif by fighting alienation and precarization, and empowering data workers to become assets in the quest for high-quality data.",

      "abstract": "Design has traditionally been used to solve problems in the field of Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D). Mobile phone applications intended to address health and education challenges in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are prominent examples of these efforts. In this paper, I argue that design—especially, speculative approaches—can play a different role in HCI4D. Within HCI, speculative design has proven to be useful for raising critical questions. Here, I present a collection of nine speculative design concepts that are intended to raise questions about mobile phones; in particular, how they are designed and what they are used for. These concepts are inspired by my 10+ years of studying mobile phone use in Kenya. In the discussion, I elaborate on how speculative design approaches can benefit HCI4D by prompting questions about whether the field is solving the right problems. I also discuss how speculative design is useful for drawing attention to other problems and topics of study. ",

We propose StressTrendmeter, a mobile application that targets college students for anonymously sharing the source of stress via the form of hashtags, viewing stress topics based on trends, and providing social support through the empathy button and hashtag-based chat. We deployed StressTrendmeter to 222 students from two universities for five weeks. With hashtags and trending features, students found StressTrendmeter (i) helpful to spontaneously yet concisely articulate their stress topics and (ii) easy to browse through and become aware of issues around the campus.\r\nOur study reveals that social sharing with StressTrendmeter brought awareness, resonance, and accountability as students empathized and expressed support. Based on our study, we share design implications for social support systems with community awareness.",

      "abstract": "Small and Medium sized Businesses (SMBs) make up majority of employment in Africa (around 80%). Understanding the digital transformation that SMBs in Africa went through during the pandemic can play an important role in uncovering how to build solutions that better support the African business and African worker. In this paper we report on findings from a qualitative study with 40 SMBs in Kenya. The study aimed to understand the lived experience of digital transformation, the impacts of COVID-19 on their businesses, and how they responded to such impacts using technology. We found that COVID-prompted digital transformation was reactive and opportunistic, plus social and collective. Moreover, the socialness of business goes way beyond digital transformation, and influences how SMBs in Kenya start, develop and are sustained. In illustrating this, we offer a lens to understanding work and workers of SMBs in Kenya and similar contexts across the globe.",

      "abstract": "Contact tracing, a major way to curb COVID-19, has been employed worldwide, with human interviewing and proximity tracing technology as two major approaches. While previous research has contributed some understanding of people's perspectives on contact tracing technology, much of this is based in single countries or regions where technology has been deployed. To understand how culture influences people's perceptions toward human tracing and digital tracing, we replicated a mixed-methods survey study conducted in the U.S. in South Korea and compared participants' perspectives. South Korean participants preferred digital tracing to human tracing, contrasting with the U.S. context where no strong preference was observed. We discuss how observed differences in perspective align and contrast with the country's typical cultural dimensions, such as high power distance, informing the perspective that human tracing will have greater accuracy. We emphasize the need for culturally designing contact tracing technology to highlight personal benefits regardless of cultural dimensions, and leverage technology to support social interaction in human tracing.

We conducted a user study to explore the user experience under one decentralized and two centralized control conditions via using the proposed two-player asymmetric collaborative bodily play, LAGH, which supports perspective-taking through the integration with the first- and second-perspectives and shared objects. The two players have complementary views and controls to each other in an immersive environment. The results indicate that participant pairs were encouraged by the asymmetric collaboration interface to share their emotional and physiological perspectives with each other. When their control abilities were balanced, they were more motivated to perform information sharing and interact with each other, thereby enhancing closeness and stimulating empathy. Furthermore, users could improve the collaboration efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Given that measuring food consumption at a population scale is a challenging task, researchers have begun to explore digital traces (e.g., from social media or from food-tracking applications) as potential proxies. The validity of such methods has, however, not been established; it remains unclear to what extent digital traces reflect real food consumption. The present study aims to bridge this gap by quantifying the link between dietary behaviors as captured via social media and via food-tracking applications, at a population scale. We focus on the case of Switzerland and contrast images of consumed foods collected through a food tracking app with food images shared on Twitter, by designing and deploying a novel crowdsourcing framework for estimating biases with respect to nutritional properties and appearance.\r\n\r\nWe find that the food type distributions in social media vs. food tracking diverge; e.g., bread is 2.5 times more frequent among consumed and tracked foods than on Twitter, whereas cake is 12 times more frequent on Twitter. Controlling for the different food type distributions, we contrast consumed and tracked foods of a given type with foods shared on Twitter. For instance, with respect to tastiness, on average across food types, the median dish posted on Twitter ranks among the top 26% of actually consumed and tracked dishes. Across food types, food posted on Twitter is perceived as tastier, more caloric, less healthy, less likely to have been consumed at home, more complex, and larger-portioned, compared to consumed and tracked foods.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there is a divergence between food consumption as measured via the two platforms implies that at least one of the two is not a faithful representation of the true food consumption in the general Swiss population. Thus, researchers should be attentive and aim to establish evidence of validity before using digital traces as a proxy for the true food consumption in the general population. We conclude by discussing the potential sources of these biases and their implications, outlining pitfalls and threats to validity, and proposing actionable ways for overcoming them. ",

      "abstract": "Sharing personal informatics data can support accountability, connectedness, and self-expression, but people often find their data too trivial to share on social media. Ephemeral social platforms like Snapchat and Story features have emerged as spaces for sharing more trivial life events, presenting an opportunity to incorporate self-tracked data into sharing. Past work suggests that including data-driven stickers on these platforms can help add additional context to what people share, but little is known about the benefits and challenges of people's everyday experiences with this concept. To understand people's everyday use of data-driven stickers, we designed and developed SnapPI, an app for flexibly incorporating data into stickers for Snapchat. We deployed SnapPI to 21 participants for two weeks, finding that participants value aligning data sharing with Snapchat's communication and stylistic norms. Perceiving Snapchat as a playful platform, participants creatively aligned data stickers with various visual components of their Snaps. Stickers were used to incorporate personal informatics data into their existing conversations, and were edited to align with different audience needs or to be expressive. We discuss recommendations for personal data sharing, suggesting supporting flexibility in presentation and aligning with the norms of existing platforms.",

      "abstract": "Misinformation on social media has become a serious concern. Marking news stories with credibility indicators, possibly generated by an AI model, is one way to help people combat misinformation. In this paper, we report the results of two randomized experiments that aim to understand the effects of AI-based credibility indicators on people's perceptions of and engagement with the news, when people are under {\\em social influence} such that their judgement of the news is influenced by other people. We find that the presence of AI-based credibility indicators nudges people into aligning their belief in the veracity of news with the AI model’s prediction regardless of its correctness, thereby changing people's accuracy in detecting misinformation. However, AI-based credibility indicators show limited impacts on influencing people's engagement with either real news or fake news when social influence exists. Finally, it is shown that when social influence is present, the effects of AI-based credibility indicators on the detection and spread of misinformation are larger as compared to when social influence is absent, when these indicators are provided to people before they form their own judgements about the news. We conclude by providing implications for better utilizing AI to fight misinformation.",

      "abstract": "The right of access, found in the EU’s GDPR and similar data protection regulations around the world, requires corporations and other organizations to give people access to the data they hold about them. Such regulations create obligations for data controllers but leave flexibility on how to achieve them, resulting in variation in how Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs) are implemented by different corporations. To understand the various practices emerging around DSARs and how requesting data influences the way people think of data protection laws, we asked participants in India, the UK and USA to make 38 DSARs from 11 different companies. Using the metaphor of the policy-design-practice “knot”, we examine DSARs as a case of the co-constitutive links between policy, design, and practice. We find that the DSAR process was not linear and participants employed many work-arounds. The challenges they encountered in the overall DSAR process negatively affected their perceptions of data protection policies. Our study suggests that researchers have to be flexible in adapting research methodology to understanding emerging practices, and that there is a need for more collaborative experimentation with DSARs before standardizing the process.",

      "abstract": "Mobile service robots have become increasingly ubiquitous. However, these robots can pose potential accessibility issues and safety concerns to people with visual impairments (PVI). We sought to explore the challenges faced by PVI around mainstream mobile service robots and identify their needs. Seventeen PVI were interviewed about their experiences with three emerging robots: vacuum robots, delivery robots, and drones. We comprehensively investigated PVI's robot experiences by considering their different roles around robots---direct users and bystanders. Our study highlighted participants' challenges and concerns on accessibility, safety, and privacy issues around mobile service robots. We found that the lack of accessible feedback made it difficult for PVI to precisely control, locate, and track the status of the robots. Moreover, encountering mobile robots as bystanders confused and even scared the participants, presenting safety and privacy barriers. We further distilled design considerations for more accessible and safe robots for PVI.",

      "abstract": "Visualization dashboards serve as an information presentation that uses a tiled layout of key metrics visualized in charts for collaborative decision-making. Existing work has developed tools and techniques for computational color design. Much of these efforts have focused on selecting effective color palettes for independent charts while few attempts have been made to support the expressive color design of multiple coordinated charts in dashboards. In this work, we describe ColorCook, an interactive system that helps design expressive and effective dashboard colorings using domain-associated palettes. ColorCook employs an integrated color workflow for dashboarding, consisting of palette selection, color assignment, and color adjustment. We evaluated ColorCook through a crowdsourcing experiment and a user study. The results of our evaluation indicated that ColorCook is useful for effective and expressive color design.",

This concept enables us to identify struggles of collective use of computational devices today, delimiting collective artifact ecologies in order to study and explain how they develop and overlap. Through an analysis of three empirical cases, we illustrate the notion of collectives and how they face challenges in establishing, maintaining and negotiating their artifact ecologies. This paper, therefore, contributes a theoretical foundation for analyzing groups and communities as collectives, with a particular emphasis on the multiple tools and artifacts they use. To serve as a starting point for further engagement with these concepts, we have provided a number of guiding questions to support the understanding of collective artifact ecologies. ",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the tools and practices used by Orientation and Mobility (O&M) specialists in instructing people who are blind or have low vision in concepts, skills, and techniques for safe and independent travel. Based on interviews with experienced instructors who practice in different O&M settings we find that a shortage of qualified specialists and restrictions on in-person activities during COVID-19 has accelerated interest in remote instruction and assessment, while widespread adoption of smartphones with accessibility support has driven interest in assistive apps. This presents both opportunities and challenges for a practice that is traditionally conducted in-person and assessed through qualitative observations. In response we identify multiple opportunities for HCI research in service of O&M, including: supporting a 'physician's assistant' model of remote O&M instruction and assessment, matching  O&M instructors' clients with guide dogs, highlighting clients' progress towards O&M goals, and collaboratively planning routes and monitoring clients' independent travel progress.",

      "abstract": "Past CSCW work has examined the role of temporal rhythms in cooperative work and has identified alignment work--the work required to bring dissonant rhythms into alignment--as an important aspect of large-scale collaboration. We ask instead how individual workers interact with temporal rhythms to sustain the conditions that make their work possible--not aligning rhythms, but attuning them. This paper draws on interviews with farmer-knowledge workers, people who engage with both farm work (the work of growing food or raising animals for food, on a commercial or non-commercial basis) and computer-based knowledge work. We identify three ways that farmer-knowledge workers interact with natural and structural rhythms to construct sustainable work-lives: anchoring (tying oneself to a particular rhythm to create accountability and structure), decoupling (loosening or cutting ties with a rhythm to create flexibility), and gap-filling (interweaving complementary rhythms to create balance). Together, these practices constitute attunement work.",

      "abstract": "Platform operators have devoted significant effort to combating misinformation on behalf of their users. Users are also stakeholders in this battle, but their efforts to combat misinformation go unsupported by the platforms. In this work, we consider three new user affordances that give social media users greater power in their fight against misinformation: (1) the ability to provide structured accuracy assessments of posts, (2) user-specified indication of trust in other users, and (3) and user configuration of social feed filters according to assessed accuracy. \r\nTo understand the potential of these designs, we conducted a need-finding survey of 192 people who share and discuss news on social media, finding that many already act to limit or combat misinformation, albeit by repurposing existing platform affordances that lack customized structure for information assessment. We then conducted a field study of a prototype social media platform that implements these user affordances as structured inputs to directly impact how and whether posts are shown. The study involved 14 participants who used the platform for a week to share news while collectively assessing their accuracy. We report on users' perception and use of these affordances. We also provide design implications for platforms and researchers based on our empirical observations.",

      "abstract": "In China, lesbian and bisexual women face intense stigma and difficulties developing relationships with each other. Although prior research has shown that online communities help LGBT people connect and exchange social support, few studies have explored the challenges Chinese lesbian and bisexual women face when initiating, growing, and sustaining such communities, in an atmosphere of platform censorship of LGBT-related content and intense discrimination from non-LGBT people. To address this gap, we interviewed 40 Weibo users in China, four bloggers and 36 followers of their blogs, who self-identified as lesbian or bisexual women. We found that a key technique these bloggers used to initiate their online communities was helping followers publish posts seeking support, sharing personal experiences, and seeking offline relationships. Then, their followers built relationships with bloggers by journaling their daily experiences as lesbian or bisexual women via private-messaging channels. As the communities’ members grew more attached to them, bloggers and their followers began to work together to protect themselves from external threats, including Weibo’s censorship and non-LGBT+ infiltrators’ harassment. However, such attachment to the communities sometimes might lead to conflicts within them, which in turn prompted many members to leave, raising questions about the communities’ long-term prospects. Our findings foreground important design considerations for those seeking to help lesbian and bisexual women in China and other discriminatory environments to develop safe online communities.",

      "abstract": "The shift to virtual has changed our society and left an impact on nearly every part of our lives. Although it brought many challenges, global remote access also opened up a world of educational and professional opportunities for many people who did not have them before. In this work, we detail the findings of a study collecting feedback on inclusivity in virtual, in-person, and hybrid spaces, with the goal of building a greater understanding of the issues and personal challenges faced by access and equity stakeholders. From a survey of 104 individuals and detailed interviews with 12, we have used a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods to discover key challenges. The diversity of experiences and opinions was striking, with many winners and losers going into the virtual space. We propose some modifications to the online environment and in-person practices with the aim of furthering equality.",

      "abstract": "Individuals’ social class background shapes their life experiences and outcomes, including their familial upbringing and educational attainment. However, we know little about how social class background influences the hiring practices of professional settings, and specifically, the ways in which evaluators conceptualize a potential link between social class background and hiring. Through interviewing 50 evaluators at large technology companies, we find that only 19 of them discussed how social class background affects applicants’ access to resources, and none articulated the ties between social class background and preferred interpersonal interactional styles. This is particularly troubling because all evaluators described assessing the key hiring criteria of “innovation potential” based on whether applicants display what we term a “transboundary interactional style.” This style involves demonstrating an ease with articulating cross-disciplinary ideas as well as facilitating back-and-forth scholarly conversations and debates. While evaluators characterized this style as stemming from applicants’ individual personalities, we draw on past sociological literature to suggest that this style is also cultivated in upper-middle-class environments. Given technology companies’ expressed desire to hire a diverse workforce by minimizing biases in evaluators’ assessments, we conclude with ideas for evaluators to develop more equitable hiring practices.",

      "abstract": "The use of integrative medicine (IM) practices during pregnancy is on the rise in the United States and a growing number of individuals seek pregnancy support outside of the conventional medical system every year. There is a variety of integrative medicine providers (IMPs) who work outside the clinical system to fill the gaps in pregnancy support by providing a set of services such as midwifery, doula care, childbirth education, and lactation support. Evidence suggests integrative medicine providers positively impact pregnancy experiences, yet IMPs are often marginalized and excluded from the conventional pregnancy healthcare system. We present results from an ongoing investigation that seeks to understand the roles IMPs play in pregnancy healthcare journeys and the pregnancy ecology. We interviewed 12 integrative medicine providers to understand their needs and challenges concerning technology, business models, and communication practices. Our findings reflect on a broad range of topics including the intersection of personal and professional journeys, legitimacy within the healthcare system, and the provision of personalized care. We discuss the potential for technology to support IMPs and present implications for the design of future pregnancy support technologies. Improving collaborative care and communication technologies for the IM community has the potential to improve professional experiences and the quality of care provided by IMPs. WARNING: This paper includes detailed personal narratives of individuals’ pregnancy healthcare journey including information about, pregnancy, labor, delivery, birth stories, and pregnancy loss.",

      "abstract": "When tech initiatives end, the artifacts they leave behind continue to impact stakeholders they originally purport to help and communities they have not anticipated affecting. Following an orientation toward broken world thinking, our study introduces the concept of documental afterlives to refer to the range of fates to which these digital artifacts have fallen. In this paper, we systematically review the 118 websites listed in a publicly available database of refugee tech initiatives in Germany as they appear today. We identify that documental afterlives of these projects fall into categories of being broken, unattended, and memorialized. Given the value and impact of these artifacts, we argue that an ethical response to these afterlives requires that we attend to them through stewardship, centering the notion of care and drawing from archival practices. On an empirical level, this paper contributes an updated understanding of how the traces of our initiatives appear long after many of them have ended. Conceptually, our notion of documental afterlives calls on us to attend to the artifacts that we leave behind, recognizing their continued entanglement in social relationships. ",

      "abstract": "The Emergency Department (ED) is a stressful, safety-critical environment, which is overcrowded, noisy, chaotic, and understaffed.  The built environment plays a key role in patient outcomes, experiences, and the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs). \r\n However, once a space is built it is difficult to change it; so the modularity and adaptability of new technologies such as robots could potentially help stakeholders mitigate some of these challenges; yet, there is a lack of research in this area, particularly in the ED.  In this paper, we address this gap by engaging HCWs in a research-through-design process, utilizing design fiction, to envision a future resilient ED.  Here, robots scurry along the ceiling, provide help at the bedside, and smart furniture and walls provide spaces for privacy and calm.  We co-created design prototypes of future intelligent systems that can modify the built environment to support resilience, which we then used to co-create a Design Catalog with HCWs, which contains a collection of future technology prototypes contextualized within the ED.  We found that HCWs envisioned many ways for intelligent systems to help them reimagine the built environment, including ways to enhance HCW-patient communication, improve patient experience, support both HCW and patient safety, and use reconfigurable spaces to support privacy.  We hope our work inspires further exploration into using new technologies to reimagine and reconfigure the built environment to support resilient hospitals. ",

      "abstract": "Social media users often suffer from the problem of content over-disclosure. Most existing studies attempt to solve this problem by recommending proper audiences for users when sharing content. However, the audience management strategy cannot filter out sensitive information from the post and narrow the scope of content permeation. On the contrary, this paper conducts research from the content perspective and aims to design a content censorship model to help users evaluate the publicity of a post and find the sensitive information from it. The user can revise the content accordingly to achieve goals of sensitive information protection and broader content permeation. For this intention, we first built a dataset to explore the factors related to the public level of a post and the sensitive information. Based on the findings, a novel personalized multi-task content censorship model was built using several state-of-the-art deep learning techniques such as Seq2Seq and Co-training. We also implemented a prototype, i.e. a Browser plugin-based content censorship tool, by utilizing Weibo as a research site. Our model and its prototype were evaluated through automatic and human evaluations. The automatic evaluation suggests that our model outperforms the baseline methods on several metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score. The human evaluation also reveals that our model and prototype play an important role in helping users identify sensitive information. Based on these results, we proposed several insights for the future design of the social media content censorship system.",

This paper explores and attempts to quantify the uncertainties and biases due to \\textit{annotator} demographics when creating sentiment analysis datasets. We ask $>$1000 crowdworkers to provide their demographic information and annotations for multimodal sentiment data and its component modalities. We show that demographic differences among annotators impute a significant effect on their ratings, and that these effects also occur in each component modality. We compare predictions of different state-of-the-art multimodal machine learning algorithms against annotations provided by different demographic groups, and find that changing annotator demographics can cause $>$4.5\\% in accuracy difference when determining positive versus negative sentiment. Our findings underscore the importance of accounting for crowdworker attributes, such as demographics, when building datasets, evaluating algorithms, and interpreting results for sentiment analysis.",

      "abstract": "Older adults' technology learning is a long-term process, during which family members often play significant roles. Although much research has emphasized how family support is important, little research has dove into the evolution of family dynamics when older adults are learning to use new technology. Drawing on the results from a qualitative study that performed semi-structured interviews with 20 older adults and 18 younger adults in China, we unpack how family members were involved in technology learning over time. Our findings suggest that younger family members play transformative roles throughout older adults' learning stages, i.e., as influencers, supporters, protectors, and monitors. Younger family members' roles co-evolve with not only older adults' changing needs but also their perceptions of older adults' learning abilities and online behaviors. They may struggle to adjust their teaching strategies to accommodate older adults' needs and abilities during the process. They may also worry about older adults' online benefits and safety as many older adults become far more active online than anticipated. Challenges while teaching and tensions regarding protection may thus emerge during the support process. With these findings, we suggest that older adults' technology learning should be treated as a collaborative activity with family members rather than an activity they pursue alone. We also highlight older adults' technology learning as a recurrent, dynamic, and evolving process, and call attention to the unique culture of \"xiaoshun\" in China that acts as a buffer to the burdens and tensions found with family support.

      "abstract": "Responsive architecture envisions the built environment to adapt to the changing needs of its occupants dynamically. Although it is increasingly feasible to move space-defining objects like room dividers by mobile robots, little is known about how or when such spatial adaptations should occur. We therefore measured the experience of 26 occupants while they performed six different activities inside an office breakout room that was being adapted by a robotically moving wall in either a reactive or proactive way. Based on these empirical findings, we propose how autonomous spatial adaptation should primarily aim to balance the spatial, situational and subjective qualities of the resulting sense of place. We also define eight distinct design recommendations that exploit the unique affordances of spatial adaptation. By asserting that future advances in human-building interaction (HBI) should be based on creating appropriate places rather than controlling functional spaces, we foresee how responsive architecture might become as compelling as its static counterpart.",

To investigate if and how a user-centered conversational evaluation tool impacts users' response quality and their experience, we build EVA - a novel conversational course evaluation tool for educational scenarios. In a field-experimental study with 128 students, we compared EVA against a static web survey. Our results confirm prior findings from literature about the positive effect of conversational evaluation tools in the domain of education. Second, we then investigate the differences between a voice-based and text-based conversational human-computer interaction of EVA in the same experimental set-up. Against our prior expectation, the students of the voice-based interaction answered with higher information quality but with lower quantity of information compared to the text-based modality. Our findings indicate that using a conversational CA (voice and text-based) results in a higher response quality and user experience compared to a static web survey interface. ",

      "abstract": "Learning macronutrient assessment skills can support improved health outcomes and overall wellbeing. We conducted two Mechanical Turk studies to investigate how users might benefit from the crowd's input in macronutrient assessment education. We first determined whether the wisdom of the crowd alone would provide users with enough insight to arrive at accurate macronutrient estimates. Next, we tested two methods of teaching macronutrient assessment skills (Comparison and Decomposition) and analyzed their effectiveness. Results from these studies indicate that while the crowd alone may not be sufficient to support this type of education, users may yet benefit from access to community-generated photos and labels while they use either the Comparison or Decomposition strategy.",

      "abstract": "Recent research has explored computational tools to manage workplace stress via personal sensing, a measurement paradigm in which behavioral data streams are collected from technologies including smartphones, wearables, and personal computers. As these tools develop, they invite inquiry into how they can be appropriately implemented towards improving workers’ well-being. In this study, we explored this proposition through formative interviews followed by a design provocation centered around measuring burnout in a U.S. resident physician program. Residents and their supervising attending physicians were presented with medium-fidelity mockups of a dashboard providing behavioral data on residents’ sleep, activity and time working; self-reported data on residents’ levels of burnout; and a free text box where residents could further contextualize their well-being. Our findings uncover tensions around how best to measure workplace well-being, who within a workplace is accountable for worker stress, and how the introduction of such tools remakes the boundaries of appropriate information flows between worker and workplace. We conclude by charting future work confronting these tensions, to ensure personal sensing is leveraged to truly improve worker well-being.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the practice of platform-based food delivery as a meal well served for scholars within CSCW based on a review of extant literature on the practice. CSCW holds a valuable set of notions and tools for future granular inquiry into the work practice on food delivery platforms and pertinent questions from the field of food delivery resonate with research agendas within CSCW. This argument is based on a scoping synthetic literature review that identifies characteristics of food delivery work and connects them to previous scholarship within CSCW. With few exceptions, food delivery workers are typically young, male and of immigrant background. The work practice typically relies on algorithmic management, dynamic scheduling, a form piece-rate remuneration, and while food delivery workers work solitarily, workers repeatedly organize in both formal and informal groups. Finally, the review shows that while these characteristics are common, there is a high degree of engagement with the local environment which significantly impacts the work practice between the platforms and between locations. The discussion brings forth salient issues and outlines two alleys of future work.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction has become one of the most severe worldwide social problems. Recent research has examined utilizing social media to support addiction recovery and the problematic use of social media for selling drugs and glamorizing drug use. Prior studies have focused on textual and networking-based social media such as Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit, but there is limited understanding of how video-based platforms like YouTube allow creators to share drug addiction-related videos and discourse about addiction problems. This work performs a content analysis of 387 drug-addiction-related videos collected from YouTube. The grounded-theory approach based on the health-emergency framework identifies how drug-addiction videos discourse the addiction-related risk, blame, urgency, praise, and solution. Video viewership and comments are also compared between the emerged video themes. Results suggest YouTubers educate others about drug addiction, disclose personal experiences, and advocate for addiction prevention and recovery. Based on our findings, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of using video-sharing to prevent and educate drug addiction. ",

      "abstract": "With the rising popularity of photo sharing in online social media, interpersonal privacy violations, where one person violates the privacy of another, have become an increasing concern. Although applying image obfuscations has been a useful tool for improving privacy when sharing photos, prior studies have found these obfuscation techniques adversely affect viewers’ satisfaction. In the context of ephemeral (or disappearing) photos, which have been popularized by apps such as Snapchat, people have found workarounds to save these photos before deletion. We conducted an online experiment (N=385) to evaluate people’s sharing preferences with two proposed temporal redactions in different contexts (by varying the photo content and the type of recipient). We also studied people’s sharing behaviors under different levels of assurance provided by the viewer’s platform (i.e., whether the receiver’s platform is secured using trusted hardware). Our findings suggest that although people are comfortable with existing methods, the proposed temporal redaction mechanisms are often preferred. We also found no difference in participants’ sharing behaviors for trusted and non-trusted viewing platforms, suggesting more efforts are needed to convey the benefits of trusted hardware to users.",

      "abstract": "Social media users may wish to delete their accounts, but it is unclear if this process is easy to complete or if users understand what happens to their account data after deletion. Furthermore, since platforms profit from users' data and activity, they have incentives to maintain active users, possibly affecting what account deletion options are offered. To investigate these issues, we conducted a two-part study. In Study Part 1, we created and deleted accounts on the top 20 social media platforms in the United States and performed an analysis of 490 deletion-related screens across these platforms. In Study Part 2, informed by our interface analysis, we surveyed 200 social media users to understand how users perceive and experience social media account deletion. From these studies, we have four main findings. First, account deletion options vary considerably across platforms and the language used to describe these options is not always clear. Most platforms offer account deletion on desktop browsers but not all allow account deletion from mobile apps or browsers. Second, we found evidence of several dark patterns present in the account deletion interfaces and platform policies. Third, most participants had tried to delete at least one social media account, yet over one-third of deletion attempts were never completed. Fourth, users mostly agreed that they did not want platforms to have access to deleted account data. Based on these results, we recommend that platforms  improve the terminology used in account deletion interfaces so the outcomes of account deletion are more clear to users. Additionally, we recommend that platforms allow users to delete their social media accounts from any device they use to access the platform. Finally, future work is needed to assess how users are affected by account deletion related dark patterns.",

      "abstract": "A number of initiatives invite members of the public to perform online classification tasks such as identifying\r\nobjects or wildlife in images. These tasks are crucial to numerous large-scale Citizen Science projects in different\r\ndisciplines, with volunteers using their knowledge and online support tools to, for example, identify species of\r\nwildlife or classify galaxies by their shapes. However, for complex classification tasks, such as this case study\r\non identifying the species of bumblebee, reaching an agreement between volunteers - or even between experts\r\n- may require consensus-building processes. Collaboration and teamwork approaches to problem solving\r\nand decision-making, have been widely documented to improve both task performance and user learning\r\nin the real world. Most of these processes and projects are mediated online through feedback delivered in\r\nan asynchronous manner, and this article thus addresses a central research question: How do participants\r\ninvolved in species identification tasks respond to different forms of feedback provided in online collaboration,\r\ndesigned to support peer-learning and improve task performance? We tested four different approaches to\r\nfeedback within a collaboration task, where participants reviewed their previously annotated data based on\r\ninformation curated from their peers on a long running online citizen science initiative. The selected interfaces\r\nhave a strong foundation in social science and psychology literature and can be applied to citizen science\r\npractices as well as in other online communities. Results showed that while all four approaches increased\r\naccuracy, there were differences based on the types of consensus that existed before collaboration. Such\r\ndifferences highlighted the usefulness of different forms of feedback during collaboration for increasing data\r\naccuracy of identification and furthering users’ expertise on identification tasks. We found that anonymised\r\nand goal directed free-text comments posted on social learning interfaces were most effective in improving\r\ndata accuracy as well as creating opportunities for peer-learning, particularly where the species identification\r\ntask was more difficult. This study has significant implications for extending the practice of citizen science\r\nacross formal and informal learning environments and reaching out to a variety of users.",

We present the ways in which knowledge about sleep, and how to manipulate it, is collectively shared online. This paper documents the sleep-change practices of four groups of ‘Sleep Hackers’ including Nurses, Polyphasic Sleeper, Over-sleepers, and Biohackers.\r\n\r\nOur thematic analysis uses 1002 posts taken from public forums discussing sleep change. This work reveals the different ways individuals share their experiences and build communal knowledge on how to `hack' their sleep -- from using drugs, external stimulation, isolation, and polyphasic sleeping practices where segmented sleep schedules are shared between peers. We describe how communal discussions around the body and sleep can inform the development of body sensing technology. We discuss the opportunities and implications for designing for bodily agency over sleep changes both in relation to collaboratively developed understandings of the body and social context of the user. We also discuss notions of slowly changing bodily processes and sensory manipulation in relation to how they can build on the exploration of soma-technology. ",

Technologies could increase the effectiveness of CCPs, but we know little about what collaboration challenges technologies must address in this complex clinical setting. To investigate these challenges and technology opportunities, we conducted interviews and contextual inquiries with 30 patients and providers in an obstetric CCP. Using the Parallel Journeys Framework as a lens, we uncover new collaboration challenges (e.g., weighing risks and benefits of treatment, conflicting opinions and ambiguous responsibilities) at the intersection of patients’ obstetric and psychosocial care journeys. We discuss new CSCW implications and technology opportunities, such as the importance of addressing support gaps in cyclical experiences, and the need to resolve provider conflicts to refocus on patient needs. These contributions inform how technologies can support patient engagement and collaboration with providers to access and receive treatment, as well as improve health outcomes.",

      "abstract": "People who are marginalized experience disproportionate harms when their privacy is violated. Meeting their needs is vital for developing equitable and privacy-protective technologies. In response, research at the intersection of privacy and marginalization has acquired newfound urgency in the HCI and social computing community. In this literature review, we set out to understand how researchers have investigated this area of study. What topics have been examined, and how? What are the key findings and recommendations? And, crucially, where do we go from here? Based on a review of papers on privacy and marginalization published in the past 10 years across HCI, Communication, and privacy-focused venues, we make three main contributions: (1) we identify key themes in existing work and introduce the Privacy Responses and Costs framework to describe the tensions around protecting privacy in marginalized contexts, (2) we characterize trends in research practices in this area, including the under-reporting of important methodological choices, and (3) we identify understudied areas for future work, and provide suggestions for conducting research on privacy and marginalization as a step towards establishing shared best practices for this growing area of research.

      "abstract": "Reading academic papers is a fundamental part of higher education and research, but navigating these information-dense texts can be challenging. In particular, low-vision readers using magnification encounter additional barriers to quickly skimming and visually locating information. In this work, we explored the design of interfaces to enable readers to: 1) navigate papers more easily, and 2) input the required navigation hooks that AI cannot currently automate. To explore this design space, we ran two exploratory studies. The first focused on current practices of low-vision paper readers, the challenges they encounter, and the interfaces they desire. During this study, low-vision participants were interviewed, and tried out four new paper navigation prototypes. Results from this study grounded the design of our end-to-end system prototype Ocean, which provides an accessible front-end for low-vision readers, and enables all readers to contribute to the backend by leaving traces of their reading paths for others to leverage. Our second study used this exploratory interface in a field study with groups of low-vision and sighted readers to probe the user experience of reading and creating traces. Our findings suggest that it may be possible for readers of all abilities to organically leave traces in papers, and that these traces can be used to facilitate navigation tasks, in particular for low-vision readers. Based on our findings, we present design considerations for creating future paper-reading tools that improve access, and organically source the required data from readers.",

      "abstract": "How social media platforms could fairly conduct content moderation is gaining attention from society at large. Researchers from HCI and CSCW have investigated whether certain factors could affect how users perceive moderation decisions as fair or unfair. However, little attention has been paid to unpacking or elaborating on the formation processes of users’ perceived (un)fairness from their moderation experiences, especially users who monetize their content. By interviewing 21 for-profit YouTubers (i.e., video content creators), we found three primary ways through which participants assess moderation fairness, including equality across their peers, consistency across moderation decisions and policies, and their voice in algorithmic visibility decision-making processes. Building upon the findings, we discuss how our participants’ fairness perceptions demonstrate a multi-dimensional notion of moderation fairness and how YouTube implements an algorithmic assemblage to moderate YouTubers. We derive transferable design considerations for a fairer moderation system on platforms affording creator monetization.",

      "abstract": "Text-based conversational agents (CAs) are widely deployed across a number of daily tasks, including information retrieval. However, most existing agents follow a default design that disregards user needs and preferences, ultimately leading to a lack of usage and an unsatisfying user experience. More interestingly, deployed CAs are oftentimes not grounded in extant theories. To better understand how CAs can be designed in order to lead to effective system use, we built and tested a question-answering, text-based CA for an information retrieval task in an education scenario. We deduced relevant design requirements from both literature and 13 user interviews. Results from our experimental test with 41 students indicate that following a user-centered design has a significant positive effect on enjoyment with and trust in a CA as opposed to deploying a default CA. Beyond practical implications for effective CA design, this paper points towards key challenges and potential research avenues when deploying social cues for CAs.",

      "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of large-scale labor aggregation platforms, worker analytics, and algorithmic decision-making by management raises the question of whether workers can use similar technologies to advocate for their own goals. Yet, there are inherent challenges in building worker-centric tools that collect, aggregate, and share data in responsible and ethical ways. In this paper, we present the design and deployment of the Shipt Calculator, a tool developed in collaboration with non-profit worker groups that allows app-based delivery workers to track and share aggregate data about their pay, increasing wage transparency. We first discuss the design challenges inherent to building worker-centric technologies, particularly for informally organized workers, and ground our discussion in the history of worker's inquiry and co-research. We then describe some principles from this history and our own lessons in designing the Calculator that can be applied by future researchers and advocates seeking to build technical tools for organizing campaigns. Finally, we share the results of using the Calculator to audit an app's shift to a black-box pay model using data contributed by 140 workers in the Summer of 2020, finding that although the average pay per-order increased under the new payment model, almost half of workers experienced an unannounced pay cut during the shift, and many workers worked shifts that paid under their state\\'s minimum wage. Finally, we discuss how tools like the Calculator demonstrate the important role that aggregate worker data, and a new Digital Workerism, can serve in creating and maintaining a more balanced platform economy.",

      "abstract": "Many romance novelists have shifted to self-publishing mediated through online technologies, such as online retailer platforms for selling novels and social media for marketing. However, engagement with such complex algorithmic systems has posed challenges, including understanding continually changing algorithms, frequently changing silently, impacting novelists' successful professionalization and monetization. We conducted surveys and interviews with romance novelists to examine how they experience, interpret, and navigate algorithms. Our findings detail interviewees' efforts to comprehend algorithms, both individually and collectively, and leverage that comprehension to navigate and manipulate algorithms. We discuss how our interviewees constructed literacy of precarious algorithms on their work platforms, suggesting implications for designing algorithmic systems supporting digital work.",

      "abstract": "Posting help-seeking requests on social media has been broadly adopted by victims during natural disasters to look for urgent rescue and supplies. The help-seeking requests need to get sufficient public attention and be promptly routed to the intended target(s) for timely responses. However, the huge volume and diverse types of crisis-related posts on social media might limit help-seeking requests to receive adequate engagement and lead to their overwhelm. To understand this problem, this work proposes a mixed-methods approach to figure out the overwhelm situation of help-seeking requests, and individuals' and online communities' strategies to cope. We focused on the 2021 Henan Floods in China and collected 141,674 help-seeking posts with the keyword \"Henan Rainstorm Mutual Aid\" on a popular Chinese social media platform Weibo. The findings indicate that help-seeking posts confront critical challenges of both external overwhelm (i.e., an enormous number of non-help-seeking posts with the help-seeking-related keyword distracting public attention) and internal overwhelm (i.e., attention inequality with 5\\% help-seeking posts receiving more than 95\\% likes, comments, and shares). We discover linguistic and non-linguistic help-seeking strategies that could help to prevent the overwhelm, such as including contact information, disclosing situational vulnerabilities, using subjective narratives, and structuring help-seeking posts to a normalized syntax. We also illustrate how community members spontaneously work to prevent the overwhelm with their collective wisdom (e.g., norm development through discussion) and collaborative work (e.g., cross-community support). We reflect on how the findings enrich the literature in crisis informatics and raise design implications that facilitate effective help-seeking on social media during natural disasters.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Community Question Answering Websites (CQAs) like Stack Overflow rely on continuous user contributions to keep their services active. Nevertheless, they often undergo a sharp decline in their user participation during the holiday season, undermining their performance. To address this issue, some CQAs have developed their own special promotional gamification schemes to incentivize users to maintain their contributions throughout the holiday season. These promotional gamification schemes are often time-limited, optional, and run alongside the default gamification schemes of their websites. However, the impact of such promotional gamification schemes on user behavior remains largely unexplored in the existing literature. This paper takes the first steps toward filling this knowledge gap by conducting a large-scale empirical study of a particular promotional gamification scheme on the CQA of Stack Overflow (referred to as Winter Bash (WB)). According to our findings, promotional gamification schemes may not be the panacea they are portrayed to be. For example, in the case of WB, we find that the scheme is not effective for improving the collective engagement of all users. Only some particular user types (i.e., experienced and reputable users) are often provoked under WB. Most novice users, who comprise the majority of this website's user base, seem to be indifferent to such a gamification scheme. Another contribution of our work is that it shows the importance of studying the quantity and quality of user engagement in unison to better understand the effectiveness of a gamification scheme. Previous gamification studies in the literature have focused predominantly on studying the quantity of user engagement alone. Last but not least, we conclude our paper by presenting some practical considerations for improving the design of future promotional gamification schemes in CQAs or similar platforms.",

We steer the focus away from the design of technology as the central force of technological innovation, and instead support participants to reflect and describe intimate details that highlight specific use-contexts of technology in their lives. We leverage  a group of foreign graduate student mothers' self-described unique strengths to gain an in-depth account of their lived experiences with technology. As research participants and co-authors, our collaborators elicit intimate narratives about meaningful events in their lives, bringing social and cultural aspects of their lived experience to the forefront, and thus providing broader context of their use of technology. We detail and reflect upon our approach of promoting user agency by creating an affinity group, fostering a safe and intimate space for research engagement, and describe the implications of using our adapted research methodology in intimate settings. We conclude by highlighting the various ways in which technology facilitates foreign student parenting, as well as the ways in which it serves as a temporary band-aid solution, prompting consideration of larger social issues.

      "abstract": "The farmers' movement began in November 2020, when more than 300,000 protesters marched towards New Delhi in India in opposition to new agrarian acts introduced by the Indian central government. Organised by over 400 farmers' unions along with other organisations, for the next year, farmers and allied protesters set up bases around New Delhi and sustained the movement leading to its eventual success. We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with participants from the movement and explored the social organisation, the underlying technical infrastructures, and how collective action was organised. We outline how the social media ecosystem enabled hybrid forms of organisational structures and facilitated coalition-building between diverse groups. Further, the movement created and disseminated alternative media that opposed mainstream media narratives and facilitated community-building. We discuss how designed technologies and spaces can support social movements in the face of powerful antagonistic actors.",

      "abstract": "Millions of people participate in online peer-to-peer support sessions, yet there has been little prior research on systematic psychology-based evaluations of fine-grained peer-counselor behavior in relation to client satisfaction. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by mapping peer-counselor chat-messages to motivational interviewing (MI) techniques. We annotate 14,797 utterances from 734 chat conversations using 17 MI techniques and introduce four new interviewing codes such as “chit-chat” and inappropriate” to account for the unique conversational patterns observed on online platforms. We automate the process of labeling peer-counselor responses to MI techniques by fine-tuning large domain-specific language models and then use these automated measures to investigate the behavior of the peer counselors via correlational studies. Specifically, we study the impact of MI techniques on the conversation ratings to investigate the techniques that predict clients’ satisfaction with their counseling sessions. When counselors use techniques such as reflection and affirmation, clients are more satisfied. Examining volunteer counselors’ change in usage of techniques suggest that counselors learn to use more introduction and open questions as they gain experience. This work provides a deeper understanding of the use of motivational interviewing techniques on peer-to-peer counselor platforms and sheds light on how to build better training programs for volunteer counselors on online platforms.",

Productive multitasking, such as taking notes, browsing for relevant information, etc., can help promote the cognitive attentiveness of participants. However, existing approaches of tagging inattentive participants solely based on their visual concentration on the meeting app fail to work in such instances. This paper proposes EmotiConf-- a novel real-time framework to monitor participants' attentiveness and a non-real-time framework for visual multitask detection without explicitly relying on their visual concentration. EmotiConf utilizes an unconventional observation where the emotional states of attentive participants, captured through their facial expressions, correlate and also correspond to the vocal expression of the speaker and the intent of the speech. Accordingly, EmotiConf develops a software wrapper to tag the inattentive participants while also characterizing visual multitasking instances performed by them. A thorough evaluation of EmotiConf confirms its usability with a high score of >80. ",

Augmented reality and sensors which detect biosignals both have the potential to support creating mindful experiences, by transforming people’s environments into more relaxing spaces and offering some feedback to help people make sense of their physio-psychological states. We will demo Mindful Garden, a system for supporting reflection on biosignals in a mindfulness experience where two people are physically co-located. Mindful Garden has one person guide the other through meditation, representing the guided individual’s biosignals as flowers in a shared augmented reality environment. We leverage Snap Spectacles and a Muse 2 headband, showing the promise of ready-to-use consumer technologies for the purpose of mindfulness and well-being. To overcome technical limitations in accessing, our demo illustrates a novel pipeline for real-time biomarker data streaming from the Muse 2 to the AR lens in the Snap Spectacles.",

To support this research, we developed a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) system enabling experimenters to play the role of the conversational agent who must work with a team of three human participants to herd together a group of autonomous robots (target agents) within a virtual task environment. The experimenter can select from one of several tailored responses. The aim of this environment is to determine whether the identified responses facilitate effective team performance and to collect training data to build a conversational agent capable of engaging in team based virtual learning environments.",

However, the \"all-or-nothing\" approach to access control taken by most smart home applications may be insufficient for use cases that involve others outside of the home. Therefore, we developed “MiSu” an Android and iOS app that allows smart home homeowners to share their devices (e.g., Ring doorbell, security alarm, smart door lock, smart light bulb) with people outside of their home to control what, when, and how they can engage with the smart devices. MiSu provides options for fine-grain access control, the ability for guests to control smart homes using their own device and login, and provides homeowners real-time logs where they can view all actions taken by guests invited to interact with their smart homes.",

Much of this information is very sensitive, and users often struggle to manage these accesses due to their lack of tech expertise and knowledge regarding mobile privacy. Thus, they often seek help from others to make decisions regarding their mobile privacy and security. We embedded these social processes in a mobile app titled “CO-oPS” (\"Community Oversight for Privacy and Security\"). CO-oPS allows trusted community members to review one another’s apps installed and permissions granted to those apps. Community members can provide feedback to one another regarding their privacy behaviors. Users are also allowed to hide some of their mobile apps that they do not like others to see, ensuring their personal privacy.",

      "abstract": "There is a growing effort within CSCW and related fields to understand the effects of artificial intelligence, algorithmic management, and other contemporary and near-future transformations of digitally-mediated work. This panel builds on this effort by asking three guiding questions: how should academics more fully account for the consequences of new transformations in the workplace, how should we engage with workers who are already accounting for the ways that these systems impact their labor conditions and experience of work, and how should we be made accountable to workers for the design interventions we propose or deploy. The panelists will discuss topics including the impact of AI technology on frontline and essential workers, the transformative effect of algorithmic management on organizational practices within and beyond platform work, and how demands and efforts to attain algorithmic transparency by platform/gig-workers both reveal power imbalances within the workplaces and point to avenues for worker advocacy. We will also draw on scholarship that analyzes the shifting labor conditions of CSCW to situate contemporary concerns within the field‚Äôs disciplinary history. We aim to generate conversation about the ways that these forms of accountability have already been unfolding, identify shared themes and concerns across parallel topics, and identify future directions for researchers moving forward in this space.",

      "abstract": "Consent has become an important concept across multiple areas within HCI/CSCW, community advocacy work, and the tech industry, for understanding social computing problems and designing safe and agentic computer-mediated communication. Recent research has studied consent in various topics, such as online-to-offline interaction and harm, data privacy and security, research ethics, and human-robot interaction. The goal of this panel is to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss how consent has been defined and studied within HCI and adjacent fields, and how cross-field discourse around consent can inform future work that pursues safe and equitable computing. We aim to introduce consent as a multifaceted research and design lens to the HCI and CSCW community and illuminate ways that consent can contribute to better understanding or re-imagination of contemporary research interests. Lastly, the panel aims to spark cross-field communication around consent to identify latent connections across research topics and foster synergistic collaborations.",

      "abstract": "New technologies have the potential to expand the spatial and temporal bounds of various social exchanges. It therefore becomes possible to incorporate more people and territories, and enlarge networks of cooperation of various forms for various ends. This, indeed, has been the premise of contemporary globalization: affordable, ubiquitous computing technologies to create an economy that works as a unit in real time at a planetary scale.\n  \n  Long before computing networks provided the technological infrastructure for globalization, or computer science attempted to understand cooperation, the social sciences grappled with the question of why and how people cooperate. Economists, for instance, have viewed it in terms of the emergence of a division of labour, supported by technology, to fulfill various needs. However, any narrative suggesting the frictionless incorporation of different people and territories into the global economy overlooks how social contracts, which political theorists and sociologists highlight as the basis for cooperation, can be asymmetric due to power differentials between social actors. The asymmetry is another manifestation of the socio-spatial unevenness that has historically characterized capitalism.\n  \n  The unevenness in our times has not gone unnoticed as evidenced by efforts to address the needs of those on the wrong side of the digital divide, or at the bottom-of-the-pyramid, with such initiatives as frugal innovation, or technologies for inclusive development. After a brief survey of such efforts since the turn of the millennium, the presentation will draw on ongoing research in India to describe how digital platforms mediate the last-mile delivery of services, from producers to their customers, by relying on increasing numbers of smartphone-armed gig worker ‚Äòpartners‚Äô. The presentation will argue that, as platform companies deploy technology and rely on asymmetrical contractual relationships to reconfigure the division of labour in service-delivery, workers find themselves in unequal partnerships to experience CSCW as Computer Supported Coercive Work.",

We interviewed 20 healthcare providers in asthma care to envision future technologies to support their PGHD use. We found that healthcare providers desire future AI systems to enhance their ability to treat patients by analyzing PGHD for profiling risk and predicting deterioration. Despite the benefits that AI could bring, providers perceived various challenges of AI use of PGHD, including added burden, lack of trust toward AI, and fear of being replaced by AI. Clinicians wished for a future of co-dependent human-AI collaboration, where AI will help them to improve their clinical practice. In turn, providers can improve AI systems by making AI outputs more trustworthy and humane. We discuss the importance of considering context and aligning the complex human infrastructure before designing or deploying PGHD-based AI systems in clinical settings. We point out the opportunity to design for Human-AI enrichment, where humans and AI not only partner with each other for improved performance, but also enrich each other to make each other better at work overtime.",

      "abstract": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses have faced unprecedented challenges when trying to remain open. Because COVID-19 spreads through aerosolized droplets, businesses were forced to distance their services; in some cases, distancing may have involved moving business services online. In this work, we explore digitization strategies used by small businesses that remained open during the pandemic, and survey/interview small businesses owners to understand preliminary challenges associated with moving online. Furthermore, we analyze payments from 400K businesses across Japan, Australia, United States, Great Britain, and Canada. Following initial government interventions, we observe (at minimum for each country) a 47% increase in digitizing businesses compared to pre-pandemic levels, with about 80% of surveyed businesses digitizing in under a week. From both our quantitative models and our surveys/interviews, we find that businesses rapidly digitized at the start of the pandemic in preparation of future uncertainty. We also conduct a case-study of initial digitization in the United States, examining finer relationships between specific government interventions, business sectors, political orientation, and resulting digitization shifts. Finally, we discuss the implications of rapid & widespread digitization for small businesses in the context of usability challenges and interpersonal interactions, while highlighting potential shifts in pre-existing social norms.",

      "abstract": "Patient work encompasses a challenging set of activities necessary for learning about and managing chronic conditions over time. Many patient-centered health technology interventions focus on supporting types of patient work, such as symptom tracking, medication adherence, and information sharing between patients and providers. However, people may not always follow, or may actively resist, the activities prescribed by their formal patient role. In this paper, we present three case studies about patients with different chronic conditions to critically reflect on the types of patient behavior commonly taken up in health technology design as acts of “noncompliance.” Detailing conflicts that emerge when patients are caught between meeting their personal needs and following clinical best practices, we show how everyday life and health system goals are often misaligned in ways that can’t be easily reconciled through current design approaches. As a way forward, we argue for alternative ways of understanding the tensions routinely shaping people’s healthcare experiences. We introduce the term care frictions as a sensitizing concept useful for helping designers reframe “noncompliant” behaviors as legitimate forms of patient work. Our paper also offers design considerations—both on challenges and generative possibilities—for future CSCW research seeking to support a wider breadth of patient behavior. In this, we call attention to the value of designer and researcher reflexivity in making visible the problematic assumptions in health technology design that can lead to social and emotional patient harms.",

      "abstract": "We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 users of the exposure notification app COVID Alert. We identified several types of users' mental models of COVID Alert. Participants' concerns were found to be correlated with their understanding of the app. Compared to a centralized contact tracing app, COVID Alert was favored due to its more efficient notification delivery method, its higher privacy protection level, and the personal choice to cooperate. Based on the findings, we suggest decision-makers rethink the app's privacy-utility trade-off to improve its utility by giving users more control over their data. We also suggest that technology companies build and maintain trust with the public. Further, we recommend increasing diagnosed users' motivation to notify the app and encouraging exposed users to follow the guidelines. Last, we provide design suggestions to help users with Unsound and Innocent mental models better understand the app.",

      "abstract": "While artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise for supporting healthcare providers and improving the accuracy of medical diagnoses, a lack of transparency in the composition of datasets exposes AI models to the possibility of unintentional and avoidable mistakes. In particular, public and private image datasets of dermatological conditions rarely include information on skin color. As a start towards increasing transparency, AI researchers have appropriated the use of the Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) from a measure of patient photosensitivity to a measure for estimating skin tone in algorithmic audits of computer vision applications including facial recognition and dermatology diagnosis. In order to understand the variability of estimated FST annotations on images, we compare several FST annotation methods on a diverse set of 460 images of skin conditions from both textbooks and online dermatology atlases. These methods include expert annotation by board-certified dermatologists, algorithmic annotation via the Individual Typology Angle algorithm, which is then converted to estimated FST (ITA-FST), and two crowd-sourced, dynamic consensus protocols for annotating estimated FSTs. We find the inter-rater reliability between three board-certified dermatologists is comparable to the inter-rater reliability between the board-certified dermatologists and either of the crowdsourcing methods. In contrast, we find that the ITA-FST method produces annotations that are significantly less correlated with the experts' annotations than the experts' annotations are correlated with each other. These results demonstrate that algorithms based on ITA-FST are not reliable for annotating large-scale image datasets, but human-centered, crowd-based protocols can reliably add skin type transparency to dermatology datasets. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of dynamic consensus protocols with tunable parameters including expert review that increase the visibility of crowdwork and provide guidance for future crowdsourced annotations of large image datasets.",

As a secondary task, it conflicts though with the fabrication activity, and thus it is often forgotten and knowledge resources end up incomplete.In this article, we investigate different dimensions of content capture for knowledge resources in fabrication workshops.Based on past work in this area, we first propose a framework through which we identify two research directions to investigate. From these, we derive three dimensions to explore in more depth: The number of capturing devices, their feature variety and the degree of automation of each feature. \r\nWe then explore the design space resulting from these three dimensions with the help of a design concept and an online survey study (N=66). Results show (1) a variety of needs and preferences justifying feature variety and multiplicity, (2) challenges in defining the right degree of manual and automatic control, and (3) the socio-technical impact of cameras in a shared space regarding privacy and ethics. We conclude with discussions on the benefits and vulnerabilities of equipping fabrication workshop with distributed camera-based capturing devices and offer opportunities for design.",

This paper presents results from a controlled experiment investigating effects related to different strategies for promoting discussion at news websites (N=336 participants).  The strategies include highlighting specific comments about a data visualization, providing prompts with the comments, and annotating prompts to the visualization. By comparison to a simple list of comments (baseline), our analysis found that annotations contributed to higher levels of participant engagement in the discussion, yet lower levels of knowledge retention related to the article.  These findings raise new considerations about whether and how to integrate discussion content into news and points toward future content moderation systems that assist in representing and eliciting discussion with design elements in news websites.",

      "abstract": "In order to sustain everyday life in India during pandemic induced lockdowns, home service gig platforms materialized to provide essential services for urban society. As unemployment worsened, these gig platforms also emerged as key sources of paid work for gig workers, with some platforms promising an unusual degree of health and financial support for their gig workforce. Through semi-structured interviews, we examine how women beauty workers engaged with the infrastructural promise extended by home service gig platforms during the pandemic. While, in the context of the global south, gig platforms promoted the potential of stable income and social security, we investigate the reality behind the image. We find that various breakdowns, from miscommunication around localized travel restrictions to limited platform helpline access, introduces day-to-day unpredictability for gig workers, hindering access to paid work as well as other platform extended benefits. We suggest that home service gig platforms actually serve as ‘faux infrastructure,’ in which the privatized logics of corporate platforms work to enclose public value, while pushing the burden of access onto gig workers who must perform additional, often unpaid labors in order to fill last-mile service gaps.",

It is therefore important to understand how perceptions of such apps are formed in different regions, which may contribute to adoption. We conducted a replication of prior work in the United States with participants from India (n = 416) between November 9, 2020 and January 3, 2021. We identified factors that predict perceptions of pandemic-tracking apps: social orientation, prior use of health-related technology, and demographics. We found that privacy concerns did not predict perceptions, suggesting that privacy may not be a suitable singular lens through which to study the perception of, and expectation to use, pandemic-tracking apps in India. We make several recommendations for future pandemic-preparedness campaigns and identify the need to continue the trend toward contextualizing privacy-centered research with privacy-adjacent individual factors across multiple regions.",

      "abstract": "Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers have long studied how technology can support collaborative care work in clinical and informal settings. We draw attention to the broader social, political, and economic conditions within which such care work and technologies for caring are embedded. The COVID-19 pandemic has made visible the exploitation of care and\ncare workers that technology can be complicit in enabling, as well as the frequently gendered and racialized nature of care work. Our paper offers an analysis of an emerging digital ecosystem in frontline health work during the COVID-19 pandemic where these dynamics become highly visible. We conducted interviews with women frontline health workers in Haryana (India) to investigate their experiences with the digitization of various aspects of their work such as data collection, coordination, training, and financial compensation. We describe the top-down transition to technology-mediated workflows, the social organization of care, and the labor politics surrounding digital workflows. We then identify four interconnected ways in which health workers attempted to build more caring futures for themselves and their communities, by focusing on survival, resilience, advocacy, and resistance. Finally, we offer these as care orientations that CSCW and HCI researchers may adopt to critically reflect on and direct technology design towards enabling more caring futures for care workers and communities.",

      "abstract": "The limited information (data voids) on political topics relevant to underrepresented communities has facilitated the spread of disinformation. Independent journalists who combat disinformation in underrepresented communities have reported feeling overwhelmed because they lack the tools necessary to make sense of the information they monitor and address the data voids. In this paper, we present a system to identify and address political data voids within underrepresented communities. Armed with an interview study, indicating that the independent news media has the potential to address them, we designed an intelligent collaborative system, called Datavoidant. Datavoidant uses state-of-the-art machine learning models and introduces a novel design space to provide independent journalists with a collective understanding of data voids to facilitate generating content to cover the voids. We performed a user interface evaluation with independent news media journalists (N=22). These journalists reported that Datavoidant's features allowed them to more rapidly while easily having a sense of what was taking place in the information ecosystem to address the data voids. They also reported feeling more confident about the content they created and the unique perspectives they had proposed to cover the voids. We conclude by discussing how Datavoidant enables a new design space wherein individuals can collaborate to make sense of their information ecosystem and actively devise strategies to prevent disinformation.",

We conducted 23 semi-structured interviews with participants from India, the Middle East and North Africa, and the United States to engage in infrastructural speculation about the humanistic vulnerabilities that pandemic-tracking apps may create. Through interpretive analysis, we examine the relationship between persistent discomfort and vulnerability. Such examination yields three forms of vulnerability: real, anticipatory, and speculative. By identifying and defining forms of vulnerability through an analysis of people's pandemic-related thoughts and experiences, we further develop the overlapping discourses of humanistic infrastructure studies and infrastructural speculation. In doing so, we explore the temporality of vulnerability itself and present implications for the humanistic study of vulnerability in HCI and for the oversight of app-based public health surveillance.",

Prior work has focused on how robots may have an immediate effect on individual employees or tasks rather than their gradual influences on employees collectively or their organization over time.  By drawing on fourteen in-situ interviews with six cobot operators in a Danish manufacturing company, this paper investigates how collaborative robots (cobots) in the manufacturing context may engage broader interactions beyond the robot-operator interaction. This includes spatial configurations centering around the cobots, social interactions among employees, and information flow through, within, or outside the production cell. Introducing and implementing cobots has social dynamics at its core, which we explore in-depth. This paper argues that the design of cobots and the environment around them should accommodate the possibility of more complicated social and organizational changes brought about by these robots. Lastly, we discuss research and design implications for the future of workplaces involving robots.",

      "abstract": "As machine learning methods become more powerful and capture more nuances of human behavior, biases in the dataset can shape what the model learns and is evaluated on. This paper explores and attempts to quantify the uncertainties and biases due to \\textit{annotator} demographics when creating sentiment analysis datasets. We ask $>$1000 crowdworkers to provide their demographic information and annotations for multimodal sentiment data and its component modalities. We show that demographic differences among annotators impute a significant effect on their ratings, and that these effects also occur in each component modality. We compare predictions of different state-of-the-art multimodal machine learning algorithms against annotations provided by different demographic groups, and find that changing annotator demographics can cause $>$4.5\\% in accuracy difference when determining positive versus negative sentiment. Our findings underscore the importance of accounting for crowdworker attributes, such as demographics, when building datasets, evaluating algorithms, and interpreting results for sentiment analysis.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning models are commonly used to detect toxicity in online conversations. These models are trained on datasets annotated by human raters. We explore how raters' self-described identities impact how they annotate toxicity in online comments. We first define the concept of Specialized rater pools: rater pools formed based on raters' self-described identities, rather than at random. We formed three such rater pools for this study - specialized rater pools of raters from the U.S. who identify as African American,  LGBTQ, and those who identify as neither. Each of these rater pools annotated the same set of comments, which contains many references to these identity groups. We found that rater identity is a statistically significant factor in how raters will annotate toxicity for identity-related annotations. Using preliminary content analysis, we examined the comments with the most disagreement between rater pools and found nuanced differences in the toxicity annotations. Next, we trained models on the annotations from each of the different rater pools, and compared the scores of these models on comments from several test sets. Finally, we discuss how using raters that self-identify with the subjects of comments can create more inclusive machine learning models, and provide more nuanced ratings than those by random raters.",

      "abstract": "People often take user ratings/reviews into consideration when shopping for products or services online. However, such user-generated data contains self-selection bias that could affect people’s decisions and it is hard to resolve this issue completely by algorithms. In this work, we propose to raise people’s awareness of the self-selection bias by making three types of information concerning user ratings/reviews transparent. We distill these three pieces of information, i.e., reviewers’ experience, the extremity of emotion, and reported aspect(s), from the definition of self-selection bias and exploration of related literature. We further conduct an online survey to assess people’s perceptions of the usefulness of such information and identify the exact facets (e.g., negative emotion) people care about in their decision process. Then, we propose a visual design to make such details behind user reviews transparent and integrate the design into an experimental website for evaluation. The results of a between-subjects study demonstrate that our bias-aware design significantly increases people’s awareness of bias and their satisfaction with decision-making. We further offer a series of design implications for improving information transparency and awareness of bias in user-generated content.",

      "abstract": "Because algorithm audits are conducted by technical experts, audits are necessarily limited to the hypotheses that experts think to test. End users hold the promise to expand this purview, as they inhabit spaces and witness algorithmic impacts that auditors do not. In pursuit of this goal, we propose end-user audits—system-scale audits led by non-technical users—and present an approach that scaffolds end users in hypothesis generation, evidence identification, and results communication. Today, performing a system-scale audit requires substantial user effort to label thousands of system outputs, so we introduce a collaborative filtering technique that leverages the algorithmic system's own disaggregated training data to project from a small number of end user labels onto the full test set. Our end-user auditing tool, IndieLabel, employs these projected labels so that users can rapidly explore where their opinions diverge from the algorithmic system's outputs. By highlighting topic areas where the system is under-performing for the user and surfacing sets of likely error cases, the tool guides the user in authoring an audit report. In an evaluation of end-user audits on a popular comment toxicity model with 17 non-technical participants, participants both replicated issues that formal audits had previously identified and also raised previously underreported issues such as under-flagging on veiled forms of hate that perpetuate stigma and over-flagging of slurs that have been reclaimed by marginalized communities.",

      "abstract": "In online group discussions, balanced participation can improve the quality of discussion, members’ satisfaction, and positive group dynamics. One approach to achieve balanced participation is to deploy a conversational agent (CA) that encourages participation of under-contributing members, and it is important to design communication strategies of the CA in a way that is supportive to the group. We implemented five communication strategies that a CA can use during a decision-making task in a small group synchronous chat discussion. The five strategies include messages sent to two types of recipients (@username vs. @everyone) crossed by two separate channels (public vs. private), and a peer-mediated strategy where the CA asks a peer to address the under-contributing member. Through an online study with 42 groups, we measured the balance of participation and perceptions about the CA by analyzing chat logs and survey responses. We found that the CA sending messages specifying an individual through a private channel is the most effective and preferred way to increase participation of under-contributing members. Participants also expressed that the peer-mediated strategy is a less intrusive and less embarrassing way of receiving the CA's messages compared to the conventional approach where the CA directly sends a message to the under-contributing member. Based on our findings, we discuss trade-offs of various communication strategies and explain design considerations for building an effective CA that adapts to different group dynamics and situations.",

      "abstract": "Voice dictation is increasingly used for text entry, especially in mobile scenarios. However, the speech-based experience gets disrupted when users must go back to a screen and keyboard to review and edit the text. While existing dictation systems focus on improving transcription and error correction, little is known about how to support speech input for the entire text creation process, including composition, reviewing and editing. We conducted an experiment in which ten pairs of participants took on the roles of authors and typists to work on a text authoring task. By analysing the natural language patterns of both authors and typists, we identified new challenges and opportunities for the design of future dictation interfaces, including the ambiguity of human dictation, the differences between audio-only and with screen, and various passive and active assistance that can potentially be provided by future systems.

      "abstract": "Crowd-powered conversational systems (CPCS) are gaining considerable attention for their potential utility in a variety of application domains, for which automated conversational interfaces are still too limited. CPCS currently suffer from long response delays, which hampers their potential as conversational partners. The majority of prior work in this area has focused on demonstrating the feasibility of the approach and improving performance, while evaluation studies have primarily focused on  response latency and ways to reduce it. Relatively little is currently known about how response delays in a CPCS can affect  user experience. While the importance of reducing response latency is widely recognized in the broader field of human-computer interaction, little attention has been paid to how response quality, response delay, conversational context, and the complexity of the task affect how users experience the conversation, and how they perceive waiting for responses in particular. We conducted a  between-subjects experiment (N = 478), to examine the influence of these four factors on the overall waiting experience of users. Results show that users 1) evaluated the waiting experience more negatively when the response delay was longer than 8 seconds, 2) underestimated the elapsed time but experienced more frustration in tasks with high complexity, 3) underestimated the elapsed time and experienced less frustration with high quality bot’s utterances, 4) judged response delays to be slightly longer, and experienced more frustration in an emotion-centric CPCS compared to a task-centric CPCS. Our insights can inform the design of future CPCSs with regards to defining performance requirements and anticipating their potential impact on the user experience they can facilitate.",

      "abstract": "Despite the widespread adoption of computational notebooks, little is known about best practices for their usage in collaborative contexts. In this paper, we fill this gap by eliciting a catalog of best practices for collaborative data science with computational notebooks. With this aim, we first look for best practices through a multivocal literature review. Then, we conduct interviews with professional data scientists to assess their awareness of these best practices. Finally, we assess the adoption of best practices through the analysis of 1,380 Jupyter notebooks retrieved from the Kaggle platform. Findings reveal that experts are mostly aware of the best practices and tend to adopt them in their daily work. Nonetheless, they do not consistently follow all the recommendations as, depending on specific contexts, some are deemed unfeasible or counterproductive due to the lack of proper tool support. As such, we envision the design of notebook solutions that allow data scientists not to have to prioritize exploration and rapid prototyping over writing code of quality.",

      "abstract": "Data is central to the development and evaluation of machine learning (ML) models. However, the use of problematic or inappropriate datasets can result in harms when the resulting models are deployed. To encourage responsible AI practice through more deliberate reflection on datasets and transparency around the processes by which they are created, researchers and practitioners have begun to advocate for increased data documentation and have proposed several data documentation frameworks. However, there is little research on whether these data documentation frameworks meet the needs of ML practitioners, who both create and consume datasets. To address this gap, we set out to understand ML practitioners' data documentation perceptions, needs, challenges, and desiderata, with the ultimate goal of deriving design requirements that can inform future data documentation frameworks. We conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with 14 ML practitioners at a single large, international technology company. We had them answer a list of questions taken from datasheets for datasets. Our findings show that current approaches to data documentation are largely ad hoc and myopic in nature. Participants expressed needs for data documentation frameworks to be adaptable to their contexts, integrated into their existing tools and workflows, and automated wherever possible. Despite the fact that data documentation frameworks are often motivated from the perspective of responsible AI, participants did not make the connection between the questions that they were asked to answer and their responsible AI implications. In addition, participants often had difficulties prioritizing the needs of dataset consumers and providing information that someone unfamiliar with their datasets might need to know. Based on these findings, we derive seven design requirements for future data documentation frameworks such as more actionable guidance on how the characteristics of datasets might result in harms and how these harms might be mitigated, more explicit prompts for reflection, automated adaptation to different contexts, and integration into ML practitioners' existing tools and workflows.",

      "abstract": "Several strands of research have aimed to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence (AI) and human decision-makers in AI-assisted decision-making, where humans are the consumers of AI model predictions and the ultimate decision-makers in high-stakes applications. However, people’s perception and understanding are often distorted by their cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, anchoring bias, availability bias, to name a few. In this work, we use knowledge from the field of cognitive science to account for cognitive biases in the human-AI collaborative decision-making setting, and mitigate their negative effects on collaborative performance. To this end, we mathematically model cognitive biases and provide a general framework through which researchers and practitioners can understand the interplay between cognitive biases and human-AI accuracy. We then focus specifically on anchoring bias, a bias commonly encountered in human-AI collaboration. We implement a time-based de-anchoring strategy and conduct our first user experiment that validates its effectiveness in human-AI collaborative decision-making. With this result, we design a time allocation strategy for a resource-constrained setting that achieves optimal human-AI collaboration under some assumptions. We, then, conduct a second user experiment which shows that our time allocation strategy with explanation can effectively de-anchor the human and improve collaborative performance when the AI model has low confidence and is incorrect.",

      "abstract": "In developing countries suffering from a severe shortage of physicians, the follow-up clinical consultation of long-term chronic care becomes a high-speed collaborative work, which has to be conducted in a few minutes. Although much existing work studies how time factors affect physicians’ workflows and requirements for information systems, high-speed chronic care is yet to be well investigated. This work bridges the gap by presenting a case of a pediatric hospital in China. We focus on the processes of follow-up consultations, the factors enabling physicians to complete consultation in several minutes, as well as the challenges faced by physicians and patients. Through observations and interviews, we find that physicians conduct multiple tasks (information acquisition, patient-provider communication, and medical data documentation) simultaneously to reduce the consultation duration. Adopting an information summary alternative is the key to fast information acquisition. Templates and references in EMR contribute to rapid documentation and prescription. However,multitasking brings physicians a heavy cognitive load. It also severely compresses the duration of patient-provider communication. As a result, some of the patients’ needs, especially emotional ones, are neglected.Based on these findings, we discuss the characteristics and requirements of high-speed chronic care and accordingly propose design suggestions.",

      "abstract": "Interactive software offers the potential to improve the quality of mental health care by promoting skill development, clinical insight, and shared reflection among mental health professionals. However, research on therapists’ usage of interactive software has been primarily based in training and mock-clinical settings. In this paper, we present a qualitative study of clinicians’ experience using CORE-MI, a collaborative recording and annotation software, in a real-world university counseling center. We describe how and why therapists, both trainees and licensed staff, used CORE-MI to support their practice and improve their skills. We also consider how usage varied with therapists’ developmental level and how the software impacted relationships between supervisors and supervisees. Finally, we offer recommendations for future research and design of interactive systems in mental health settings.",

      "abstract": "Participation in communities is essential to individual mental and physical health and can yield further benefits for members. With a growing amount of time spent participating in virtual communities, it's increasingly important that we understand how the community experience manifests in and varies across these online spaces. In this paper, we investigate Sense of Virtual Community (SOVC) in the context of live-streaming communities. Through a survey of 1,944 Twitch viewers, we identify that community experiences on Twitch vary along two primary dimensions: belonging}, a feeling of membership and support within the group, and cohesion, a feeling that the group is a well-run collective with standards for behavior. Leveraging the Social-Ecological Model, we map behavioral trace data from usage logs to various levels of the social ecology surrounding an individual user's participation within a community, in order to identify which of these can be associated with lower or higher SOVC. We find that features describing activity at the individual and community levels, but not features describing the community member's dyadic relationships, can aid in predicting the SOVC that community members feel within channels. We consider implications for the design of live-streaming communities and for fostering the well-being of their members, and we consider theoretical implications for the study of SOVC in modern, interactive online contexts, including those beyond livestreaming communities. We also explore how the Social-Ecological Model can be leveraged in other contexts relevant to Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), with implications for future work.",

      "abstract": "Where do the most popular online cultural artifacts such as image memes originate? Media narratives suggest that cultural innovations often originate in peripheral communities and then diffuse to the mainstream core; behavioral science suggests that intermediate network positions that bridge between the periphery and the core are especially likely to originate many influential cultural innovations. Research has yet to fully adjudicate between these predictions because prior work focuses on individual platforms such as Twitter; however, any single platform is only a small, incomplete part of the larger online cultural ecosystem. In this paper, we perform the first analysis of the origins and diffusion of image memes at web scale, via a one-month crawl of all indexible online communities that principally share meme images with English text overlays. Our results suggest that communities at the core of the network originate the most highly diffused image memes: the top 10% of communities by network centrality originate the memes that generate 62% of the image meme diffusion events on the web. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression confirms that memes from core communities are more likely to diffuse than those from peripheral communities even when controlling for community size and activity level. However, a replication analysis that follows the traditional approach of testing the same question only within a single large community, Reddit, finds the regression coefficients reversed---underscoring the importance of engaging in web-scale, cross-community analyses. The ecosystem-level viewpoint of this work positions the web as a highly centralized generator of cultural artifacts such as image memes.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic greatly changed many people’s daily life. Because of the temporary closure of gym and fitness centers, many people started to take group fitness classes online. The abrupt transition to synchronous online exercise brought lots of uncertainty and challenges to fitness instructors and participants. This study aims to understand how people teach and participate in live stream group fitness classes, the challenges they have encountered, and their practices to address these challenges. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 instructors and 14 participants who had experience teaching or taking live stream group fitness classes on Zoom during the pandemic. Our interviews showed that instructors saw teaching online as a new, more cognitively demanding experience than teaching in-person classes; they found limited resources to create a professional workout space, experienced stress and anxiety, had limited information and approaches to give participants feedback, and faced difficulties with rapport building. Participants found it hard to give real-time reactions while exercising far away from their laptops; they receive less customized instructions, and have difficulty engaging in private chats. Despite the challenges, we envision CMC in exercise is an opportunity for new design and interactions. We propose design recommendations, including using smartwatches to give real-time reactions and smart garment to generate tactile feedback. Health and biometric data can be shared with instructors and other participants during exercise for safety and to create social connections. ",

      "abstract": "Building from sociotechnical studies of disinformation and of information infrastructures, we examine how – over a period of eleven months – Italian QAnon supporters designed and maintained a distributed, multi-layered “infrastructure of disinformation” that spans multiple social media platforms, messaging apps, online forums, alternative media channels, as well as websites, databases, and content aggregators. Examining disinformation from an infrastructural lens reveals how QAnon disinformation operations extend well-beyond the use of social media and the construction of false narratives. While QAnon conspiracy theories continue to evolve and adapt, the overarching (dis)information infrastructure through which \"epistemic evidence\" is constructed and constantly updated is rather stable and has increased in size and complexity over time. Most importantly, we also found that deplatforming is a time-sensitive effort. The longer platforms wait to intervene, the harder it is to eradicate infrastructures as they develop new layers, get distributed across the Internet, and can rely on a critical mass of loyal followers. More research is needed to examine whether the key characteristics of the disinformation infrastructure that we identified extend to other disinformation infrastructures, which might include infrastructures put together by climate change denialists, vaccine skeptics, or voter fraud advocates.",

      "abstract": "Significant research has examined social media users' self-presentation strategies, both within a single account and across multiple platforms. Few studies, however, have considered how users' self-presentation varies across multiple accounts on a single platform. In this survey study, we examine how Instagram users manage content sharing decisions and the audience for their content across two types of Instagram accounts: Rinsta (\"real\" Instagram) and Finsta (\"fake\" Instagram). Data analyzed includes 499 Finsta and Rinsta posts rated across different dimensions of self-presentation (e.g., self-presentation intention, picture editing effort) and 453 open-ended responses about participants' rationales for using the two accounts. Through this mixed-method approach, we find that Rinsta accounts are more likely to be public, focus on positive and uplifting content, and involve more careful editing and selection, while Finsta accounts are used for more off-the-cuff, emotional, and inappropriate content, as well as those photos that do not make the Rinsta cut. Participants also rated how they perceived responses to their Finsta and Rinsta posts. Mediation analysis suggests that participants perceived responses to Finsta posts as less satisfying, useful, and supportive - partly because Finsta posts contained more negative emotions and received fewer comments than Rinsta posts. We discuss these findings in relation to prior work on social media, self-presentation, and platform affordances, and consider the benefits of this more time-intensive approach to managing two distinct personas on one platform.",

      "abstract": "Goal setting is critical to achieving desired changes in life. Many technologies support defining and tracking progress toward goals, but these are just some parts of the process of setting and achieving goals. People desire to set goals that are more complex than the ones supported through technology. People use goal-setting technologies longitudinally, yet the understanding of how people’s goals evolve is still limited. We draw understanding from the collaborative practices of mental health therapists and clients in how they set goals longitudinally. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 clients and 7 therapists who practiced goal setting in their therapy sessions. Based on the results, we create the Longitudinal Goal Setting Model in mental health, a three-stage model. The model describes how clients and therapists select among multiple complex problems, simplify complex problems to specific goals, and adjust goals to help people address complex issues. The findings show collaboration between clients and therapists can support transformative reflection practices that are difficult to achieve without the therapist, such as seeing problems through new perspectives, questioning and changing practices, or addressing avoided issues.

      "abstract": "Rapid technological innovations, especially in the Information Technology space, demand the workforce to be vigilant by acquiring new skills to remain relevant and employable. The workforce needs to be engaged in a continuous lifelong learning process by educating themselves about skills that will be in-demand in the future. To do so, it is important for students, job seekers, and even recruiters to know which skills will be in demand in the future to invest time and resources in these skills. On this basis, the main objective of this paper is to investigate whether social content can offer insight into potential future in-demand skills in the IT job market. Based on the analysis of social content from Reddit and Job Posting data from Dice and Monster websites, we find that social content related to job skills are strong indicators for future in demand skills. We further find that specific social content associated with recruitment-related topics are stronger indicators of future skills. Our findings encourage learners and job seekers to pay close attention to online social content to forward plan new skills and maximize their employability.",

      "abstract": "Our research in this paper lies at the intersection of collaborative and conversational search. We report on a Wizard of Oz lab study in which 27 pairs of participants collaborated on search tasks over the Slack messaging platform. To complete tasks, pairs of collaborators interacted with a so-called \\emph{searchbot} with conversational capabilities. The role of the searchbot was played by a reference librarian. It is widely accepted that conversational search systems should be able to engage in \\emph{mixed-initiative interaction}---take and relinquish control of a multi-agent conversation as appropriate. Research in discourse analysis differentiates between dialog- and task-level initiative. Taking \\emph{dialog-level} initiative involves leading a conversation for the sole purpose of establishing mutual belief between agents. Conversely, taking \\emph{task-level} initiative involves leading a conversation with the intent to influence the goals of the other agent(s). Participants in our study experienced three \\emph{searchbot conditions}, which varied based on the level of initiative the human searchbot was able to take: (1) no initiative, (2) only dialog-level initiative, and (3) both dialog- and task-level initiative. We investigate the effects of the searchbot condition on six different types of outcomes: (RQ1) perceptions of the searchbot's utility, (RQ2) perceptions of workload, (RQ3) perceptions of the collaboration, (RQ4) patterns of communication and collaboration, and perceived (RQ5) benefits and (RQ6) challenges from engaging with the searchbot.",

We propose to use the built-in camera on computers to recognize the poses of the users based on the skeletons obtained from MediaPipe APIs.",

The utility of this interaction could be adopted for exergame or rehabilitation, in which the characteristics of softness and flexibility make it safer for the child and the elder. However, previous works focus on the scenario of single users with multi-objects. Although those works can apply to multi-users, the exploration between the users is lacking for discussion. To show the feasibility, we present PressySofties, the connectable bricks for multiplayer squeeze interaction, which utilize conductive fiber and foam to detect the pressing actions and connections. With the combination of several objects with two kinds of softness, the players can perceive different prop-based haptic. Additionally, we apply to the games to explore the design consideration and possibilities for interaction design.",

By taking both prevention and entertainment into account during the epidemic, we hope to encourage the public to return to normal life and increase new travel experiences. This research develops an interactive game application that combines tourism with cultivation. We used the Internet of Things (IoT) development board and combined GPS positioning and temperature-humidity sensors to establish a wireless network connection with this application. The user's location temperature and humidity values will be sent back to the screen of the game in real time. Players can reach specific places in reality to trigger the corresponding events and then get props and upgrades. To summarize, we hope they can experience a different feeling of the game during their trip. The interaction scenario in our application, divided into two events. In the feeding event, we have three steps. In the first step, we put the smartphone on the smartphone holder, and we can start the GPS positioning after opening the application. Feeding events will be triggered when the position is near a restaurant. In the second step, after agreeing to turn on the camera, users can take pictures of foods. In the last step, users can feed the photo to the Froggy and it will stick out its tongue after touching the screen. If Froggy swallows the photo, it can increase its satiety point and level. On the other hand, in the furniture event, if user‚Äôs location is near the pond, users can get a random furniture, which can be used to decorate the Froggy's home. Finally, users will have different Froggy, and it will get a lot of furniture. As a result, we hope this application can help people go out more during the epidemic.",

In this work, we organized a mini concert and presented two songs. We attempt to provide a real-time audio-visual interaction and create a unique experience only to the moment. After the concert, we conducted a preliminary study to understand how the audience sensed the interconnection between audio and visual in this real-time performance.",

      "abstract": "There is an increasing amount of work studying fairness in socio-technical settings from a computational perspective. In this context, a variety of metrics have been introduced to measure fairness in different settings. Most of these metrics, however, do not account for the interactions between individuals or evaluate any underlying network's effect on the outcomes measured. While a wide body of work studies the organization of individuals into a network structure and how individuals access resources in networks, the impact of network structure on fairness has been largely unexplored. We introduce templates for group fairness metrics that account for network structure. More specifically, we present two types of group fairness metrics that measure distinct yet complementary forms of bias in networks. The first type of metric evaluates how access to others in the network is distributed across groups. The second type of metric evaluates how groups distribute their interactions across other groups, and hence captures inter-group biases. We find that ignoring the network can lead to spurious fairness evaluations by either not capturing imbalances in influence and reach illuminated by the first type of metric, or by overlooking interaction biases as evaluated by the second type of metric. Our empirical study illustrates these pronounced differences between network and non-network evaluations of fairness.",

      "abstract": "Financial technology (FinTech) platforms often exclude certain countries from their services due to global political conflicts. As a result, immigrants from these neglected countries struggle with transferring money to and from their homeland through formal mechanisms. Instead, they get involved in informal transnational transactions that, while flexible, are often risky and full of hassles. We looked into this issue through an online survey (n=127) and engaged with multiple stakeholders (n=16), including the Iranian immigrant community in Canada, to co-design an application called ‘Kabootar’ that matches senders and receivers of money across borders. In this application, a sender-receiver pair is matched with a pertinent pair sending money in the opposite direction. By facilitating two intra-national transactions in local currencies instead of two relatively complicated inter-national transactions, the need for money to cross borders is eliminated while staying within the boundaries of the law. Our user study (n=13) revealed several tensions in users trusting such informal transnational transactions. This work contributes to CSCW, HCI, and social computing’s growing scholarship in personalized and collaborative computing technologies by advocating for a novel design approach based on collaboration and informality and extends their scope to the domain of FinTech for politically marginalized communities.",

Most previous works focused on assessing user reliance, and more broadly trust, retrospectively, through user perceptions and task-based measures. In this work, we explore the relationship between eye gaze and reliance under varying task difficulties and AI performance levels in a spatial reasoning task. Our results show a strong positive correlation between percent gaze duration on the AI suggestion and user AI task agreement, as well as user perceived reliance. Moreover, user agency is preserved particularly when the task is easy and when AI performance is low or inconsistent. Our results also reveal nuanced differences between reliance and trust. We discuss the potential of using eye gaze to gauge human reliance on AI in real-time, enabling adaptive AI assistance for optimal human-AI team performance.",

Nascent DWeb platforms are terribly behind when it comes to the features most creators need, such as feedback metrics, monetization tools, and infrastructure that supports large audience networks. We are building a fairer platform to enable sustainable creative communities on the DWeb, while asking: What would it take to create a truly welcoming DWeb-native publishing ecosystem? Since 2019, Distributed Press and its sister project, COMPOST, have confronted this question. The Distributed Press is an open source publishing tool for the World Wide Web and DWeb. A current instance of Distributed Press runs IPFS and Hypercore nodes with HTTP gateways and automates publishing to those networks. COMPOST allows Distributed Press to do design research and live test the tool directly with stakeholders — creators and their audiences.",

Tourgether360 addresses this problem for 360 tour videos using a pseudo-spatial navigation technique that provides both an overhead “context” view of the environment as a minimap, as well as a shared pseudo-3D environment for exploring the video. Collaborators are embodied as avatars along a track depending on their position in the video timeline and can point and synchronize their playback.",

      "abstract": "Many collaborative design activities are centered around a shared artifact such as a low fidelity model of a building, or a circuit implemented on a breadboard. In such settings, collocation is extremely valuable as participants can easily infer each other’s focus of attention through peripheral awareness. These cues are often lost in traditional video conferencing systems such as Zoom. In this paper, we present an embodied remote presence system designed to support design activities that involve a physical artifact by enhancing peripheral awareness. In our system, a remote user's focus of attention is tracked by an iPhone's TruthDepth camera and rendered locally using an articulated display. Our implementation can track the wide range of head movements that occur when one switches attention between a physical artifact, a laptop, and their collaborator. To support possible discrepency between local and remote layout, head movements are remapped as robotic movements to correspond to these key elements in the local user's space. We report on the results of an evaluation characterizing the system's remapping accuracy and its ability to support peripheral awareness of a remote participant's locus of attention.",

      "abstract": "Proper calibration of human reliance on AI is fundamental to achieving complementary performance in AI-assisted human decision-making. Most previous works focused on assessing user reliance, and more broadly trust, retrospectively, through user perceptions and task-based measures. In this work, we explore the relationship between eye gaze and reliance under varying task difficulties and AI performance levels in a spatial reasoning task. Our results show a strong positive correlation between percent gaze duration on the AI suggestion and user AI task agreement, as well as user perceived reliance. Moreover, user agency is preserved particularly when the task is easy and when AI performance is low or inconsistent. Our results also reveal nuanced differences between reliance and trust. We discuss the potential of using eye gaze to gauge human reliance on AI in real-time, enabling adaptive AI assistance for optimal human-AI team performance.",

      "abstract": "Pandemic-tracking apps could be a viable mitigation technique for future pandemics worldwide, although limited adoption in many places has weakened their efficacy. It is therefore important to understand how perceptions of such apps are formed in different regions, which may contribute to adoption. We conducted a replication of prior work in the United States with participants from India (n = 416) between November 9, 2020 and January 3, 2021. We identified factors that predict perceptions of pandemic-tracking apps: social orientation, prior use of health-related technology, and demographics. We found that privacy concerns did not predict perceptions, suggesting that privacy may not be a suitable singular lens through which to study the perception of, and expectation to use, pandemic-tracking apps in India. We make several recommendations for future pandemic-preparedness campaigns and identify the need to continue the trend toward contextualizing privacy-centered research with privacy-adjacent individual factors across multiple regions.",

      "abstract": "Patient work encompasses a challenging set of activities necessary for learning about and managing chronic conditions over time. Many patient-centered health technology interventions focus on supporting types of patient work, such as symptom tracking, medication adherence, and information sharing between patients and providers. However, people may not always follow, or may actively resist, the activities prescribed by their formal patient role. In this paper, we present three case studies about patients with different chronic conditions to critically reflect on the types of patient behavior commonly taken up in health technology design as acts of “noncompliance.” Detailing conflicts that emerge when patients are caught between meeting their personal needs and following clinical best practices, we show how everyday life and health system goals are often misaligned in ways that can’t be easily reconciled through current design approaches. As a way forward, we argue for alternative ways of understanding the tensions routinely shaping people’s healthcare experiences. We introduce the term care frictions as a sensitizing concept useful for helping designers reframe “noncompliant” behaviors as legitimate forms of patient work. Our paper also offers design considerations—both on challenges and generative possibilities—for future CSCW research seeking to support a wider breadth of patient behavior. In this, we call attention to the value of designer and researcher reflexivity in making visible the problematic assumptions in health technology design that can lead to social and emotional patient harms.",

      "abstract": "While artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise for supporting healthcare providers and improving the accuracy of medical diagnoses, a lack of transparency in the composition of datasets exposes AI models to the possibility of unintentional and avoidable mistakes. In particular, public and private image datasets of dermatological conditions rarely include information on skin color. As a start towards increasing transparency, AI researchers have appropriated the use of the Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) from a measure of patient photosensitivity to a measure for estimating skin tone in algorithmic audits of computer vision applications including facial recognition and dermatology diagnosis. In order to understand the variability of estimated FST annotations on images, we compare several FST annotation methods on a diverse set of 460 images of skin conditions from both textbooks and online dermatology atlases. These methods include expert annotation by board-certified dermatologists, algorithmic annotation via the Individual Typology Angle algorithm, which is then converted to estimated FST (ITA-FST), and two crowd-sourced, dynamic consensus protocols for annotating estimated FSTs. We find the inter-rater reliability between three board-certified dermatologists is comparable to the inter-rater reliability between the board-certified dermatologists and either of the crowdsourcing methods. In contrast, we find that the ITA-FST method produces annotations that are significantly less correlated with the experts' annotations than the experts' annotations are correlated with each other. These results demonstrate that algorithms based on ITA-FST are not reliable for annotating large-scale image datasets, but human-centered, crowd-based protocols can reliably add skin type transparency to dermatology datasets. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of dynamic consensus protocols with tunable parameters including expert review that increase the visibility of crowdwork and provide guidance for future crowdsourced annotations of large image datasets.",

Independent journalists who combat disinformation in underrepresented communities have reported feeling overwhelmed because they lack the tools necessary to make sense of the information they monitor and address the data voids. In this paper, we present a system to identify and address political data voids within underrepresented communities. Armed with an interview study, indicating that the independent news media has the potential to address them, we designed an intelligent collaborative system, called Datavoidant. Datavoidant uses state-of-the-art machine learning models and introduces a novel design space to provide independent journalists with a collective understanding of data voids to facilitate generating content to cover the voids. We performed a user interface evaluation with independent news media journalists (N=22). These journalists reported that Datavoidant's features allowed them to more rapidly while easily having a sense of what was taking place in the information ecosystem to address the data voids. They also reported feeling more confident about the content they created and the unique perspectives they had proposed to cover the voids. We conclude by discussing how Datavoidant enables a new design space wherein individuals can collaborate to make sense of their information ecosystem and actively devise strategies to prevent disinformation.",

This paper presents results from a controlled experiment investigating effects related to different strategies for promoting discussion at news websites (N=336 participants).  The strategies include highlighting specific comments about a data visualization, providing prompts with the comments, and annotating prompts to the visualization. By comparison to a simple list of comments (baseline), our analysis found that annotations contributed to higher levels of participant engagement in the discussion, yet lower levels of knowledge retention related to the article.  These findings raise new considerations about whether and how to integrate discussion content into news and points toward future content moderation systems that assist in representing and eliciting discussion with design elements in news websites.",

From these, we derive three dimensions to explore in more depth: The number of capturing devices, their feature variety and the degree of automation of each feature. \r\nWe then explore the design space resulting from these three dimensions with the help of a design concept and an online survey study (N=66). Results show (1) a variety of needs and preferences justifying feature variety and multiplicity, (2) challenges in defining the right degree of manual and automatic control, and (3) the socio-technical impact of cameras in a shared space regarding privacy and ethics. We conclude with discussions on the benefits and vulnerabilities of equipping fabrication workshop with distributed camera-based capturing devices and offer opportunities for design.",

      "abstract": "In order to sustain everyday life in India during pandemic induced lockdowns, home service gig platforms materialized to provide essential services for urban society. As unemployment worsened, these gig platforms also emerged as key sources of paid work for gig workers, with some platforms promising an unusual degree of health and financial support for their gig workforce. Through semi-structured interviews, we examine how women beauty workers engaged with the infrastructural promise extended by home service gig platforms during the pandemic. While, in the context of the global south, gig platforms promoted the potential of stable income and social security, we investigate the reality behind the image. We find that various breakdowns, from miscommunication around localized travel restrictions to limited platform helpline access, introduces day-to-day unpredictability for gig workers, hindering access to paid work as well as other platform extended benefits. We suggest that home service gig platforms actually serve as ‘faux infrastructure,’ in which the privatized logics of corporate platforms work to enclose public value, while pushing the burden of access onto gig workers who must perform additional, often unpaid labors in order to fill last-mile service gaps.",

      "abstract": "Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers have long studied how technology can support collaborative care work in clinical and informal settings. We draw attention to the broader social, political, and economic conditions within which such care work and technologies for caring are embedded. The COVID-19 pandemic has made visible the exploitation of care and\ncare workers that technology can be complicit in enabling, as well as the frequently gendered and racialized nature of care work. Our paper offers an analysis of an emerging digital ecosystem in frontline health work during the COVID-19 pandemic where these dynamics become highly visible. We conducted interviews with women frontline health workers in Haryana (India) to investigate their experiences with the digitization of various aspects of their work such as data collection, coordination, training, and financial compensation. We describe the top-down transition to technology-mediated workflows, the social organization of care, and the labor politics surrounding digital workflows. We then identify four interconnected ways in which health workers attempted to build more caring futures for themselves and their communities, by focusing on survival, resilience, advocacy, and resistance. Finally, we offer these as care orientations that CSCW and HCI researchers may adopt to critically reflect on and direct technology design towards enabling more caring futures for care workers and communities.",

      "abstract": "Many collaborative design activities are centered around a shared artifact such as a low fidelity model of a building, or a circuit implemented on a breadboard. In such settings, collocation is extremely valuable as participants can easily infer each other’s focus of attention through peripheral awareness. These cues are often lost in traditional video conferencing systems such as Zoom. In this paper, we present an embodied remote presence system designed to support design activities that involve a physical artifact by enhancing peripheral awareness. In our system, a remote user's focus of attention is tracked by an iPhone's TruthDepth camera and rendered locally using an articulated display. Our implementation can track the wide range of head movements that occur when one switches attention between a physical artifact, a laptop, and their collaborator. To support possible discrepency between local and remote layout, head movements are remapped as robotic movements to correspond to these key elements in the local user's space. We report on the results of an evaluation characterizing the system's remapping accuracy and its ability to support peripheral awareness of a remote participant's locus of attention.",

      "abstract": "Introducing robots in the workplace entails new practices and configurations at the individual, organizational, and social levels. Prior work has focused on how robots may have an immediate effect on individual employees or tasks rather than their gradual influences on employees collectively or their organization over time.  By drawing on fourteen in-situ interviews with six cobot operators in a Danish manufacturing company, this paper investigates how collaborative robots (cobots) in the manufacturing context may engage broader interactions beyond the robot-operator interaction. This includes spatial configurations centering around the cobots, social interactions among employees, and information flow through, within, or outside the production cell. Introducing and implementing cobots has social dynamics at its core, which we explore in-depth. This paper argues that the design of cobots and the environment around them should accommodate the possibility of more complicated social and organizational changes brought about by these robots. Lastly, we discuss research and design implications for the future of workplaces involving robots.",

      "abstract": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses have faced unprecedented challenges when trying to remain open. Because COVID-19 spreads through aerosolized droplets, businesses were forced to distance their services; in some cases, distancing may have involved moving business services online. In this work, we explore digitization strategies used by small businesses that remained open during the pandemic, and survey/interview small businesses owners to understand preliminary challenges associated with moving online. Furthermore, we analyze payments from 400K businesses across Japan, Australia, United States, Great Britain, and Canada. Following initial government interventions, we observe (at minimum for each country) a 47% increase in digitizing businesses compared to pre-pandemic levels, with about 80% of surveyed businesses digitizing in under a week. From both our quantitative models and our surveys/interviews, we find that businesses rapidly digitized at the start of the pandemic in preparation of future uncertainty. We also conduct a case-study of initial digitization in the United States, examining finer relationships between specific government interventions, business sectors, political orientation, and resulting digitization shifts. Finally, we discuss the implications of rapid & widespread digitization for small businesses in the context of usability challenges and interpersonal interactions, while highlighting potential shifts in pre-existing social norms.",

      "abstract": "Our research in this paper lies at the intersection of collaborative and conversational search. We report on a Wizard of Oz lab study in which 27 pairs of participants collaborated on search tasks over the Slack messaging platform. To complete tasks, pairs of collaborators interacted with a so-called \\emph{searchbot} with conversational capabilities. The role of the searchbot was played by a reference librarian. It is widely accepted that conversational search systems should be able to engage in \\emph{mixed-initiative interaction}---take and relinquish control of a multi-agent conversation as appropriate. Research in discourse analysis differentiates between dialog- and task-level initiative. Taking \\emph{dialog-level} initiative involves leading a conversation for the sole purpose of establishing mutual belief between agents. Conversely, taking \\emph{task-level} initiative involves leading a conversation with the intent to influence the goals of the other agent(s). Participants in our study experienced three \\emph{searchbot conditions}, which varied based on the level of initiative the human searchbot was able to take: (1) no initiative, (2) only dialog-level initiative, and (3) both dialog- and task-level initiative. We investigate the effects of the searchbot condition on six different types of outcomes: (RQ1) perceptions of the searchbot's utility, (RQ2) perceptions of workload, (RQ3) perceptions of the collaboration, (RQ4) patterns of communication and collaboration, and perceived (RQ5) benefits and (RQ6) challenges from engaging with the searchbot.",

      "abstract": "While pandemic-tracking apps may form a future infrastructure of public health surveillance, relatively little work has systematically explored the potential humanistic implications of such an infrastructure. We conducted 23 semi-structured interviews with participants from India, the Middle East and North Africa, and the United States to engage in infrastructural speculation about the humanistic vulnerabilities that pandemic-tracking apps may create. Through interpretive analysis, we examine the relationship between persistent discomfort and vulnerability. Such examination yields three forms of vulnerability: real, anticipatory, and speculative. By identifying and defining forms of vulnerability through an analysis of people's pandemic-related thoughts and experiences, we further develop the overlapping discourses of humanistic infrastructure studies and infrastructural speculation. In doing so, we explore the temporality of vulnerability itself and present implications for the humanistic study of vulnerability in HCI and for the oversight of app-based public health surveillance.",

Participants' concerns were found to be correlated with their understanding of the app. Compared to a centralized contact tracing app, COVID Alert was favored due to its more efficient notification delivery method, its higher privacy protection level, and the personal choice to cooperate. Based on the findings, we suggest decision-makers rethink the app's privacy-utility trade-off to improve its utility by giving users more control over their data. We also suggest that technology companies build and maintain trust with the public. Further, we recommend increasing diagnosed users' motivation to notify the app and encouraging exposed users to follow the guidelines. Last, we provide design suggestions to help users with Unsound and Innocent mental models better understand the app.",

      "abstract": "Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD) are crucial for providers’ decision-making as they complement clinical data by providing a more holistic view of patients’ daily conditions. We interviewed 20 healthcare providers in asthma care to envision future technologies to support their PGHD use. We found that healthcare providers desire future AI systems to enhance their ability to treat patients by analyzing PGHD for profiling risk and predicting deterioration. Despite the benefits that AI could bring, providers perceived various challenges of AI use of PGHD, including added burden, lack of trust toward AI, and fear of being replaced by AI. Clinicians wished for a future of co-dependent human-AI collaboration, where AI will help them to improve their clinical practice. In turn, providers can improve AI systems by making AI outputs more trustworthy and humane. We discuss the importance of considering context and aligning the complex human infrastructure before designing or deploying PGHD-based AI systems in clinical settings. We point out the opportunity to design for Human-AI enrichment, where humans and AI not only partner with each other for improved performance, but also enrich each other to make each other better at work overtime.",

      "abstract": "New technologies have the potential to expand the spatial and temporal bounds of various social exchanges. It therefore becomes possible to incorporate more people and territories, and enlarge networks of cooperation of various forms for various ends. This, indeed, has been the premise of contemporary globalization: affordable, ubiquitous computing technologies to create an economy that works as a unit in real time at a planetary scale.\n  \n  Long before computing networks provided the technological infrastructure for globalization, or computer science attempted to understand cooperation, the social sciences grappled with the question of why and how people cooperate. Economists, for instance, have viewed it in terms of the emergence of a division of labour, supported by technology, to fulfill various needs. However, any narrative suggesting the frictionless incorporation of different people and territories into the global economy overlooks how social contracts, which political theorists and sociologists highlight as the basis for cooperation, can be asymmetric due to power differentials between social actors. The asymmetry is another manifestation of the socio-spatial unevenness that has historically characterized capitalism.\n  \n  The unevenness in our times has not gone unnoticed as evidenced by efforts to address the needs of those on the wrong side of the digital divide, or at the bottom-of-the-pyramid, with such initiatives as frugal innovation, or technologies for inclusive development. After a brief survey of such efforts since the turn of the millennium, the presentation will draw on ongoing research in India to describe how digital platforms mediate the last-mile delivery of services, from producers to their customers, by relying on increasing numbers of smartphone-armed gig worker ‚Äòpartners‚Äô. The presentation will argue that, as platform companies deploy technology and rely on asymmetrical contractual relationships to reconfigure the division of labour in service-delivery, workers find themselves in unequal partnerships to experience CSCW as Computer Supported Coercive Work.",

By taking both prevention and entertainment into account during the epidemic, we hope to encourage the public to return to normal life and increase new travel experiences. This research develops an interactive game application that combines tourism with cultivation. We used the Internet of Things (IoT) development board and combined GPS positioning and temperature-humidity sensors to establish a wireless network connection with this application. The user's location temperature and humidity values will be sent back to the screen of the game in real time. Players can reach specific places in reality to trigger the corresponding events and then get props and upgrades. To summarize, we hope they can experience a different feeling of the game during their trip. The interaction scenario in our application, divided into two events. In the feeding event, we have three steps. In the first step, we put the smartphone on the smartphone holder, and we can start the GPS positioning after opening the application. Feeding events will be triggered when the position is near a restaurant. In the second step, after agreeing to turn on the camera, users can take pictures of foods. In the last step, users can feed the photo to the Froggy and it will stick out its tongue after touching the screen. If Froggy swallows the photo, it can increase its satiety point and level. On the other hand, in the furniture event, if user‚Äôs location is near the pond, users can get a random furniture, which can be used to decorate the Froggy's home. Finally, users will have different Froggy, and it will get a lot of furniture. As a result, we hope this application can help people go out more during the epidemic.",

In an immersive viewing environment, we propose an interactive way to browse the virtual space with a machine learning-based pose recognition implemented in the Unity 3D game engine. No extra gaming devices, e.g. joysticks, and Kinect cameras, are needed to operate the avatar in the virtual space. We propose to use the built-in camera on computers to recognize the poses of the users based on the skeletons obtained from MediaPipe APIs.",

LiCAP is an arrayed optical pickup installed on stringed instruments to sense the vibration of the strings. It converts the audio signals into MIDI Polyphonic Expression(MPE), which enables us to create fascinating visual effects instantly through visualization software. In this work, we organized a mini concert and presented two songs. We attempt to provide a real-time audio-visual interaction and create a unique experience only to the moment. After the concert, we conducted a preliminary study to understand how the audience sensed the interconnection between audio and visual in this real-time performance.",

The utility of this interaction could be adopted for exergame or rehabilitation, in which the characteristics of softness and flexibility make it safer for the child and the elder. However, previous works focus on the scenario of single users with multi-objects. Although those works can apply to multi-users, the exploration between the users is lacking for discussion. To show the feasibility, we present PressySofties, the connectable bricks for multiplayer squeeze interaction, which utilize conductive fiber and foam to detect the pressing actions and connections. With the combination of several objects with two kinds of softness, the players can perceive different prop-based haptic. Additionally, we apply to the games to explore the design consideration and possibilities for interaction design.",
