      "abstract": "In this work we present MoDASH, a mobile DASH solution for Future Multimedia applications such as Virtual Reality (VR). We focus both on managing efficiently the available network resources as well as delivering a high Quality of Experience (QoE) to the end-users; which is achieved respectively by employing data and computational offloading techniques as well as QoE-aware resource management signaling. Our solution relies on a Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and trigger-based platform that can be used in small cell networks. This is demonstrated in the FLAME platform, where the supported monitoring of the DASH streaming and triggers allows to measure the real-time performance of the solution and dynamically adapt it to the changing conditions.",

      "abstract": "Very large floor displays can promote engaging public experiences, but incur perspective-related warping, making it challenging to comprehend and interact with distal objects when standing on the display. We introduce a perspective compensated view technique that maintains the relative size and shape of objects as they move away from the viewer, and explore the technique in SpaceHopper, a large-scale, floor-projected version of the game Asteroids. Players bounce on a hopper ball to control their ship in one of two control modes:  bounce to repel or bounce to shoot. We evaluated SpaceHopper in a field experiment with 59 participants, finding that perspective compensated view yielded longer playing times (and higher scores) in the bounce to fire modality. Bystanders were highly engaged with players and also seemed to be unaware of the perspective warping, suggesting that visually compensating for the interactor's perspective does not adversely impact the enjoyment of passive participants and audience members, at least under some circumstances.",

      "abstract": "Joint attention refers to the shared focal points of attention for occupants in a space. In this work, we introduce a computational definition of joint attention for the automated editing of meetings in multi-camera environments from the AMI corpus. Using extracted head pose and individual headset amplitude as features, we developed three editing methods: (1) a naive audio-based method that selects the camera using only the headset input, (2) a rule-based edit that selects cameras at a fixed pacing using pose data, and (3) an editing algorithm using LSTM (Long-short term memory) learned joint-attention from both pose and audio data, trained on expert edits. The methods are evaluated qualitatively against the human edit, and quantitatively in a user study with 22 participants. Results indicate that LSTM-trained joint attention produces edits that are comparable to the expert edit, offering a wider range of camera views than audio, while being more generalizable as compared to rule-based methods.",

      "abstract": "Esports (competitive videogames) have grown into a global phenomenon with over 450m viewers and a 1.5bn USD market. Esports broadcasts follow a similar structure to traditional sports. However, due to their virtual nature, a large and detailed amount data is available about in-game actions not currently accessible in traditional sport. This provides an opportunity to incorporate novel insights about complex aspects of gameplay into the audience experience – enabling more in-depth coverage for experienced viewers, and increased accessibility for newcomers. Previous research has only explored a limited range of ways data could be incorporated into esports viewing (e.g. data visualizations post-match) and only a few studies have investigated how the presentation of statistics impacts spectators’ experiences and viewing behaviors. We present Weavr, a companion app that allows audiences to consume data-driven insights during and around esports broadcasts. We report on deployments at two major tournaments, that provide ecologically valid findings about how the app's features were experienced by audiences and their impact on viewing behavior. We discuss implications for the design of second-screen apps for live esports events, and for traditional sports as similar data becomes available for them via improved tracking technologies.",

      "abstract": "This demo aims to explore and test new forms of hands-off interactivity, based more on intuitive reactions than on conscious decision-making. A hands-off interactivity would allow a diegetic experience in which the user can avoid breaking the immersion, or a “pull-back” produced by the consciousness of the interactive device. This project uses immersivity, spatial storytelling and dramatic soundscaping to facilitate navigation through simultaneous acoustic and dramatic spaces, which constitute fragments of one linear story. Driven by a dramatically-purposed stimulus users can generate inputs with organic movements around the axis of the CVR (Cinematic Virtual Reality) perspective. This way, inputs are intuitive reactions to diegetic stimuli from within the virtual narrative. The freedom to navigate the narrative space provides multiple ways to perceive the linear story, facilitating interactive storytelling.",

With this work, our goal is to draw the community's attention toward fundamentals and first principles of ARTV and to tease out its salient qualities on solid foundations.",

Likewise, the player integrates additional accessibility and assistive solutions, like voice control, visual feedback and magnification features. It is a key component of an end-to-end platform that allows augmenting traditional broadcast services with the presentation of immersive and access services content delivered via broadband. It can be also integrated in both Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) and full web-based multi-screen scenarios. Most of its supported features and personalization options are detailed in the paper, and have been adopted after validation via user-centric activities and user tests. The player is available as an online service (http://imac.i2cat.net/player/), and has been additionally integrated in the services offered by European broadcasters. Its source code is available on Github.",

In many cases, it is enough to document such objects in 2D graphics or textual descriptions. However, there are geometries and details of greater complexity that require more complete models to understand the techniques and be able to preserve them over time. In this area, the Virtual Loom tool has been created within the SILKNOW European Project. The demo that we present allows us to show weaving techniques from the 15th to the 19th century in a 3D representation and later we can explore it in different ways. The tool includes a variety of historical weaves, weaving techniques and threads. All this has been created based on the knowledge of experts in historical fabrics, art history and computer graphics.",

Through analysis of the success of past content publication, we are building cross-channel prediction models to anticipate which (type of) content will potentially be most successful on which channel at what time in the future. This can inform organizational decisions regarding which content to publish as part of an optimized content publication strategy. This includes the creation of content summaries for different channels (e.g. social media video is generally shortened to the key segments to highlight to a user of that channel) as well as the recommendation of when and where to publish those summaries to optimize reach and engagement with the audience.

      "abstract": "Live streaming is a unique medium that merges different layers of communication by facilitating individual, group, and mass communication simultaneously. Streamers who broadcast themselves on live streaming platforms such as Twitch are their own media entity and have the challenge of having to manage interactions with many different types of online audiences beyond the translucent platform interfaces. Through qualitative interviews with 25 Twitch streamers, in this paper we share streamers' practices of discovering audience composition, categorizing audience groups, and developing appropriate mechanisms to interact with them despite geographical, technological, and temporal limitations. We discuss streamers' appropriation of real-time signals provided by these platforms as sources of information, and their dependence on both technology and voluntary human labor to scale their media entity. We conclude with design recommendations for streaming platforms to provide streamer-centric tools for audience management, especially for knowledge discovery and growth management.",

      "abstract": "Watching television together in the living room is a joyful and social activity that most people can relate to. As a result of the ongoing COVID19 outbreak, many friends and family members are separated due to national lockdowns and quarantine. In this demo we show how a web application can support real-time socially based video-content by facilitating a virtual living room for friends and family where they can watch synchronized video content while interacting. Our prototype uses readily available web-technologies, allowing users to get started in just one click by logging in with their existing YouTube account. Data from the YouTube API are then fed into novel recommender algorithms that then suggest videos based on the user’s collective interests.",

      "abstract": "User-generated content platforms curate their vast repositories into thematic compilations that facilitate the discovery of high-quality material. Platforms that seek tight editorial control employ people to do this curation, but this process involves time-consuming routine tasks, such as sifting through thousands of videos. We introduce Sifter, a system that improves the curation process by combining automated techniques with a human-powered pipeline that browses, selects, and reaches an agreement on what videos to include in a compilation. We evaluated Sifter by creating 12 compilations from over 34,000 user-generated videos. Sifter was more than three times faster than dedicated curators, and its output was of comparable quality. We reflect on the challenges and opportunities introduced by Sifter to inform the design of content curation systems that need subjective human judgments of videos at scale.",

      "abstract": "  Augmented reality (AR) on smartphone devices allows people to interact\r\n  with virtually placed objects anchored in the real world through the\r\n  device's viewport. Typically, smartphone AR interactions work with\r\n  the device's 2D touchscreen disconnected from the modality and depth\r\n  of the virtual objects. In this paper, we studied 15 participants'\r\n  preferences, performances, and cognitive loads on a set of common\r\n  tasks performed on smartphones at two interaction depths\r\n  (close-range and distant) with two touchless modalities (hand\r\n  tracking and screen dwell). We find that distant AR interactions,\r\n  strongly preferred by the participants, were significantly faster\r\n  and took less cognitive effort. We observed that within both\r\n  interaction depths, modalities performed equally. When designing\r\n  touchless modalities on smartphones, we suggest using distant\r\n  interactions when overall performance is the top priority,\r\n  otherwise, using hand tracking or screen dwell as back-ups for each\r\n  other can be equally effective.",

Especially in the field of Edutainment, platforms like YouTube or TED are serious competitors and require broadcasters to come up with novel ideas to engage viewers in their program. In this work, we present the augmented reality (AR) SpaceStation application, designed to supplement the viewing of educational videos about the ISS. We evaluate users’ experience during the interaction with the app in a within-subject user study (N=31) and assessed their workload. During the interaction with the SpaceStation App, participants experienced a higher workload compared to a video-only condition; nonetheless, they considered AR a valuable and enjoyable addition. We conclude with a discussion from the perspectives of viewers, content creators, and hosts, and state initial ideas on how to design for AR in television programs without creating information overload.",

This open-ended work is often marked by uncertainty and interpretive flexibility in terms of what the product is and should be. At the same time, most current video production tools are designed for single users. There is a growing interest, both in industry and academia, to design features that support key collaborative processes in editing, such as commenting on videos. We add to current research by unpacking specific forms of collaboration, in particular the social mechanisms and strategies employed to reduce interpretive flexibility and uncertainty in achieving agreements between editors and other collaborators. The findings contribute to the emerging design interest by identifying general design paths for how to support collaboration in video editing through scaffolding, iconic referencing, and suggestive editing.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores how acoustically transparent auditory headsets can improve TV viewing by intermixing headset and TV audio, facilitating personal, private auditory enhancements and augmentations of TV content whilst minimizing occlusion of the sounds of reality. We evaluate the impact of synchronously mirroring select audio channels from the 5.1 mix (dialogue, environmental sounds, and the full mix), and selectively augmenting TV viewing with additional speech (e.g. Audio Description, Directors Commentary, and Alternate Language). For TV content, auditory headsets enable better spatialization and more immersive, enjoyable viewing; the intermixing of TV and headset audio creates unique listening experiences; and private augmentations offer new ways to (re)watch content with others. Finally, we reflect on how these headsets might facilitate more immersive augmented TV viewing experiences within reach of consumers.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Visually Induced Motion Sickness (VIMS), when the visual system detects motion that is not felt by the vestibular system, is a deterrent for first-time Virtual Reality (VR) users and can impact its adoption rate. Constricting the field-of-view (FoV) has been shown to reduce VIMS as it conceals optical flow in peripheral vision, which is more sensitive to motion. Additionally, several studies have suggested the inclusion of visual elements (e.g., grids) consistent with the real world as reference points. In this paper, we describe a novel technique dynamically controlled by a video's precomputed optical flow and participants' runtime head direction and evaluate it in a within-subjects study (N = 24) on a 360º video of a roller coaster. Furthermore, based on a detailed analysis of the video and participant's experience, we provide insights on the effectiveness of the techniques in VIMS reduction and discuss the role of optical flow in the design and evaluation of the study.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a generic (i.e. production-independent) framework for OBM storytelling. Aiming to function as a complete end-to-end (from conception to realisation) reference for authoring OBM narrative content, it proposes an integrated model that includes the three essential levels: conceptual, technological and aesthetic. At the conceptual level, we introduce a set of abstractions which provide a unified reference for thinking, describing and analysing interactive narrative structures of OBM content. Their recursive nature make our model stand out in terms of its power of expression. These abstractions have direct one-to-one operational counterparts implemented in our production-independent authoring toolkit – Cutting Room. This ensures that any specific story design within the proposed conceptual model is directly realisable as an OBM production. This isomorphic relationship between the abstract concepts and their operationalisation is another distinguishing aspect of our overall proposition. We have validated the model at the aesthetic level through the production of the interactive film What is Love?, experienced by over 900 people at the media art festival Mediale 2018 in York, UK, and evaluated through a dedicated questionnaire by 94 of them.  As the foundations of OBM storytelling have not yet been established, we trust this paper constitutes a significant milestone in its development.",

      "abstract": "Prior surveys using “typical case questions” had found people report that, typically, when they watch TV, they know in advance, exactly what they want to watch. In the current survey, conducted using “recent case questions”, people were asked to consider only their most recent TV watching experience, rather than what they think is typical for themselves. The current survey replicated the prior survey finding: most respondents reported knowing exactly what they wanted to watch on TV. The current survey also asked a series of questions to examine the effects of other factors, and found that age, content-type (e.g., series, movie, etc.) and media-type (e.g., live TV, video on demand) effected the finding. The implication of this finding for TV user experience design is that getting directly to one’s desired content is a more frequent interaction with the TV than content discovery or browsing, and thus, should have the highest priority.

We hope that this has the secondary, more serious effect, of increasing their own learning targets which is in keeping with parental expectation and the ultimate goal of educational TV programming.",

But while personal data affords many capabilities for media service enhancement, it simultaneously introduces a number of socio-technical challenges into the scheme. Concepts such as data legibility, negotiability and agency could be useful in addressing some of these challenges. Nevertheless, the contextualisation of these principles within the scope of media and exploration of design measures within this spaceremains an active challenge. This workshop aims to explore this space by bringing together media enthusiasts, designers and researchers in order to help clarify these contextualised definitions and apply them by looking into practical design responses to these challenges.",

      "abstract": "TV experiences are often social, be it at-a-distance (through text) or in-person (through speech). Mixed Reality (MR) headsets offer new opportunities to enhance social communication during TV viewing by placing social artifacts (e.g. text) anywhere the viewer wishes, rather than being constrained to a smartphone or TV display. In this paper, we use VR as a test-bed to evaluate different text locations for MR TV specifically. We introduce the concepts of wall messages, below-screen messages, and egocentric messages in addition to state-of-the-art on-screen messages(i.e., subtitles) and controller messages(i.e., reading text messages on the mobile device) to convey messages to users during TV viewing experience. Our results suggest that a) future MR systems that aim to improve viewers’ experience need to consider the integration of a communication channel that does not interfere with viewers’ primary task, that is watching TV, and b) independent of the location of text messages, users prefer to be in full control of them, especially when reading and responding to them. Our findings pave the way for further investigations towards social at-a-distance communication in Mixed Reality.",

To achieve this, we created a modular system for many-to-many live production and distribution and deployed it within the media delivery platform developed in the FLAME project.The FLAME platform provides distributed edge computing as well as a programmable network infrastructure.We have performed a first trial of our system in the instance of the FLAME platform deployed in Bristol. Our trial revealed that with our setup 93% bandwidth can be saved, and the latency can be kept as low as 3s. The user evaluation further indicated that a sufficient amount of users (45%) enjoys producing content, an important prerequisite for prosuming apps to thrive",

      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Common consumer behaviors, including watching TV broadcasts and performing daily activities, interact with one another. However, it is difficult to smoothly link broadcast and Internet services with real-world services and data. For example, when viewing interesting content on a broadcast, people often takes notes or takes pictures of a TV screen. Although they cannot easily use the viewing data and watched content at other services when taking the next action. The service provider also cannot know whether the service was used because of the broadcast. To meet this challenge, in this paper, we present how to make a smooth collaboration between broadcast and a calendar application and its effects, because it is a general application and it records various activities. We developed a calendar application that allows users to register program schedules and watch TV programs with simple operations. Based on the user evaluations, we confirmed the following results: The use of broadcast program data as schedule data has the effect of reminding the TV programs. Even for consumers with decreasing viewing time, viewing opportunities will be improved by simplifying the operation flow from a program schedule registration to broadcast viewing. Moreover, linking the schedule and history data of programs and daily activities on the calendar may promote the use of both services.",

      "abstract": "In the research project 5G-VICTORI we are looking into how fifth generation mobile network technology (5G) can help improve video streaming services for train passengers. We use the principle of a local 5G-based data link between trains and 5G base stations in railway stations to load media assets to a caching server in the train, from which passengers can stream media via the regular apps of video-on-demand (VoD) service operators. The paper gives an outlook on the challenges in delivering VoD services to trains via this type of cloud-edge platform. These include determination of relevant content for upload to the cache, enable good quality-of experience (QoE) live streaming and WiFi traffic shaping for fair allocation of network bandwidth to streaming clients.",

Thus, the development of new human-computer interfaces (HCI) techniques in these fields will be the key value for taking advantage of XR capabilities. Moreover, it is mandatory to maintain the sense of presence or immersion in the XR field. Since one of the factors of presence in XR is the embodiment, the ability to interact in XR using your own body is a current hot point in immersive HCI. However, the assessment of the Quality of Experience (QoE) in natural interaction methods remains unexplored. Therefore, the proposed research for the PhD thesis will focus on studying and evaluating the QoE of different natural interaction methods in XR.",

It is thus important to understand the psychological effects that enclosed spaces can have on people. In this study, we ran a between-subjects design experiment with people working in windowless offices by installing a digital window that featured a nature landscape video. Quantitative measures of productivity and wellbeing before and after the intervention showed that having a digital window elevated mood and happiness, but did not have a significant effect on work productivity.",

      "trackId": 10997,
      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Recently, various over-the-top (OTT) streaming services as well as traditional broadcasts distribute numerous content every day, allowing users to watch their favorite content at any time. While users can choose from a quantity of content, they often view the same content mainly because most OTT streaming services implement recommendation systems. However, it is often difficult for users to realize the same content they viewed and enjoy sharing their opinions or feelings because they do not know each other when and which content they viewed. For the purpose of encouraging such enjoyable experiences, we propose a system architecture that allows users to share the same content they viewed by using the user’s viewing history data. Such viewing history data is currently collected and stored by hundreds of different services and companies. Therefore, our system architecture adopts a user-centric data control model that allows users to collect and store their data on their own online storages, and use it for their purposes. If users are asked to disclose all of the raw data of their viewing history to each other or to third party when sharing, most of them will feel anxiety because the data often contains sensitive personal information. Therefore, we introduce a method using private set intersection (PSI), a cryptographic technique that allows users to share the same elements in the users’ viewing history data without revealing anything to each other except the elements at the intersection. We also demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture through use cases.",

      "abstract": "This paper reports on the work being done towards achieving an immersive and accessible reconstruction of Historical and Cultural Heritage, focusing on Theaters of the Early Modern as use case. In particular, the paper presents and discusses potential possibilities to enable: 1) the acoustical reconstruction of the virtual (lost) environments – beyond the graphical reconstruction for the buildings, elements and performances; 2) effective interaction features and navigation within the virtual environments (e.g. by means of adaptive interfaces, guiding methods, insertion of Point of Interest); and 3) accessible experiences, by means of an innovative and personalized presentation modes for access services, like subtitles and audio description. For most of these aspects and features, proof of concept implementation are provided and opportunities for future work are outlined. With an effective combination of all these contributions, the goal is to bring back valuable Cultural Heritage from the past, providing high benefits in relevant sectors like Culture, Tourism and Education.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "While HCI remains vastly abundant in human- and land- centric applications, in this work we focus on exploring further the Human Computer Biosphere Interaction (HCBI) concept in aquatic settings. Based on the existing techniques for prototyping the geodesic domes, we design them as five marine megafauna species, for the on- and off- shore locations. We describe novel interaction concepts with and within such structures: (i) Turtle AR nesting, (ii) Bird XR watching, (iii) Dolphin acoustic swimming, (iv) Seal night scuba-diving, and (v) Whale projection mapping. We report the design of such \"interaquatic\" environments, focused at depicting the ongoing concerns with such marina megafauna species, discussing their feasibility, suggesting research, implementation and validation for all interaquatic domes, planned in our future work.",

      "abstract": "Social VR shall allow natural communication between users with high social presence, as if users are in the same room. One way to increase social presence is to add haptic interaction to allow, for example, users to give each other a \"high-five\" or to pass documents among them. In this paper, we present our web-based VR communication framework with an added haptic component to simulate touch. The goal of this framework is to enhance the VR communication experience and the social cues exchange between users in VR. We describe our method for rendering haptic feedback within the web-based framework and evaluate the perceived quality of our system with a user survey (with 119 participants). Our proof-of-concept system was rated positively, with the haptic component offering an enhanced quality of the VR experience for 78% of the participants.",

Being watched on a diverse array of interfaces (virtual reality headsets, computers, mobile devices, etc.), user behavior needs to be analyzed for all these devices. A 360-degree hypervideo production, a virtual tour around the streets of a city, is played in an experiment by 30 users with multiple devices through a web application which collects their behavior following the Experience API standard. The distribution of viewport centers when playing these 360-degree videos is analyzed and compared between device and video types, showing an evident difference in behavior when playing videos of different type.",

If it has been so programmed you will see a life-sized virtual body replacing your own. You are likely then to have the perceptual illusion that the virtual body is yours, even though you know for sure that it is not. This is referred to as a body ownership illusion. Here I will describe this perceptual illusion, and give examples of how this has been used to address a number personal and social issues",
