      "abstract": "Live performances which involve digital technology often strive toward clear correspondences between distinct media modes, particularly those works which combine audio and video. Often, the process of creating and executing such performances involves mapping schemes which are encased within the digital system, producing content which is tightly synchronized but with relationships which can feel rigid and unexpressive. Within this paper we present a collaborative process between visualist and musician, which builds toward a method for promoting co-creativity in multimedia performance and prioritizes the performer's physical presence and interaction with digital content. Through the development of two autonomous systems, a novel physical interface and an interactive music system, we summarize our creative process of co-exploration of system capabilities, and extended periods of experimentation and exploration. From this experience, we offer an early-stage framework for approaching engaging digital audiovisual relationships in live performance settings.",

      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "This article discusses the design and implementation of the Tquencer, a tangible musical sequencer device. The tangible interaction paradigm for musical sequencers has been explored previously trough the arrangement of simple tangible tokens within time-based physical constraints. While this initial approach allows for the creation of basic rhythmic or melodic loops, it sometimes lacks the musical depth required for professional live performance. Therefore we introduce several additional physical design elements that allow the development of musical complexity, while maintaining the overall simplicity of tangible interaction. These tangible elements include single-step, multi-step and resizable tokens, which can be arranged to trigger musical events, multi-step sound effects and more complex sequence patterns. Furthermore the device also allows the dynamic assignment of the content and behavior of physical tokens through dedicated configuration tokens. We also introduce tangible overlays, which allow the handling and arrangement of multiple musical configurations in various layers. This token configuration and layer management is facilitated by an additional control step, which allows for the overall tangible configuration of a musical setup. Apart from its primary musical application scenario, the Tquencer also provides a generic tangible controller platform for time-based sequencing applications.",

Two sets of EMS pads are positioned on the painter’s arm such that stimulation pulses, triggered on a collocated tablet interface by audience members, cause deviation in the ongoing brushstroke. LEDs co-located with the EMS pads provide additional visual feedback to the audience of stimulation delivery. In an initial trial, rather than focusing on co-creation, the audience amused themselves by mischievously diverting the painter from his work.",

      "abstract": "Human hair is a cultural material, with a rich history displaying individuality, cultural expression and group identity. It is malleable in length, color and style, highly visible, and embedded in a range of personal and group interactions. As wearable technologies move ever closer to the body, and embodied interactions become more common and desirable, hair presents a unique and little-explored site for novel interactions. In this paper, we present an exploration and working prototype of hair as a site for novel interaction, leveraging its position as something both public and private, social and personal, malleable and permanent. We develop applications and interactions around this new material in HäirIÖ: a novel integration of hair-based technologies and braids that combine capacitive touch input and dynamic output through color and shape change. Finally, we evaluate this hair-based interactive technology with users, including the integration of HäirIÖ within the landscape of existing wearable and mobile technologies. ",

      "abstract": "We introduce the term Digital Dresses as Dynamic Displays as an emergent field in the domains of Wearable Computing and Embodied Interactions. This recent approach consists of turning clothing into visual - and sometimes audiovisual - displays to enable novel forms of interaction between the wearer, the viewer, the tangible clothing and the embedded content. In this context, we present Enchanted Wearable, a new optimized low cost approach to create Digital Dresses as Dynamic Displays. Enchanted Wearable is a technologically embellished and augmented garment containing a portable rear dome projection system that transforms the clothing fabric into a blank canvas displaying audiovisual content. With this system, we create a new form of expression through clothing to reflect identity, personality, emotions and inner states of the wearer. In this paper we first present the growing field of Digital Dresses as Dynamic Displays, then we survey and analyse existing prior art in this field using a specific list of characteristics: display technology, wearability, interactivity, brightness, context. Finally we present the design and technology behind our new Enchanted Wearable system and explain how it brings new perspectives to the field.",

      "abstract": "We present zPatch: an eTextile patch for hover, touch, and pressure input, using both resistive and capacitive sensing. zPatches are made by layering a piezo-resistive material between silver-plated Ripstop, and embedding it in non-conductive fabric to form a patch. zPatches can be easily ironed onto most fabrics, in any location, enabling easy prototyping or ad hoc-modifications of existing garments. We provide open-source resources for building and programming zPatches and present measures of the achievable sensing resolution of a zPatch. A pressure based targeting task demonstrated users could reliably hit pressure targets at up to 13 levels, given appropriate feedback. We demonstrate that the hybrid sensing approach reduces false activations and helps distinguish between gestures. Finally, we present example applications in which we use zPatches for controlling a music player, text entry and gaming input.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, architects and designers have used scale models to explore, communicate, and evaluate concepts and ideas in large-scale, spatial projects. These scale models offer the user a bird's eye perspective and often tangible ways of interacting with the model. Nevertheless, they lack a realistic, first-person view on the effects that the design solutions have in the space. In this paper, we explore MacroScope, a tool that aims to support collaborative spatial design by providing a real time, 360 degree first-person perspective in a physical scale model, by means of a virtual reality head-mounted display.\r\nWe reflect on the usage potentials in collaborative creative processes, before describing next steps for the development of MacroScope.",

      "abstract": " Objektivisering is an experimental system for the computational modeling of generative 3D-printable models. The system pivots on Natural Language Understanding technologies and big 3D data. It processes arbitrary text input, eventually generating an array of words and phrases that summarise its meaning. These are then used as queries to retrieve 3D data from Thingiverse. Finally, the resulting bag of models is concatenated, in this way producing original 3D-printable designs in a computational fashion. Albeit being concretely physical, the resulting artefacts also incorporate the cybernetic encodings of their own making. In this way, they celebrate a certain kind of objecthood which is hybrid, post-digital, and self-introspective at a structural level, in this way concretely accelerating materialist aesthetics.",

      "abstract": "The use of armatures is a convenient way of deforming and animating 3D digital models. However, interact with an armature is usually time-consuming, and often requires professional skills. Tangible interfaces, such as building blocks, while having improved the accessibility of digital construction, are still lacking in flexibility and present difficulties in dealing with curved armatures. This paper introduces TwistBlocks, a pluggable and twistable modular TUI that improves the accessibility of 3D modeling and animating by physical armature interaction. TwistBlocks is capable of creating complex armatures with dense branches, and supports a high DOF (Degree of Freedom) in physical manipulation. In addition, a set of software tools are provided for novice users to easily create, rig, and animate models. The global-posture sensing network sensing scheme can also measure the rotation and movement of the physical armature, and enables interaction between multiple models. ",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an analytical approach that we call the focus framework. The framework aids the analysis of the intended and unintended design attributes that emerge within a project’s design process. The framework helps to reveal how prototypes and decision making interact together to shape the final design features and make visible the trajectory of central design attributes and unexplored alternatives. In this paper, we report on the framework and its development by way of a retrospective analysis of a tangible light installation we designed known as the Urban Data Posts. We see the potential for designers to use the focus framework as a post-mortem tool to retrospectively analyze their own work and thus inform their design practice. The knowledge gained through the analysis can then be applied in future projects more generatively.",

      "abstract": "We present CRISPEE, a novel tangible user interface designed to engage young elementary school children in bioengineering concepts. Using CRISPEE, children assume the role of a bioengineer to create a genetic program that codes for a firefly's bioluminescent light. This is accomplished through sequencing tangible representations of BioBricks,  which code for the primary colors of light (red, green, and blue) to be turned on or off. The interface and curricular supplement expose children in early elementary school to concepts traditionally taught much later in school curricula through playful interaction and exploration. We discuss CRISPEE's concept and design, and share findings from its preliminary evaluation with children and adults.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic elements of traditional drawing processes such as the order of compilation, and speed, length, and pressure of strokes can be as important as the final art piece because they can reveal the technique, process, and emotions of the artist. In this paper, we present an interactive system that unobtrusively tracks the freehand drawing process (movement and pressure of artist's pencil) on a regular easel. The system outputs captured information using 2D video renderings and 3D-printed sculptures. We also present a summery of findings from a user study with 6 experienced artists who created multiple pencil drawings using our system. The resulting digital and physical outputs from our system revealed vast differences in drawing speeds, styles, and techniques. At TEI art track, the attendees will likely engage in lively discussion around the analog, digital, and tangible aspects of our exhibit. We believe that such a discussion will be critical not only in shaping the future of our work, but also in understanding novel research directions at the intersection of art and computation.",

Recently,\r\nnew tactile technology has been developed: the mid-air de-\r\nvices, capable of delivering tactile feedback without entering\r\nin contact with the skin. One of the contributions of the doc-\r\ntoral research described in this paper is to overcome design\r\nchallenges and create immersive experiences by applying psy-\r\nchological principles and paradigms, exploiting the advantages\r\nof the mid-air technology. We designed possible embodied\r\ninteraction scenarios in mid-air and physical touch. Findings\r\nfrom these research point to opportunities for designing new\r\nimmersive experiences.

We tested the card set in a dedicated workshop, observing that participants were able to explore most of the tangible and IoT properties. To complement the IoT card set, a hardware prototyping toolkit with examples for each of the 8 tangible properties is currently under development.",

      "abstract": "Metacognitive awareness enables people to make conscious decisions about their own cognitions, and adapt to meet task performance goals. Despite the role of metacognition in task performance, technologies that effectively augment metacognition are scarce. We explore a novel approach to augment metacognition based on making the eye’s pupil dilations, which associate with a variety of cognitions, audible via sonification in real-time. In this exploratory study, we investigated whether pupil dilation sonification can elicit metacognitive awareness. Our findings suggest that correlations between a variety of cognitions, e.g., attentional focus and depth of thinking, and sounds generated by the sonification can emerge spontaneously and by instruction. This justifies further research into the use of pupil dilation sonification as a means to augment metacognitive abilities.",

      "abstract": "Current food consumption patterns are unsustainable. They are a result of the influence of politics, economics and sociocultural constructs. Food is an everyday mundane that we need to decide on three or four times in a day. This decision rather than building on an informed choice is built on the complexity of demand and supply, governed by the principles of industrial revolution. In a post digital, “post food” scenario, we propose a fictional technology called ‘Essen’. ‘Essen’ has the capacity to sustain a human being without the need to eat food. In presenting it, our aim is to question the trajectories of food through design fiction to understand current food practices better and to broaden our thinking on sustainable food futures.",

      "abstract": "In order to contribute to a design for future airline cockpits that can address the limitations of touch-based interfaces, we analyze tangible dimensions of cockpit activity based on observations and pilot interviews. Working from these data, using TEI theory and concepts of phenomenology, we discuss the implications for tangible design of our findings. We found that the status of sensation in perception, the required level of control in actions, the safety issues using physical objects and the restricted mode of externalization, raise challenges for tangible design. Accordingly, we discuss key concepts for the design of the future cockpit, such as the use of a protected space where interaction may involve compressed externalization, rhythmic structures and customized context-aware adaptations.",

The crafting of the game elements and the game experience are described in detail, as well as the technological implementation. Insights from initial trials are described, showing that children and adults perceived the game in different ways.

It is a tangible device that can detect and project colors, allowing therapists to “magnify” those colors and creating a vast variety of playful interactions for and with children suffering from low vision. The exploration of the design domain and the iterative development of The Cuebe were driven by a co-design approach involving four therapists and 12 affected children.

We present an interactive performance installation and demonstrate how concepts from early years practice, in particular schemas, children’s repeated play patterns, can be used as a design framework. We integrated sensors and microcontrollers into objects, puppets, and scenography and invited eight groups of very young children and their grownups to explore the performance. We discuss how schemas are useful as a design and analysis tool in TEY, how schemas need to be expanded to include multi-sensory interactions with hybrid physical-digital objects, and how designers need to consider the roles of adults who scaffold interaction between very young children and their surroundings.",

In this study, we investigate techniques to construct touch interfaces using a multilayered electronic circuit (urushi circuit). At first, we fabricated an urushi circuit with a touch electrode consisting of two layers. To improve its appearance, we fabricated urushi circuits in which all touch electrodes are arranged on the top layer and all wires are hidden in the bottom layer. Moreover, as an extension of the touch interface, we built a grid of touch electrodes that realizes two-dimensional touch sensing.",

In this paper, we explore the design space around movement as a form of gestural communication for information output, in simple actuated desktop devices. We were curious as to how people might envision interacting with autonomous technology in the office. Accordingly, we focused our attentions on one prevalent desktop object, an interactive lamp, with three actuated joints, which allowed us to explore the interaction space of such devices. We invited 13 participants to design and enact movements with the lamp to communicate 20 simple messages. We explored a subset of these generated gestures, using the lamp as a personal cueing device in an office setting with 14 new participants. We present our qualitative findings from both studies that let users imagine the usage of an interactive desktop lamp through actuation.",

The challenge for designers is to develop new products that use these new techniques, that improve the experience of the user. We designed ICOS; a Smart, Interactive and Adaptive clothing rack, which presents the advantages of machine learning when implemented in our daily lives. The machine learning was developed and implemented within a clothing rack that uses weather data (type of weather and temperature) and frequency of the previous selected clothes to advise the user. This is to improve and enrich the daily routine of picking clothes of users. ",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in technology and miniaturization allow the building of self-levitating tangible interfaces. This includes flying tangibles, which extend the mid-air interaction space from 2D to 3D. While a number of theoretical concepts about interaction with levitating tangibles were previously investigated by various researchers, a user-centered evaluation of the presented interaction modalities has attracted only minor attention from prior research. We present Flyables, a system adjusting flying tangibles in 3D space to enable interaction between users and levitating tangibles. Interaction concepts were evaluated in a user study(N=17), using quadcopters as operable levitating tangibles. Three different interaction modalities are evaluated to collect quantitative data and qualitative feedback. Our findings show preferred user interaction modalities using Flyables. We conclude our work with a discussion and future research within the domain of human-drone interaction.",

The addition of ubiquitous surveillance is an intrusion on privacy and does not take real-time actions. The cold, lifeless light shines in the darkness, trapping people in the solitude of silence. These absences motivated us to create Twinkle - a luminous transformative creature inhabits on light posts. They are curious aerial animals attracted by human activities. During daytime, they rest on urban light posts, expanding their solar panels for charging. At night, they interact with individuals walking on the street in their own way based on their distinct personalities. Twinkles are indirect solutions for improving urban safety without surveillance. We envisage a future that appliance goes beyond machine and becomes a companion with us.",

We argue that current sensory experiences designed for VR often lack a broader consideration of the senses, especially in their neglect of the non-digital. We discuss some implications of non-digital design for sensory VR, suggesting that there may be opportunities to expand conceptions of what sensory design in VR can be.",

      "abstract": "In September 1966, the festival and congress Visioner av Nuet (“Visions of the Present”) took place in Stockholm. The event aimed to investigate the impact of technology on humanity, society and art. Computing was only in its infancy, yet discussing its consequences and exploring what it would mean to make use of it artistically was considered paramount at that time. Almost half a century later, artist Anna Lundh began a research effort into the 1966 festival and produced an updated version, to reconsider its original concerns in a world fully immersed in the technology that in 1966 was called “the new”. Lundh’s festival, Visions of the Now, took place in May 2013 and gathered over thirty international artists, musicians, theorists and scientists, in a series of lectures, panels, open discussions, art and music performances. This artistic experiment has also been documented in a multi-volume archive box, recently published by Sternberg Press. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nAnna Lundh is an artist and PhD candidate in the KTD program (Konstfack/Royal Institute of Technology). Lundh’s work investigates cultural phenomena, societal agreements, and how ideological shifts take place, often taking technology and our experience of time as points of departure. This transdisciplinary practice includes video, installation, web-based work, interactive experiments, text and performance. Her work has been exhibited in Sweden at Moderna Museet, Bonniers Konsthall, Tensta Konsthall, and GIBCA; and internationally in Norway, Holland, Denmark, Latvia and the US – primarily in New York City art organizations including The New Museum, The Kitchen, ExitArt, Apexart, and Performa.",

      "abstract": "The accurate recognition of guitarist performance is challenging compared with other instruments because a guitar player typically plays several notes at once and uses both hands in different ways. In this paper, we propose a sensor-based guitar that consists of two groups of sensors. One sensor is used to recognize the fingering positions of the fretting hand, and the other is used to detect the guitar strings that are played by the picking hand. We design an embedded system for accurate sensing and propose a data analysis mechanism to precisely figure out the played pitch and the duration of notes using the sensed data. We realize our scheme as a high-quality prototype that detects guitarist performance with accuracy sufficient for the transcribing of a performance. We also present real application examples such as a rhythm game for interactive lessons and a music sharing feature with user created musical scores.",

      "abstract": "A new approach to interaction design that moves beyond representation and metaphor to focus on the material manifestations of interaction. Smart watches, smart cars, the Internet of things, 3D printing: all signal a trend toward combining digital and analog materials in design. Interaction with these new hybrid forms is increasingly mediated through physical materials, and therefore interaction design is increasingly a material concern. In this book, Mikael Wiberg describes the shift in interaction design toward material interactions. He argues that the \"material turn\" in human-computer interaction has moved beyond a representation-driven paradigm, and he proposes \"material-centered interaction design\" as a new approach to interaction design and its materials. He calls for interaction design to abandon its narrow focus on what the computer can do and embrace a broader view of interaction design as a practice of imagining and designing interaction through material manifestations. A material-centered approach to interaction design enables a fundamental design method for working across digital, physical, and even immaterial materials in interaction design projects. Wiberg looks at the history of material configurations in computing and traces the shift from metaphors in the design of graphical user interfaces to materiality in tangible user interfaces. He examines interaction through a material lens; suggests a new method and foundation for interaction design that accepts the digital as a design material and focuses on interaction itself as the form being designed; considers design across substrates; introduces the idea of \"interactive compositions\"; and argues that the focus on materiality transcends any distinction between the physical and digital.",

      "abstract": "Interfaces that subvert, substitute, or augment the relationship between acting and sensing make interesting tools for experimentation in artistic research. Amongst them, tactile vision interfaces, which enable people to experience to “see with their skin”, have particular appeal. However, surprisingly few such interfaces are used by artists. In the present work we take a first look at how the artistic potential of tactile vision interfaces could be unlocked. On the basis of related artistic work, we argue that an accessible, generalizable and learnable interface is needed to enable artists to explore the possibilities of tactile vision. Subsequently, we present ongoing research that revolves around the development of such a tactile vision interface. A case study is presented that informs the development of a new prototype of this interface that overcomes two key limitations in its purpose to unlock the artistic potential of tactile vision.",

      "abstract": "Social learning curricula teach children social norms for managing conversations, such as the norm of not overlapping in talking turns. Interactive tangible objects (briefly, tangibles) can help teachers in the scaffolding of such norms. Such tangibles should be created for the specific social learning contexts of their users, and evolve according to their requirements. An ideal design process for tangibles for children's conversations is meta-design, based on action-research: evolving tangible prototypes are developed, with natural material and easy-to-use micro-electronics components; tangibles are adopted by their users in ecological studies, and their usage is reflected over with designers to stir design directions or uncover design possibilities, which are developed and again used by users. This paper reports on such an evolutionary design process, concerning tangibles for children's conversations. It shows how new design ideas emerged by making users adopt design solutions and moving designers into ecological settings.",

However, these narratives are rarely captured by the game and instead rely on the player to memorize and retell them. In response to this, we designed Loominary, a game platform that plays Twine games using a rigid heddle table-top loom as a controller. Not only does this provide a new method of interacting with a game, but also records each of the player’s choices into a tangible object that is created by interacting with the game. Loominary is a working prototype and in this paper, we discuss the design considerations and areas for improvement.",

      "abstract": "We introduce and discuss the design and use of new tools for electronic textile making. Electronic textiles, or eTextiles, are increasingly produced and used in experimental interfaces, wearables, interior design, as well as in the education and maker cultures. However, the field relies on tools specific to either the textile or the electronic domain, neglecting the distinct requirements, and potentials, of their intersection. To address this gap, we explored the design of new tools, targeted at specific needs and use cases of electronic textile making and the materials used. Three resulting prototypes have been evaluated through use in both our own practice and among a group of experts in the field. Our findings show the importance of specialized tools for routines essential to the field eTextiles, their role for the emergence of new practices, as well as for the understanding of the discipline.

Our report entails a detailed description of a co-design process involving early intervention specialists and affected children over the course of six months and multiple prototype iterations.

Whilst effective rehabilitation exercises can help recover and maintain some affected motor function, stroke survivors often do not carry out enough of these. Instead relying on their `good' side to carry out tasks. However, this leads to poor recovery limiting the ability to carry out everyday bimanual tasks (such as dressing or cooking). We present work that seeks to support stroke survivors to engage in bimanual rehabilitation through interaction with augmented tangible objects that can be used to control everyday devices. Through a user-centered design process, we uncovered how bimanual rehabilitation can be supported. This led to the development of the ActivSticks device that allows bimanual rehabilitation and interaction with other devices and services.",

Although haptic properties are emphasized, TUIs are presented in and perceived through multiple modalities. Especially visual properties like color shape the users’ expectations about the relation between tangibles and the abstract data they represent and control. Viewing TUIs as multisensory percepts, we present an empirical study that quantifies benefits of an explicit design for color for intuitive interaction. In a cross-cultural experiment, 75 participants (Germans and Japanese) matched tangible objects of different colors, sizes, weights or temperatures with abstract words. The results indicate that multimodal representations increase the efficiency, effectiveness and user satisfaction, but only if colors and haptic properties evoke congruent associations. Incongruently designed tangibles led to a 17% increase in response speed, -28% lower accuracy and -61% lower preference ratings compared to congruently designed tangibles. ",

      "abstract": "Connected lighting solutions are replacing traditional lightbulbs in the home environment and offer unlimited numbers of light settings, varying in color, brightness, saturation and more. Interaction design for such systems is challenging: simple switches no longer suffice, and asking users to specify all parameters of all lightbulbs separately is time-consuming and requires them to understand the desired outcome. This paper presents Plux, a tangible light controller which employs a hybrid control approach. Plux generates light settings of pseudo-randomized color palettes, while users control the saturation and brightness directly. Plux is intended to enable serendipitous exploration of new light settings using a peripheral interaction design approach. A field deployment in which 5 people used Plux for 3 weeks in their homes revealed that using Plux easily became a part of the everyday routine. Plux’s hybrid control approach was particularly valuable for users who struggle to determine the desired light setting.",

      "abstract": "Level editors let end-users create custom levels and content within a given video game. In this paper, we explore the concept and design of Augmented reality game level editors. These new types of editors are not only spatial and embodied, but also situated, as they enable users to tailor games to the unique characteristics and emotional value of their own space.\r\n\r\nWe present the design and implementation of a prototype level editor that runs on the Microsoft HoloLens. The editor enables users to add virtual content in their homes and add interactions through spatial trigger-action game-logic programming. We had pairs of students create games with the prototype and play each other's games. They reported that games are fun to make, play, and watch others play. Based on the design and evaluation, we propose guidelines for Augmented reality game-authoring tools for end users.",

The project forms a basis for the exploration of an ethical dimension to interactions in virtual reality. This publication focuses on identifying qualities of embodied sense-making in an existing physical space, the interactive exhibition Charged Utopia. These qualities are transposed into a virtual interactive space. The translation of the qualities is done through the three main themes: Physical Movement, Resistance and Ambiguity. We present the design research process to describe how these themes were identified and transposed. We conclude with reflections that sketch ways in which we might capitalise on the opportunities offered by a virtual space, while respecting human skills in embodied sensemaking.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on manual screenprinting as a DIY fabrication technique for embedding interactive behavior onto a rage of substrates such as paper, fabric, plastic, wood, or vinyl. We frame screenprinting as a process that operates at the intersection of art, technology, and material science and iteratively examine its potential in two STEAM contexts. We conducted youth and adult workshops whereby participants worked with our low-cost thermochromic, UV-sensitive, and conductive screenprinting inks to develop a range of concepts and final projects. Our findings highlight several unique features of screenprinting: it affords a low barrier to entry for smart material fabrication, supports a collaborative maker practice, and scaffolds creative engagement with STEAM concepts. By being widely-accessible and substrate-agnostic, screenprinting presents exciting opportunities for TEI: DIY fabrication of smart materials in domains such as fine arts, information visualization, and slow technology; and bridging diverse disciplines through STEAM screenprinting initiatives at youth and adult levels.",

      "abstract": "During collocated meetings, the spontaneous need for information, called opportunistic search, might arise while conversing. However, using smartphones to look up information might be disruptive, disrespectful or even embarrassing in social contexts. We propose an alternative instrument for this practice: Glance Mug, a touch-sensitive mug prototype that listens to the conversation and displays browsable content-driven results on its inner screen. We organized 15 pairs of one-to-one meetings between students to gather user reflections. The user study revealed that the mug has the potential for supporting instant search and affords sufficient subtlety to conceal user actions. Yet, it provoked some anxiety for the users in maintaining eye contact with their partners. Our main contributions are the context-aware mug concept tested in a real-life setting and the analysis through Hornecker and Buur’s Tangible Interaction Framework that discusses its design space, and its impact on the users and social interaction.",

      "abstract": "“You Better Eat to Survive” is a two-player virtual reality game that involves eating real food to survive and ultimately escape from a virtual island. We sense eating actions of players by analyzing chewing sounds captured by a low-cost microphone attached to the players’ cheek. Our interest in using cooperative eating as a way of interacting in virtual reality is driven by the possibilities of creating a cross-modal gameplay experience that benefits social interactions. A user study with 22 players showed that eating real food improved players’ feeling of presence, challenged trust dependencies and made the survival aspect of the game feel more “real”. We use these insights to articulate three design themes that can guide designers in creating virtual reality games that incorporate cooperative eating. Ultimately, our work aims to guide design thinking towards using underexplored interaction methods in virtual reality games, thereby reiterating the post-digital design theme of TEI 2018.",

      "abstract": "Various forms of wearable robotics challenge the notion of the human body, in that the robots render the acquired capabilities in physical forms. However, majority of such systems are designed for specific purposes, where rapidly changing environments pose a diverse set of problems that are difficult to solve with a single interface. To address this, we propose a modular hardware platform that allows its users or designers to build and customize wearable robots. The process of building an augmentation is simply to connect actuator and sensor blocks and attach to the body. The current list of designed components includes servomotor modules and sensor modules, which can be programmed to incorporate additional electronics for desired sensing capabilities. Our electrical and mechanical connector designs can be extended to utilize any motors within afforded power, size, and weight constraints. We also show how our platform can be used in various applications, in addition to how the proposed design enables designers, and potentially machines, to generate alternative designs.",

An expert review and a field evaluation with eight secondary school teachers were conducted to explore potential values of such a system and gather user experiences. Results revealed rich insights into how the system could influence teaching and learning, as well as how a distributed display can be seamlessly integrated into teachers’ routines.",

In the 1980s, researchers devised an algorithm for generating computer graphics from medical scan data that featured an underlying language of faceted cubes. Marching Cubes Made Tangible translates this virtual procedure into interactive installations, which are assembled from a modular set of 3D printed components. By enacting the algorithm in the real world, this project generates dialogue about the ways in which information technologies create the building blocks of contemporary culture.",

MOD is intended for live performance and content creation efforts that mix common analog drawing interfaces (i.e. paper, transparency, pencil, marker) with digital cameras (webcams, scientific imaging cameras, digital magnifiers and microscopes), custom software (for keying, thresholding, looping, layer) and digital projectors. The iteration of the instrument described here combines all of these components into a single portable battery powered pack- age that embeds the computation on a small linux computer, includes a small laser projector, and integrates custom tac- tile controllers. The intended uses of this instrument include experimental performance and rapid content creation; the instrument is intended to be suitable for formal (concert hall, theater) and informal (street performance, busking, parade, protest) settings, classrooms and maker spaces.",

Body-worn cameras currently lack suitable design strategies for privacy notices that announce themselves and their actions to \\textit{secondary} and \\textit{incidental} users, such as bystanders, when they are being used in public. Hypothesizing that the commonly used status LED is not optimal for this use case, due to being not sufficiently understandable, noticeable, secure and trustworthy, we explore design requirements of privacy notices for body-worn cameras. Following a two-step approach, we contribute incentives for design alternatives to status LEDs: Starting from 8 design sessions with experts, we discuss 8 physical design artifacts, as well as design strategies and key motives. Finally, we derive design recommendations of the proposed solutions, which we back based on an evaluation with 12 UX \\& HCI experts.",

      "abstract": "Research on tangible user interfaces commonly focuses on tangible interfaces acting alone or in comparison with multi-touch or graphical interfaces. In contrast, hybrid approaches can be seen as the norm for established “mainstream” interaction paradigms. This paper proposes interfaces that support complementary use of physical and virtual interaction modalities with tangible and multi-touch interactions. We describe prototypes involving capacitively-sensed surfaces combined with laser-cut and 3D-printed dial-like tangibles. We employ them in the context of several computationally-mediated scientific poster scenarios, which we argue to have a number of attractions for such deployments. We present two platforms: one templated, the other highly customizable, supporting both tangible and multi-touch interactions across horizontal and vertical displays. We explore users’ interaction modality choice among the options presented, draw lessons and challenges from posters developed by students, and consider future directions. ",

Many devices are built to perceive physical phenomena and react to certain stimuli. The Screaming Sun is an analogue noise-making instrument that experiments with light as a stimulus. It is a solar-powered interactive artifact that is meant to be played with and explored. The instrument, much like a living being, thrives on light.

Our project aims to support students' understanding of the multi-faceted nature of bovine laminitis, through the use of an interactive book interface. We implemented the unique approach of using paper circuitry to create the electrical pathway from an actual book to the computer. Book pages with embedded paper circuitry become an interactive surface, that visualizes a progression of bovine laminitis through its stages of disease. Future development of the work will include developing content from other disciplines for the same platform.",

Then, we elaborate the augmentations provided by the MR system in the three primary phases of a construction kit's lifecycle: Creation, Tweaking, and Usage. Finally, we demonstrate Ani-Bot with four application examples and evaluate the system with a two-session user study. The results of our evaluation indicate that Ani-Bot does successfully embed MRI into the lifecycle (Creation, Tweaking, Usage) of DIY robotics and that it does show strong potential for delivering an enhanced user experience.

Age-related impairments and disabilities can further complicate or deny the use of conventional computers. To remove existing barriers, we created a series of tailor-made computers, which met specific needs like improved accessibility or particular aesthetics. To accomplish this, we used a co-design toolkit that we created (a) to provide senior users with early tangible experiences of their future systems and (b) to iteratively convert it into the final implementation.

      "abstract": "Research in smart textiles and garments has mostly focused on integrating sensing technology. In order to make garments that are truly interactive it is also essential to develop technologies for actuating smart garments and textiles. This paper introduces ShapeTex, a thermal shape changing fabric that uses laminate thermal expansion to actuate textiles. We present the design process and rationale for ShapeTex; we explain the fabrication process we have developed for making ShapeTex accessible to fashion designers and interaction designers. Based on co-creation sessions with designers we discuss requirements derived from this material. Finally we present a number of concept prototypes created to explore and illustrate the potential applications of ShapeTex. ",

The prototype senses small movements and shifts in posture using a Kinect sensor, and maps these movements to the tilting of a platform holding a set of marbles, and to haptic feedback in the form of vibrations. The prototype provides an interactive experience focusing on building body awareness with a particular focus on balance and posture. The design inquiry provided new insights with respect to reinforcement of bodily experiences and how different modalities affect the guiding of attention.",

      "abstract": "Opto-Phono-Kinesia (OPK) is an audio-visual performance piece in which all media elements are controlled by the body movements of a single performer. The title is a play on a possible synesthetic state involving connections between vision, sound and body motion. Theoretically, for a person who experiences this state, a specific colour could trigger both a sound and a body action. This synesthetic intersection is simulated in OPK by simultaneity of body movement, and audio-visual result.\r\n\r\nUsing the Gesture and Media System 3.0 motion-tracking system, the performer can dynamically manipulate an immersive environment using two small infrared trackers. The project employs a multipart interface design based on a formal model of increasing complexity in visual-sound-body mapping, and is therefore best performed by an expert performer with strong spatial memory and advanced musical ability. OPK utilizes the “body as experience, instrument and interface” [1] for control of a large-scale environment.\r\n\r\n1.\tACM. TEI Arts Track website. 2017.

DNNs are not yet a standard part of fashion de- sign practice, either clothes patterns or prototyping tools. In this paper, we present DeepWear, a method using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks for clothes design. The DNNs learn the feature of specific brand clothes and generate images then patterns instructed from the images are made, and an author creates clothes based on that. We evaluated this system by evaluating the credibility of the actual sold clothes on market with our clothes. As the result, we found it is possible to make clothes look like actual products from the generated images. Our findings have implications for collaborative design between machine and human intelligence.",

      "abstract": "Recent work in tangible interfaces, including widget sets like .NET Gadgeteer and Phidgets, has enabled prototyping of rich physical interaction at a handheld or tabletop scale. But it remains unclear how participants respond to physical widgets at larger scales. What kinds of interaction would larger widgets enable, and what kinds of systems - if any -\r\n can or should be built with them? We built unusually-sized widgets, or \"mega-widgets\" in order to explore this territory. We present the results of two iterations of building mega-widgets and accompanying user studies designed to help understand participants' reactions to mega-widgets and probe possible applications. Responses indicated, among other things, a correlation between widget size and the perceived size or importance of what it might control. Mega-widgets were also perceived as increasing the precision of user input control and providing a fun and playful element. We hope that knowledge gained from this exploratory work can help lay groundwork for further exploration of widgets at larger scales.",

The game controller will allow for audience interception and participation--they will be able to change the rules of how the game is played (for example, making players place their right hand on any red circle) which will increase the difficulty of the game. Our hope is to have this board in popular and busy spaces such as campus centers. Our goal with this surface is to create an interface that will help foster engagement in communities.  ",

      "abstract": "Human material interaction is embedded in an experience-based embodied context, which is difficult to verbalize and abstract. However, new computational composites are often\r\nconducted and presented in a laboratory setting absent from human embodied involvement. This research project aims at exploring the link between textile shape change and material memory through an embodied approach. This is done by incorporating a performative collective of dancers and artists into the development process of a shape changing textile membrane, while at the same time collecting and analyzing data of the process. It is expected that out of the rich insight gained a new perspective on the relationship between memory, material, movement and body emerges.",

      "abstract": "Crimson Wave is a sensor-based wearable that generates information on its user’s menstrual cycle. Basal Body Temperature (BBT) is an individual’s resting temperature, which fluctuates slightly depending on the individual’s current menstrual stage. Crimson Wave tracks the user’s BBT through the wearable and then visually displays the data on a separate smart mirror. Specifically, the mirror lights up a corresponding color depending on where the user is in their menstrual cycle. Crimson Wave offers a novel method of keeping track of one’s health and integrating menstrual data seamlessly into daily life. The combination of live and aggregated personalized data helps optimize the day-to-day lives of those experiencing menstrual cycles. This project is helpful for people who are interested in being more informed about their cycles, especially when it is irregular. In this paper, we describe the concept behind Crimson Wave, as well as its implementation and iteration.",

      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "The interaction design community increasingly addresses how digital technologies may contribute to societal transformations. This paper aims at understanding transformation ignited by a particular constructive design research project. This transformation will be discussed and analysed using resilience thinking, an established approach within sustainability science. By creating a common language between these two disciplines, we start to identify what kind of transformation took place, what factors played a role in the transformation, and which transformative qualities played a role in creating these factors. Our intention is to set out how the notion of resilience might provide a new perspective to understand how constructive design research may produce results that have a sustainable social impact. The findings point towards ways in which these two different perspectives on transformation – the analytical perspective of resilience thinking and the generative perspective of constructive design research - may become complementary in both igniting and understanding transformations.",

      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "There is a widely-held belief in the TEI and games communities that using tangible props enhances the player performance and gaming experience. Building on prior research in gaming, we studied people playing a video game using a gestural interface without props, with an incomplete or a complete tangible prop. The interaction with the tangibles was judged to be more natural, led to higher flow experience and was preferred, but there were no differences regarding performance, enjoyment, autonomy, presence and mental effort. There was a tendency that especially the incomplete tangible prop was judged as less intuitive and people felt less competent in gameplay. In contrast to prior research, the results show that tangible interaction is not always more beneficial than gestural interaction and that, especially for incomplete tangibles, any beneficial effects may be domain-dependent.",
