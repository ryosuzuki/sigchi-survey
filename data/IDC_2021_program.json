The paper is based on experiences from master students in interaction design, who were instructed to define learning goals for children participating in PD activities that they organized in a school context. Based on the results of this study, we suggest a number of strategies for aligning and applying learning goals in PD in school contexts in practice: Debrief the results from the children’s reflections with the teachers, Scalability in regard to time and context, Adjust to age, Collaborate with the teacher to define specific learning goals, Formulate learning gains for the teachers, and Develop support materials.",

      "abstract": "Zoos have been consistently popular with young visitors, helping educate children in animal conservation. However, zoos' typical strategies employ interactive signs and videos, which children largely ignore. In pursuit of new engagement methods, children were invited to design for animals via ZooDesign, a gamified imaginative design approach centred on an educational card and role-playing game, ZooDesign assists children in envisaging how animals can use technologies, by exploring their welfare needs and humans' involvement. Many children designed with the animals' well-being in mind. Analysis of their creations and role-play interviews revealed that the method constitutes a good process but not all designs were appropriate for use with animals. Furthermore, few designs included the children themselves; most emphasised zookeeper and researcher roles instead. Building on child-computer interaction methods for zoo-based education contexts, the research raises key questions involved in educating children about animals. ",

      "abstract": "Engaging in physical computing activities involving both hardware and software provides a hands-on introduction to computer science. The move to remote learning for primary and secondary schools during the 2020-2021 school year due to COVID-19 made implementing physical computing activities especially challenging. However, it is important that these activities are not simply eliminated from the curriculum. This paper explores how a unit centered around students investigating how programmable sensors that can support data-driven scientific inquiry was collaboratively adapted for remote instruction. A case study of one teacher's experience implementing the unit with a group of middle school students (ages 11 to 14) in her STEM elective class examines how her students could still engage in computational thinking practices around data and programming. The discussion includes both the challenges and unexpected affordances of engaging in physical computing activities remotely that emerged from her implementation.",

      "abstract": "This Design-Based-Research doctoral study examines an embodied-design technological platform being developed for non-speaking children on the Autism spectrum. The study combines my background in Linguistics, examining the naturally-occurring embodied interactions of Autistic individuals, with a mixed-methodology approach through my Ph.D in Special Education. Autism is clinically characterized by difficulties in social communication and the frequent, intense production of rhythmic motor movement (stimming). The dominance of spoken language in everyday social interaction can exclude such children from being active social participants. How do we design for the inclusive social participation of non-speaking Autistic children by fore-fronting their strengths, and empowering them with communicative agency? Beyond referential language, this study instead returns to embodied action at the core of human interaction: synchrony, coordinated movement, and affective attunement. In this dissertation, I capitalize on the utility of rhythmicity in joint action, as well as the rhythmic quality of stimming by Autistic individuals, to foster rhythmical joint action between Autistic children and their parents and siblings. Through a touch-to-sound technological platform, I surface the body as a conduit through which interaction can happen, reclaiming touch as a basic modality through which rhythmical interaction can occur. Data collection for this project is underway with 12 Autistic children and their families. By combining touch and sound, the platform serves as an environment that promotes intercorporeal rhythmical interaction. ",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we describe an exploratory study of how design fiction can be used to introduce machine learning (ML) to 14-15 year old students in an engaging way. The study describes three sessions conducted online that combined hands-on and design fiction activities related to supervised ML, focusing on facial analysis. Based on semi-structured interviews and field notes, we discuss how the design fiction approach seemed to be engaging and supportive for students' reflection on their relationship with technology. In future work, we will expand the study to include a larger number of students, assess their learning, and further explore connections between ML and its societal implications.",

It has a haptic interface and can connect children (especially during the COVID-19 pandemic) while avoiding the usage of screen-based media. It combines social interaction inspired from online gaming with a playful way to learn about music and instruments. We present a handcrafted prototype manufactured from e-textiles, wool and grape seeds. The sssnake prototype was evaluated in a user study with ten children aged between one and eight years. The study showed that online-connected soft toys can be an extension to traditional possibilities of socializing and play.",

      "abstract": "Executive functions (EF), a set of cognitive processes necessary for goal-oriented behavior, are critical for children's school outcomes and often lacking when children arrive in elementary school. One of the most promising interventions to address this gap is Tools of the Mind (ToM), a Vygotskyan approach to early childhood education with a strong emphasis on sociodramatic play. One challenge in implementing this kind of play is supporting children in joining play with their peers. In this paper we present a content analysis of an eight-week evaluation comparing implementing ToM-style play with and without technology supports. We found that one specific aspect of the technology supports, a voice agent, played a crucial role in integrating shy children into sociodramatic play.",

      "abstract": "Playing games is an inherent part of children’s lives as it impacts several aspects of their physical and mental development. Technological advances have been manifesting new and exciting avenues of interaction when children play games, ranging from board and card games, to videogames that are played on mobile devices, virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) headsets, robotic systems, and social agents. These games encompass a wide range of applications aiming to provide educational benefits, promote development, enhance well-being, or simply enjoy leisure time. Along with the fun and excitement, these advancements also bring unique challenges in the game design process due to the inclusion of complex technology, the maximization of the players’ engagement and expectations and interests of the children. The player-centric approach of co-designing games with the target audience has a unique position as it involves creating the games for and with the children, allowing them to act as an equal stakeholder rather than simple users or informants. This half-day workshop aims to expose the researchers to collaborative techniques used in game design to create interactive and playful activities for children that involve contemporary technologies such as AR/VR and social agents.\r\n",

      "abstract": " Voice agents are becoming deeply integrated into the daily lives of millions of people, yet adults and children perceive and use them differently. Therefore, it is important to understand how parents and children envision the future of these agents. We enrolled 22 parent-teen dyads in an asynchronous remote community-based (ARC) method study. Each dyad consisting of a parent and a teen,  participated in nine weekly activities over a period of eight weeks, followed by an exit interview. The participants discussed their desires and fears, such as those regarding agency, emotion recognition, voice characteristics and forms, the timing of their interactions, and voice agents’ acting on behalf of others. The dyads appreciated the flexibility in participation, their ability to send responses privately to the researchers, their access to a channel for socializing with other participants, and the opportunity to build on ideas through sequential interactions during ARC activities. In the end, we discuss how our findings might inform the design of future voice agents and present recommendations for adapting ARC method while designing with parent-teen dyads.",

      "abstract": "The story-stem approach is a reliable and valid method in child psychiatry for investigating children's social understanding, such as in family/peer relationships. Research is on-going into automating the use of story-stems as the approach takes a lot of time and there are often few administrators trained to administer them. A key part of automation is detecting if a child is engaged in the story-stems; if the child is not engaged, then automated techniques will not work. The study focuses on measuring child engagement using observed facial expressions and specifically on understanding the effect of multimedia digital story-stems on their engagement levels to create a better and more engaging digital story-stem. This ensures that psychiatrists who assess story stems with videos will know whether the child involved is engaged with the story-stems and can be assessed properly.\r\nThe spontaneous facial expressions of 40 children were collected while watching digital story-stems using an RGB video camera and their engagement levels can be automatically classified using observed facial expressions. Meanwhile, we look at different styles of voice (gender and expressiveness) and video format (animation vs live-action recorded) in the story-stems to see how this affected child engagement. The distribution of child engagement across different media types was compared and the results showed that children were more engaged in a story-stem narrated by a female expressive voice. While comparing the two video formats, although children were more engaged in the current version of animated videos, there were still some factors, such as doll appearance, to be investigated for the design of story-stems.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 emergency has posed many challenges to the worldwide school system leading to school closures and massive adoption of distance education. These events affected not only the way education is delivered but also the overall school community’s wellbeing and cohesion. In this paper, we present a playful education platform originally designed to promote sustainable mobility in schools that has been adapted to support distance learning and community engagement during the health emergency. In the original version of the platform, the home-school distances traveled by students with sustainable means contributed to the advancement of the whole class in a collective virtual trip associated with playful learning material. Conversely, in a revised version of the platform adapted to the new context, students could advance in the virtual trip by reporting the good deeds performed at home. Findings from 161 questionnaires completed by teachers, families, and students, as well as results from online workshops with students, and the analysis of log files at the end of the school year revealed the opportunities and limitations of converting a playful activity conceived for being experienced in class into an online activity to be completed at home. The results show that the adapted version contributed to the school community cohesion and provided a positive experience to all its members, even though it was not able to completely overcome the generalized feeling of isolation. This paper contributes to understanding the social value of collaborative and playful digital activities that involve the entire school community, showing how technology can impact education and support communities in times of crisis.",

However, at school, children are encouraged to engage in formal modes of expression, such as writing. This paper aims to explore how we may design tools that support children in writing using body-based enactment as a scaffold. In our study, 17 children used an interactive story authoring system to enact and record stories as videos and then write the stories while viewing them. We compared the story enactment videos and the corresponding written story essays in terms of the narrative structure, content, and coherence. Our results show a significant difference in story structure in the two formats and a marginally significant difference in the coherence ratings. We present our findings in terms of learned lessons for designing children's enactment-based authoring tools to encourage more substantial written outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Embodied learning creates a range of opportunities for children to find new ways to develop their learning by engaging in stimulating activities. This PhD project leverages capabilities offered from multi-sensory environments (MSEs) to amplify children’s interaction and the learning experience. With a goal to achieve the following overarching research question: How capabilities offered from multi-sensory environments can improve the interaction and learning capacity of a system? The first step of the PhD project (that is in the write-up phase), is a literature review that provides a comprehensive basis of theoretical and empirical knowledge in the area of MSEs and children's learning. The second step (that is underway) is a qualitative research study with a focus on child's support sphere stakeholders (e.g., parents, teachers, caregivers). Therefore, a series of interviews have been conducted with teachers with experience in employing MSEs to support children's learning. The results of this study will provide insights on how to design and develop an efficient MSE that takes into consideration stakeholders' needs. The next, is the development of a conceptual framework on how multi-sensory interaction can support children's learning; alongside with the respective prototypes. The last step consists of a series of iterative (co-re)design-develop-test cycles, that will allow the refinement of the framework and the respective prototypes, based on the empirical evidence collected from children's experience. By the end of the PhD project, the necessary prototypes, empirical and conceptual knowledge will give us all the necessary components for enabling multi-sensory capabilities to reinforce children’s interaction and learning. The methodology includes qualitative and quantitative data (e.g., log files, observations, interviews and surveys), collected during in-the-wild studies with children and their support sphere (e.g., teachers and parents).",

      "abstract": " This paper describes a cross-cultural pilot study on children’s perceptions of fairness in robot-related scenarios with children in Japan (N=20) and Uganda (N=24). We used storytelling to facilitate children’s narratives on fairness and to identify areas of alignment and disconnect. Initial results indicate that while both groups referred to similar aspects of fairness, namely psychological, physical and systemic, children in Tokyo focused more on psychological and mental aspects while children in Uganda emphasised on physical and material aspects. Both groups increased their emphasis on mental aspects in robot-related scenarios. All children expressed their interest to further explore fairness and unfairness as experienced by children with different cultural backgrounds and the need for inter-group contact. The results of this study will contribute to the first phase of a study with robots and children in relation to child's fundamental rights and to the dialogue about the requirements for fairness in robot development by highlighting the importance of considering children’s perspectives especially those of typically under-represented cultural groups.",

      "abstract": "One of the most critical social functions of museums is education. At the same time, a museum is also a space where audiences can benefit directly from it with learning. This paper proposes a design framework that addresses multimodality in interactive exhibitions on abstract knowledge. In contrast to previous research, this study emphasizes the differences between the traditional exhibition and interactive formats in which application narrating by oneself and dialogue into abstract knowledge. The study explores metacognition, animation, embodied interaction, and blending theory, with a project on design practice: Tibet Planetarium in Lhasa – an International Planetarium, serving as a case study of the combined implementation of these theories. First, we put forward a theoretical framework for the informal learning goals of design. Based on the context of interaction and promoting abstract knowledge, a design approach to interaction is proposed, and its application is introduced.",

In this workshop, we invite researchers and practitioners to reflect on what is at stake if the IDC community does not intentionally take a justice-centered approach throughout our methods, our research questions, and our everyday interactions with youth. The goals of our workshop are two-fold: (1) To share stories about the actions we take as researchers with power to influence change in our interactions with youth, and (2) To establish the commitments the IDC community can make for more equitable design and research engagements with youth.

      "abstract": "Could computational thinking be a strong tool for children to understand complex 21st-century issues? Our knowledge is limited since most designs focus on sequential programming and on the cognitive aspects of computational thinking. This paper discusses a design that integrates ill-structured socio-scientific issues with programming and other computational concepts, in a playful and meaningful context. The design, called ChoiCo (Choices with Consequences), builds on the idea of \"integrated affordances\" that enables layered computational access, allowing children to be players and designers of choice-driven simulation games. We elaborate on a design-based research that studied children's activity, who progressively played, modified and co-created games that simulated real-world issues. We describe four strategies developed by the children to make sense of the simulated problems through a systems thinking approach. We also discuss how they formulated these strategies by utilizing the affordances of map design, data manipulation and coding.",

      "abstract": "Scientific inquiry involves prediction, observation and explanation (POE) of phenomena and data. Appropriate guidance through these steps is essential for helping students learn and form positive attitudes towards science. Sensor-based education toolkits are becoming a popular way to provide this guidance, but they typically present different interfaces for measurement and learning materials which places a high cognitive demand on learners. To address this challenge, we developed a web application to integrate the scientific inquiry method where students are guided step-by-step, using a scaffolded-learning approach, through slide-based worksheets that provide direct interaction with real-time sensor measurements. We evaluate this approach through a qualitative analysis of data collected from two field studies in classrooms with a total of 42 students. We show that our approach encouraged positivity and further learning in science. Students displayed and expressed interest to conduct science experiments outside of class. We identify design implications for seamless learning, storytelling and integration of POE guided scientific inquiry with sensor-based toolkits.",

      "abstract": "The rapid adoption of smart home speakers into households has enabled young children to verbally communicate with voice assistants (VAs). VAs, such as Amazon Alexa, allow children to use their voice to play various game-based activities and offer opportunities to understand children’s communication during child-agent communication. This qualitative study describes findings from video analysis of young children between three and six years old who engaged in voice-based gameplay with two commercial Alexa Skills, Animal Sounds and Animal Game. We report findings about verbal behaviors and communication breakdowns and repairs between children and Alexa, and discuss key considerations for designing voice games for children.",

      "abstract": "There are ethical concerns surrounding how youth interact with biowearable technology and the potential effects it has on their psychological and physiological health. We need to give youth the tools to critically reflect and explore ethical issues surrounding biowearables in order for them to make informed decisions about how they interact with them. To address this, we developed the Biotech Ethics cards as part of a critical making workshop. They are a set of design cards designed to scaffold critical reflection during a critical making workshop where youth prototype a biowearable from a kit. We focus this short paper on the requirements, initial design and revisions we made after studying card use in our workshop. We identified key design elements that are important in the cards and that may generalize to the design of other card sets meant to be integrated into a critical making process. ",

      "abstract": "Computational thinking is nowadays considered an essential skill in the K-12 educational curriculum. Many tangible computational kits designed for early childhood are either too expensive to benefit a wide range of children or only provide predetermined challenges with limited creative content creation opportunities. In this paper, we investigated low-cost and expressive tangible interfaces that foster computational literacy. We present Draw2Code, a paper-based computational kit for young children to create an interactive AR animation. Children use Draw2Code to make their paper drawing alive as an animated virtual sprite and control it using hand gestures. It exposes children to basic programming concepts through playful and tangible interaction. Results from our initial evaluation with nine child-parent dyads indicate that children age 5 to 12 successfully used Draw2Code and played with Draw2Code in 33 minutes on average while creating 2 to 5 diverse AR animations. Through the session, all children were engaged in computational thinking concepts and practices and learned drawing and gesture-based interactions. ",

      "abstract": "As young children’s screen time has significantly increased in recent years, their healthy use of digital media is a topic of interest. To support children’s healthy screen use, we are developing Romi, a physical screen peripheral device interface. Romi was designed to help children to transition from screen to out-of-screen by reducing negative experiences when ending screen time. To specify the design concept, we conducted the preliminary interview and experience prototyping focusing on screen-time transition. Based on design attributes which are the peripheral presence, the connection between screen and device, and friendly character, we implemented Romi interface. We believe our approach will provide motivation and inspiration for designing a physical interface for supporting children’s self-regulation.",

      "abstract": "Drawing from a present need as well as a growing interest towards developing methods to engage participants in research remotely [1,2], this workshop focuses on identifying opportunities and challenges around designing with children from an embodiment perspective [3,4,5,6,10,11,12,13,15]. Themed around whole body interaction and digital technologies [3,7,8,9,10,11,15,16,17,18,20,21] the aim of this workshop is to gain methodological insights for the remote participation of children in design, and arrive at design insights addressing the question how we can design remote, inclusive whole body interactions for and with children while attending to child participants’ multimodal communication and bodily engagement [19,21] in a physically dislocated setting [1,2]. The workshop will involve discussions around data gathering from different angles, including relational, ethical, safety and practical perspectives, to create a comprehensive picture of what it entails to orchestrate embodied co-design workshops with children virtually. Outputs from the workshop will contribute to the IDC community by offering methodological insights from attendees’ own experience and presented case studies from researchers and practitioners from both non-academic and academic settings to support children’s embodied engagement in remote workshop situations and beyond.",

      "abstract": "In this workshop, we invite researchers and practitioners as participants in co-designing the protocol for the world’s largest Distributed Participatory Design (DPD) project with children. Participatory Design – whose inclusive benefits are broadly recognized in design – can be very challenging, especially when involving children. The current COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to further barriers to PD with such groups. Recent key barriers include social distancing and government-imposed social restrictions due to the additional health risks to vulnerable children and their families. This disrupts traditional in-person PD (which involves close socio-emotional and often physical collaboration between participants and researchers). However, alongside such barriers, we have identified opportunities for new and augmented approaches to PD across distributed geographies, backgrounds, ages and abilities. We invite the CCI community to examine Distributed Participatory Design(DPD) as a solution for overcoming these new barriers, during and after COVID-19. Together, we offer new ways to think about DPD, and unpick some of its ambiguities. This workshop builds on work conducted in a similar workshop in IDC 2020, and this year will focus on the planning and design of the protocol for the world’s largest DPD project with children",

Importantly, studies have shown that children with autism are much more receptive to SARs in therapy while resulting in similar learning outcomes. Given the sensitive nature of therapy and the current state of autonomous robots, in practice robots are teleoperated by a therapist controlling their motion and dialogue. There is an opportunity to produce more effective teleoperation interfaces of SARs in the context of therapy for children with autism. In this paper, I outline research for improving teleoperation interfaces of SARs through (1) analyzing current teleoperation usage, (2) interviewing therapists about their needs, and (3) implementing and evaluating varied designs for teleoperation interfaces.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning systems have become ubiquitous into our society. This has raised concerns about the potential discrimination that these systems might exert due to unconscious bias present in the data, for example regarding gender and race. Whilst this issue has been proposed as an essential subject to be included in the new AI curricula for schools, research has shown that it is a difficult topic to grasp by students. We propose an educational platform tailored to raise the awareness of gender bias in supervised learning, with the novelty of using Grad-CAM as an explainability technique that enables the classifier to visually explain its own predictions. Our study demonstrates that preadolescents (N=78, age 10-14) significantly improve their understanding of the concept of bias in terms of gender discrimination, increasing their ability to recognize biased predictions when they interact with the interpretable model, highlighting its suitability for educational programs.",

As children disproportionately benefit from scaffolding during the co-design process, we also report on an evaluation of the technique with 16 children, conducted across seven sessions and spanning the course of one year. We find that WYR fulfills recommendations for focus groups (e.g. eliciting mental models and values, producing focused yet animated discussion) and leverages playfulness, humor, structure, and forced choice to overcome known common challenges of designing with children.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we take a step towards understanding how to design search engine results pages (SERP) that encourage children's engagement as they seek for online resources. For this, we conducted a participatory design session to enable us to elicit children's preferences and determine what children (ages 6--12) find lacking in more traditional SERP. We learned that children want more dynamic means of navigating results and additional ways to interact with results via icons. We use these findings to inform the design of a new SERP interface, which we denoted CHIRP. To gauge the type of engagement that a SERP incorporating interactive elements--CHIRP--can foster among children, we conducted a user study at a public school. Analysis of children's interactions with CHIRP, in addition to responses to a post-task survey, reveals that adding additional interaction points results in a SERP interface that children prefer, but one that does not necessarily change engagement levels through clicks or time spent on SERP.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores how parents and children collaborate during a playful computational activity with a codable robot. We conducted interaction analysis of moments from two cases in which a parent and their daughter worked together to choose and input numerical values in their codes that would send the robot in a desired direction. Our analyses reveal how parents and children decide on this value through a process of mapping across symbol systems. We suggest that a shared understanding of these symbols’ meaning is critical for the mapping process, and that the process is impacted by the affordances of the representational tools the pair employs. The paper concludes with a discussion of design implications for supporting parent-child collaboration during play with a codable robot.",

      "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) can provide an advanced lens for K-12 students to get their hands on intriguing patterns from real-world data and has the potential to empower young learners with more challenging cognitive skills needed for iterative scientific investigation. However, few efforts have been taken to unearth the unique challenges to engage K-12 teachers and students in ML-empowered scientific discovery (SD) learning. Moreover, it is under-explored what scaffolding can be designed to mitigate the challenges. Based on our previous study and literature research, we identified three gaps for novice learners to conduct ML-empowered SD: (1) the extraneous cognitive load in ML visual analytics; (2) synthesizing multivariate patterns for hypothesis development; (3) evidence evaluation during the iterative investigation. We also propose three corresponding scaffolding components and evaluation studies for the next step.",

      "abstract": "Social robots hold potential for implementation in future educational environments by engaging children in motivating and embodied learning settings. However, how children enter into social interaction with an interlocutor is substantially influenced by their individual differences. In this paper, we address children's temperamental trait of shyness and explore how it influences children’s proxemic behavior in a long-term interaction involving language learning with either a social robot or a human. We operationalized proxemics by measuring children's time spent in four different proxemic zones during the interaction. Overall, our results highlight that shy children in particular approach the interaction partner in a more distant way when compared with less shy peers. When both interaction partners (robot and human) were compared with each other, however, our findings suggest that shy children display similar proxemic behavior. Findings are discussed with regard to the role of shyness during children’s interactions with social robots and the implications for future interaction design.",

      "abstract": "Social virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a popular online space for teenagers to interact and socialize. It attracts teens due to the broad range of immersive activities and social engagement opportunities, along with diverse users in terms of age and interest. Yet, little is known about teenagers’ experiences and understandings of this emerging online social space, especially regarding what aspects may attract or dissuade them to social VR. To explore this question, we conducted in-depth interviews with 20 teenagers (e.g., ages13-18) and reported findings regarding what attracted them to engage in social VR and challenges with social VR that may dissuade them from using it. Our findings contribute to the growing body of scholarship on teenagers’ experiences in emerging, novel online social spaces and highlight potential design implications for creating safer and more fulfilling social VR experiences for teenagers.",

We present ACCembly, an accessible block-based environment that enables children with visual impairments to perform spatial programming activities. ACCembly allows children to assemble tangible blocks to program a multimodal robot. We evaluated this approach with seven families that used the system autonomously at home. Results showed that both the children and family members learned from what was an inclusive and engaging experience. Children leveraged fundamental computational thinking concepts to solve spatial programming challenges; parents took different roles as mediators, some actively teaching and scaffolding, others learning together with their child. We contribute with an environment that enables children with visual impairments to engage in spatial programming activities, an analysis of parent-child interactions, and reflections on inclusive programming environments within a shared family experience.",

The main contribution will be new learning experiences in secondary schools that support children’s critical and constructive engagement with emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things, Augmented Reality, and Machine Learning. The thesis leverages theoretical strands within Child-Computer Interaction on constructionism and design fiction to combine hands-on learning and technological imagination. Preliminary results from Participatory Design interventions (Fall 2020) indicate that the combination of constructionism and design fiction provides a beneficial methodological framework for supporting children’s understanding of societal implications of emerging technologies while also gaining a deeper understanding of the technology fundamentals.",

For children to engage with and one day contribute to finding sustainable solutions, they must learn not just science concepts, but also how to think critically about the role of the human in the systems we exist in.\r\nIn this paper, we present a design approach that involves human (teachers and children) and non-human agents (biomaterials and augmented reality), to create educational tools that promote learning of science subjects and critical thinking in children. We describe the resulting prototype, Circular Species, which comes in the form of a biodegradable woolly mammoth toy and accompanying AR app that teaches the carbon cycle. We share insights gathered from testing Circular Species through in-classroom workshops with students aged 8-11 in London and New York schools.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Under the umbrella of smart toys, a myriad of interactive systems have addressed a variety of scenarios considering entertainment, education, sustainability, social and environmental learning through play. Tangibles and small toy robots prevail; but interaction technology based on wearables, conversational interfaces or augmented reality may also be part of this landscape to implement smart toys that are both social and/or connected. In the second edition of this workshop, we set a special focus on challenges associated to opening smart toys to different degrees of \"connectedness'',  and reflecting on concerns regarding data privacy and ethics when smart toys are reframed to function in a connected way. After the pandemic, social isolation forced us to change the way we interact with each other. We are convinced that smart technologies can open new avenues for promoting social connectedness enabling more interactive playing and learning activities. ",

In this paper, we use autoethnographic reflection and thematic analysis to compare and contrast the functionality and pedagogical applications of these two circuits. We explore how the circuits could facilitate complementary approaches to electronics education by pairing more and less predictable sonic outcomes. We further consider how the circuits and scaffolding activities might be redesigned to better align with goals of constructivist and constructionist learning environments.  ",

      "abstract": "Millions of children now use conversational agents (CAs), leading researchers and the public alike to ask how interactions with these devices might shape children's communication with people. We conducted a single-session observational lab study with 22 five-to-ten-year-old children as a step toward understanding whether and how children might transfer a linguistic routine they learned from a CA to a conversation with another person. We found that 68% of children spontaneously used this routine in a conversation with their parent in the lab, and 55% continued to use it at home. When addressing parents, children infused the routine with warmth and playfulness that they did not use when addressing the CA, adapting it to suit their relationship with their parent. However, only 18% of children used it in conversation with an unfamiliar researcher, where they instead were more likely to follow conventional conversational norms. These findings suggest children are quick to learn linguistic routines from CAs but use social differentiation when they apply them. Children's willingness to expand on and share the routine with their parent is consistent with the principles of the Joint Media Engagement (JME) framework and suggests CAs may be a productive medium for creating JME experiences.",

      "abstract": "Children with mild intellectual disability (MID) and borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) have problems with adequate social behavior. Children with MID or BIF seem no different from typically developing children as preschoolers. However, from school age, children with MID or BIF begin to have problems with their social skills, requiring special education. In the special education, emotion recognition and empathy responses are important. Serious games using interactive design exist to help children with disabilities learn social skills, but little has been done for children with MID or BIF. To support emotion recognition and empathy behavior in children with MID or BIF, we developed a story-based serious game called MODU. We conducted a user study of a pair of siblings, one with MID and one with BIF, to explore the educational effects of MODU. Based on our findings, we investigated MODU’s educational possibilities.",

      "abstract": "This project was started to explore ways we can utilize the benefits of human-robot facilitated therapy to support a child’s emotional development and identify needs for early intervention. As a result, we designed an app prototype called Dot’s World that features a chatbot that leads daily conversations about emotional well-being and facilitates emotional education exercises. We also created a companion app prototype for parents to involve them in their child’s emotional growth and identify needs for early intervention. To understand the current perceptions of emotional health and existing solutions for support, we conducted customer discovery interviews with parents and education professionals like teachers, psychologists, and counselors. Multiple factors in the interview process including variations in technology access as well as confidence in traditional methods of emotional development have led us to pivot our original vision. Interviews with professionals in the education system helped us to realize an apparent need for a platform providing socio-emotional tools for educators and improving communication channels within the child’s support system. We will be iterating on Dot’s World’s design and conducting more interviews to better understand and support the need of this new demographic.",

As more computing education programs are created, we need to bring youth and their communities into the fold of determining how the learning environment can serve them. This study seeks to explore ways for youth and their families to share how computing/STEM affects their community, then how to design an informal learning program with them. To do this, I propose using a photovoice project to invite youth and their families to show how STEM/computing affects their lives. The outcome of this research will help inform the design of informal computing education programs towards being more inclusive of learners whose identities are underrepresented in computing. ",

      "abstract": "Participatory simulations usually aim to bring simulations off screen into a shared physical space with people acting as agents in the simulation. In this paper, we describe considerations and design decisions related to creating a participatory simulation for use in learning settings with restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic where typical classroom interactions were no longer allowed. We describe how our design decisions might help children both \"dive in\" and \"step out\" to understand more about pollinators and the prairie in spite of various restrictions on how exactly they can interact with each other. Our simulation, Buzz About, uses augmented reality in a multi-device setting to allow learners to explore the impacts of a prairie restoration on local beneficial pollinators from the perspective of a bee. We focus on supporting scenarios where the children may be in a shared space with social-distancing requirements or participating remotely, but synchronously.",

      "abstract": "This work in progress proposes a new approach for the design of personas representing children in preschool (aged 3-6 years old). Starting from the need to design technology for the collective use in the classroom, we looked at the group composed by the children and the teacher, the different possible ways teachers relate to children in a classroom context, and the way they work together towards a common goal. In this study, we analyse the dynamics of the group in relation to literacy-building activities and storytelling in school. Considering the inherent difficulty in interviewing children of preschool age, we decided to conduct interviews with teachers and experts and adopt a proxy approach to design of our personas. Using the data gathered from interviews and extracted from the literature regarding child-personas and adult-child reading, we start outlining a framework for the design of teacher-children collective personas in a formal educational context.",

      "abstract": "As one of the largest initiatives to introduce K-12 youth to computing, the Hour of Code has reached hundreds of millions of students around the globe. While Hour of Code activities have been immensely successful, they have also been criticized for their focus on puzzle-like close-ended guided activities leaving out more creative and critical engagement with computing. In this paper, we report on efforts to design CodeQuilt, an Hour-of-Code-style activity in which middle and high school youth were asked to design Scratch projects that engage with issues on who and what is computing. We analyzed over 100 Scratch projects posted on the public CodeQuilt site in addition to reflective responses provided by participating youth. We found that a wide array of Scratch projects engaged creatively by integrating popular media but only a small number of projects focused on critical issues. In the discussion, we outline next steps for better supporting more critical and creative engagement with computing in Hour of Code activities. ",

Bubble Beats aims to explore the effectiveness of combining music rhythm and breathing exercises. In the game, children blow bubbles to the music rhythm with visual guidance. Initial user tests show that Bubble Beats can effectively motivate children and improve their adherence to breathing exercises. We will continue to iterate and upgrade the system to attract and match a more diverse population, for example, patients recovering from pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. ",

This has prompted us to focus the 5thEdition of the International and Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Children & Recommender and Information Retrieval Systems (KidRec) around a major stakeholder when it comes to technology adoption for the classroom: the teacher. Much like in the previous editions of the workshop, our priority remains understanding what is good when it comes to information retrieval systems for children, this time from the perspectives of teachers. In order to control scope of our discussion and continue to advance knowledge in this area, we focus on technology that enables information discovery in the classroom context: search and recommendation systems. Expected outcomes from this workshop remain building community in this important area of work and extend the framework we have been defining to enable design and evaluation of good information retrieval systems for children.

      "abstract": "The worldwide refugee crisis is a major current challenge, affecting the health and education of millions of families with children due to displacement. Despite the various challenges and risks of migration practices, numerous refugee families have access to interactive technologies during these processes. The aim of this ongoing study is to explore the role of technologies in the transitions of refugee families in Scotland. Based on Tudge’s ecocultural theory, a qualitative case-study approach has been adopted. Semi-structured interviews have been conducted with volunteers who work with refugee families in a big city in Scotland, and proxy observations of young children were facilitated remotely by their refugee parents. A preliminary overview of the participants’ insights of the use and role of technology for transitioning into a new culture is provided here.",

      "abstract": "There are many ways to look at the efficacy and value of the inclusion of children in design activities within HCI. Whilst the experience of participation can be highly beneficial for children, there is value, even if it is only to confirm the merit of the children’s participation, in looking at the process of ideation and in considering to what extent children can ideate.  Whilst design is by nature untethered, being able to capture and consider the diversity of design ideas across multiple design teams and to look at how such ideas are developed, can facilitate reflection and potentially improve practice.  This work explores the diversity of ideas and the iterative development of ideas during the incremental design of a mobile game with 26 teen informants working in small groups over four design sessions.  A method to visualize the evolution of ideas across design sessions is presented. Groups’ behaviors are mapped to three positions according to how conservative and how innovative the participants were.  We explore the implications of our work for practitioners and researchers.",

      "abstract": "The popularity of mobile devices for learning outside conventional classrooms necessitates the exploration of the many challenges which can impede the learning process for children using them. Key among these is the possibility of disorientation, occurring when children are faced with stimuli external to their learning task which can redirect their attention elsewhere. This paper explores the several factors which can contribute towards disorienting children from their learning task in an informal learning environment (ILE) using science festivals as a context. We detail the design and deployment of a mobile leaf identification application used by attendees at a child-focused science festival in a setting filled with distractions. Participating children used the app to watch an educational video about leaves, and were asked to identify the leaves around the exhibit correctly by taking a picture using the app. From our observations, we derive the key factors which can disorient young learners in an ILE and the ones which help them reorient towards the learning task. We conclude by providing considerations for designing mobile applications for children to be used in ILEs which can promote informal learning while minimizing disorientation.",

We examine the participation of children and their families in the Family Creative Learning program, a culturally responsive computing context that engages families to create and share stories with computing. Our findings highlight the ways that families discovered new possibilities for their storytelling using the computational construction kit, but they also experienced challenges in representing their stories and themselves. We discuss the opportunities in storytelling with construction kits and possible limitations when designing to support expression, especially among groups historically marginalized from computing spaces.",

However, as many schools adopt a remote learning model due to COVID pandemic conditions, a pressing need has arisen for instructional practices and tools that facilitate project-based distance learning. This work in progress presents the design process of a QR-code enabled learning tool for instructors and students working with electronics in introductory physical computing courses. Through iterative learning design research and deployment in two 3-week micro courses, we uncovered preliminary evidence for the versatility of tactile card decks in supporting disciplinary based learning behaviors, debugging practices, visual and remote communication, as well as the opportunities for enhancing knowledge transfer enabled through digital augmentation.",

      "abstract": "Immersive technology, such as virtual reality (VR), has become more integrated in children’s lives transforming how they experience education, medical treatment, and entertainment. In VR, children are likely to engage with interactive and socially real characters. To examine children’s experience of virtual characters in VR, we studied 5-to 9-year old’s (N= 25) spontaneous reactions towards three virtual character types (human, anthropomorphized fictional Muppet, animal). Results showed children engaged in four major behavioral interactions: they tried to touch the characters, embodied the characters, talked directly to the characters, and referred to themselves in regard to the virtual environment. These results suggest that children test concepts of realism through touch and verbalizations and physically examine social boundaries. Additionally, children consider self-representation while in a virtual environment. We discuss the implications of these results for future work and provide design considerations when creating VR content with and for children.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the design of tools and pedagogies for bio-design understood as a critical space for learners to reflect on nature-culture dualism as a philosophical root of the environmental crisis. By blurring the boundaries between the learning practices of making and growing, bio-design allows learners to imagine what it means to produce artifacts at the frontier of natural and artificial. We propose the concept of interspecies creative learning to advance in the understanding of learning experiences that engage humans and other living systems in a joint space of creative discovery. Using design-based research, we share the work-in-progress design of Myco-kit, a bio-design toolkit to support interspecies creative learning and advance in the understanding of this concept and its implications for ecologically conscious education.",

      "abstract": "Growing up in an artificial intelligence-filled world, with Siri and Amazon Alexa often within arm's—or speech's—reach, could  have significant impact on children. Conversational agents could influence how students anthropomorphize computer systems or develop a theory of mind. Previous research has explored how conversational agents are used and perceived by children within and outside of learning contexts. This study investigates how middle and high school students' perceptions of Alexa change through programming their own conversational agents in week-long AI education workshops. Specifically, we investigate the workshops' influence on student perceptions of Alexa's intelligence, friendliness, aliveness, safeness, trustworthiness, human-likeness, and feelings of closeness. We found that students felt Alexa was more intelligent and felt closer to Alexa after the workshops. We also found strong correlations between students' perceptions of Alexa's friendliness and trustworthiness, and safeness and trustworthiness. We recommend designers carefully consider personification, transparency, playfulness and utility when designing conversational agents for learning contexts.",

      "abstract": "Learning tasks designed with social or educational robots are becoming increasingly commonplace, with emerging methodologies being proposed regarding the design of interaction patterns for child-robot-interaction (cHRI). Yet, technological limitations remain a strong barrier to the implementation of fully autonomous robot tutoring systems. In addition, there is currently no research on how social and educational robots might be combined when designing learning tasks. Consequently, in this paper we describe the design and pilot testing of a (semi) autonomous learning task designed with a social robot (NAO) and educational robot (Cozmo) targeted at children's computational thinking skills. Preliminary data from a pilot phase with 53 children is promising, and results are discussed with regards to identified challenges. Several solutions are proposed in the context of designing interactions for cHRI. ",

      "abstract": "Computational thinking (CT) is necessary for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) literacy, but it can be difficult for many students to develop and it is challenging to integrate into science curricula. Here, we present a five-session curriculum where sixth-grade students programmed a Liquid Handling Robot (LHR) to conduct a science experiment while engaging in CT. We used a mixed-methods approach to assess how the curricular integration of robotics and science experimentation advances students' CT skills and perceptions of computation in science. We identified growth in CT skills, specifically regarding Algorithmic Thinking. Students identified as key advantages of this approach the increased precision in experimental procedures, time-efficiency, and easier debugging. This course provides a proof of concept curriculum on how the implications for teaching and learning of CT can be assessed, and how CT and robotics can be brought to science classrooms, especially for chemistry and biology.",

With PlushPal, children attach micro:bit hardware to stuffed animals, design custom gestures for their toy, and build gesture-recognition ML models to trigger their own sounds. We describe how, in the context of storytelling, PlushPal introduces core concepts in ML including data sampling and model evaluation. We conducted online workshops and in-person play sessions with 11 children between 8-14 years old building interactive stuffed animals with PlushPal. In these play sessions, we observed how children imagined bringing their toys to life using ML, as well as how children’s data literacy changed as a result of experimenting with sensors, data sampling, and building their own ML models. Our work contributes a novel design space for children to express their ideas using gesture, as well as a description of observed debugging practices, building on efforts to support children using ML to enhance creative play.",

In our research we sought to create a safe space in the virtual world, Whyville, for youth to “play” with serious topics of infection, asymptomatic disease transmission, prevention measures, and research and reporting of public health information. We examined the logfiles of 1,022 youth aged 10-18 years (mean = 13.7 years) who participated in an outbreak of a virtual virus, SPIKEY-20, in October and November 2020. Analyzing log files, we found that player engagement in productive infectious disease practices increased, including information seeking as well as purchases and usage of personal protective equipment during the virtual epidemic. In the discussion, we address the potential for virtual epidemics to provide a safe, playful space to practice and learn how to productively confront infectious disease and build promising connections between virtual and real-life epidemics.",

Specifically, I would be building interactive experiences that\r\nintroduce sighted and blind children to basic concepts of machine learning.",

      "abstract": "Observational sketching is a common method to facilitate repeated observations that increase individual knowledge and awareness of biodiversity. However, this method presents a high barrier of entry for some novices, particularly young children. In this paper, we introduce Bio Sketchbook, a novice AI-assisted sketching partner to help children draw from observation and guide them to repeatedly observe different biological features. We describe our design process and goals, the interaction design of Bio Sketchbook, and results from a preliminary user study with six children. Our findings reveal Bio Sketchbook as a promising AI partner to encourage children to sketch from observation and gain biodiversity science education.",

      "abstract": "Singing is a very common activity among people and especially children. It is of particular importance in young ages, as it has been suggested to promote the children’s social integration. While singing is a key component of elementary music classes, proper vocal training of young individuals has not been implemented into the current Greek elementary school curriculum. In addition, oftentimes music teachers are not trained to provide proper vocal instruction to young individuals. This work is part of the ASMA research project, which focuses on the social and aesthetic importance of student vocal training and the development of interactive applications supporting its instruction in elementary schools. The main hypothesis is that new technologies informing modern teaching methodologies can support proper vocal practice, by offering teachers individualized feedback on each student's needs. Within this framework, this paper discusses the development of a set of tools assisting music teachers build individualized vocal profiles for each student based on simple vocal acoustic measurements.",

Exposing students to cybersecurity education at an early age is critical for raising awareness and knowledge. Yet access to cybersecurity education curricular materials that are engaging for young students is limited. In this work, we present interactive cybersecurity stories for students in grades 3-5 delivered through a commercial social robot. Through focus groups and interviews we subsequently investigated teachers’ views on using a social robot for cybersecurity education, interest in incorporating social robots in the classroom, and perceptions of the ways in which social robots can impact teaching practice and student learning. Findings indicated that teachers found the social robot engaging and expressed interest in using it in their classroom despite some concerns. Findings have implications for the design and implementation of cybersecurity curricula delivered through emerging technologies.\r\n\r\n",

The children in the margins in the Global South encompasses those with little or no access to modern communication, technologies and academic resources. This spectrum also includes children with learning and developmental disabilities, mental and physical health issues and hostile home or school environments. Marginalization in the Global South places a significant portion of the children at an elevated risks of inequality from lack of access, knowledge and training of ICTs to digital exclusion. Moreover, the recent global pandemic has exacerbated these challenges. This workshop aims at tracing research lines and questions around methodological and technological in designing tools to support children on the margins in the Global South. ",

      "abstract": "While the body of research focusing on Intelligent Environments (IEs) programming by adults is steadily growing, informed insights about children as programmers of such environments are limited. Previous work already established that young children can learn programming basics. Yet, there is still a need to investigate whether this capability can be transferred in the context of IEs, since encouraging children to participate in the management of their intelligent surroundings can enhance responsibility, independence, and the spirit of cooperation. We performed a user study (N=15) with children aged 7-12, using a block-based, gamified AR spatial coding prototype allowing to manipulate smart artifacts in an Intelligent Living room. Our results validated that children understand and can indeed program IEs. Based on our findings, we contribute preliminary implications regarding the use of specific technologies and paradigms (e.g. AR, trigger-action programming) to inspire future systems that enable children to create enriching experiences in IEs.",

      "abstract": "An increasing trend of digitally enhancing learning provides unique opportunities to expand from local to global learning environments. However, current technologies and educational approaches do not adequately support creative communication and learning for primary school learners across the globe. We maintain that it is important to promote agentic engagement amongst learners by involving them in the design of their own digitally enhanced learning environment. In this study, we connected ten learners from a Namibian and a Finnish school in virtual communications to co-design an interactive map game. Following a research through design approach, we share a detailed account of the case study in which we facilitated a distributed co-design process, using Skype, a custom made VR environment, and Microsoft Whiteboard.\r\nWe reflect on the co-design sessions, focusing on communication and the design concept evolution  contributing to distributed co-design methods and techniques not only for the design community but also as an agentic learning process that could be incorporated into formal learning environments. With a paucity of existing empirical work of geographically distributed co-design with children, our case study provides an empirical foundation pointing at critical issues to be further investigated such as multilingual design, social cohesion, facilitation roles, technologies, design breadcrumbs, negotiations and learner's pride.

      "abstract": "Understanding the way different robot's strategies affect children's perceptions of social robots is crucial for a trustworthy child-robot relationship. This paper presents a preliminary study on whether motivational strategies based on Regulatory Focus Theory and goal attainment affect children's perception of a virtual social robot when solving a task. The ongoing pandemic (COVID-19) is altering the way we perform research. Hence, we designed a fully autonomous game with a virtual social robot. In an online user study, 25 children (8 to 17 years old) played a regulatory focus goal-oriented game with a virtual child-like version of the Furhat robot. We evaluated children's perceptions of the robot's social trust, competency trust, and likability. Also, we assessed the children's affective state (valence and arousal) before and after playing the game. Our preliminary results show that in the prevention condition, fulfilling the goal elicited less happiness in children. Surprisingly, we observed a trend increase in the social and competency trust elicited by the virtual robot when children were prevented from fulfilling the goal of the task. We discuss the results and the effects of online setups on conducting user studies with children. ",

For GCED, machine translation can be used as a tool to al low children to collaborate without a common language. However, low-resource language speakers often cannot enter the conversation and have difficulties in participating in a collaboration, because existing machine translations have poor trans lation quality in the low-resource languages. Messages from facilitators play an important role in encouraging children’s responses and participation. We, therefore, have analyzed the role of the facilitator in a real-world intercultural children workshop. Specifically, we examine actual conversation log data that links the facilitator’s utterances with children’s utterances in adjacency pairi ng. We annotate the paired data with tags and then statistically analyze the tagged data. The analysis results show that some types of facilitator messages can significantly impact the responses of low-resource language speaking children. For example, request type utterances tended to encourage responses.",

      "abstract": "With the proliferation of 3D printing technologies in schools and makerspaces, there is a need for teaching 3D modeling to students. Learning 3D modeling enhances spatial thinking skills, an essential skill for success in STEM. Creating 3D models requires students to have a deep understanding of 3D space, including rotating and scaling. In this study, we propose a framework developed through video-coding from analyzing screen recordings of middle-school students' usage of a 3D modeling tool - Tinkercad. The proposed framework focuses on identifying challenges students encounter during 3D modeling. These challenges include spatial thinking skills, working with the Tinkercad interface, and mental model formation. We authenticated the framework by collecting and analyzing data from a 3D printing unit in three middle schools. Our results and subsequent analysis can guide educators and researchers on how to use this framework to support students in having productive learning experiences with Computer-Aided Design tools.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the relation between children's joint gaze and emotions with the information flow of the screen from a causal point of view, in the context of collaborative coding. We employ Granger's definition of causality to extend the knowledge we have about children's collaborative activities from correlational methods. We organised a coding workshop with 50 children (10 dyads and 10 triads; 13-16 years old). While the children were coding collaboratively, their facial video and the screen were recorded. From the screen recording we computed the information flow; and from the facial video we computed children's emotions (e.g., frustration and boredom) and estimated their gaze. The gaze estimation was used to compute the joint visual attention (JVA) of the team. Our results show that for high performing teams JVA drives the information flow; while for low performing teams we observe causal relation between emotions and information flow. In particular for the low performing teams, frustration and boredom drive the information flow and the information flow then drives children's confusion. These results extend the understanding of the socio-cognitive processes underlying collaborative performance, which is primarily correlational in nature, with the causal relations between measurements. These novel results have the potential to guide the design of learning tools that scaffold children's learning and collaboration.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Bullying in schools is a widespread problem with serious consequences. We are exploring the use of social robots and role-playing to foster anti-bullying peer-support. In this paper, we present results from a co-design study with 22 preadolescent children to explore how they envision a \"student robot''. To understand how they conceptualize bullying in this context (e.g. whether robots can be bullied), we also investigated how they envision this robot's various social interactions. We prompted children to imagine a fictional robot about their age and follow a stepwise process to design the robot, and make stories about its interactions. Qualitative analysis of this study suggests themes of robots being described as highly-customizable characters with predominantly positive traits, that are imperfect. We also found that children can articulate various scenarios involving robots taking roles of bullies, victims, and bystanders. These findings contribute insights for designing pedagogical robots and anti-bullying interventions for children.",

There is a need to design novel technologies to further education in the arts and humanities. In its mission of preserving heritage locations, UNESCO has encouraged institutions, designers, and educators to raise awareness of cultural heritage through technology. This study will explore how PBAR can be designed to support students’ collaborative learning and engagement with the learning content. It will take architectural history and cultural heritage as the content domains for learning.  The research process will be informed by HCI and design methods, including participatory design of a PBAR system with students and educators. It intend to design, deploy and evaluate a novel PBAR environment in learning contexts (schools and universities). A range of data types and methods, including participant observation, open-ended interviews, take-home tasks, video analysis, and questionnaires, will be used to investigate the research question. Students’ impressions of and interactions with the novel system will be analysed to identify challenges and opportunities for PBAR to stimulate students’ interest and encourage their collaboration and engagement.

This paper introduces a baby care kit, ModHera, designed for parents to monitor their babies’ vital signs and adopt standard baby care practices. ModHera consists of three baby wearable modules: a shaken baby syndrome (SBS) prevention module, a respiration monitor, and a body temperature monitor module. A wearable wristband is developed for parents to receive the monitoring data and notifications generated by the baby wearable modules. Moreover, ModHera has an APP to record the monitoring data. Three scenarios were demonstrated to introduce the applications of ModHera, and user interviews were conducted to assess the usability of ModHera. The results show ModHera can assist parents in taking care of babies and help ease their burden of baby care.",

      "abstract": "Emotion expression in human-robot interaction has been widely explored, however little is known about how such expressions should be coupled with feelings and opinions expressed by a social robot. We explored how 12 children experienced \\textit{emotionally expressive social commentaries} from a reading companion robot across five interaction styles that differed in their non-verbal emotional expressiveness and opinionated conversational styles (neutral, divergent, or convergent opinions). We found that, while the robot's opinions and non-verbal emotion expressions affected children's experiences with the robot, the \\textit{speech content} of the commentaries was the more prominent factor in their experience. Additionally, children differed in their perceptions of social commentary: while some expressed a sense of connection-making with the robot's self-disclosure commentaries, others felt distracted by them or felt like the robot was off-topic. We recommend designers pay particular attention to the robot's speech content and consider children's individual differences in designing emotional and opinionated speech.",

      "abstract": "The online community plays a pivotal role in the transgender community. To better understand how gender-diverse youth equip online communities during their critical stage of gender identity development, we collected online postings from TrevorSpace, one of the most active forums among gender-diverse youth in the US. While existing HCI research largely focuses on the connectedness and social aspects of online communities, our findings illustrate how trans children use online communities to explore and navigate their gender identity. The thematic analysis reveals two conflicting ideas during this exploration, a desire to figure out whether their gender identity could be defined as trans, yet not to be defined through categorical classification of trans. More specifically, we found that 1) trans youth use the community to understand the changes happening in their gender identity by sharing their experience; 2) and these experiences vary for individuals in regards to the intensity of gender dysphoria and their coping mechanisms; 3) yet, the debate centers around the meaning of trans--for example, whether gender diverse youth should experience dysphoria or physically transition to be considered trans; 4) the growing impact of trans social influencers, particularly trans Youtubers, is pointed out as one of the sources that ignite the debate surrounding the categorical classification defining trans. Altogether, our findings point to the importance of acknowledging the spectrum of the trans experience to design a more inclusive digital platform for gender-diverse youth.",

It is, therefore, necessary to converge our collective efforts to broaden our understanding and perspectives of how virtual agents, affect and potentially improve the well-being of children.\r\n\"Children, Robots and Virtual Agents: Present and Future Challenges\" follows our International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR) 2020 workshop on child-robot interactions. In this full-day workshop, we will focus on the unique technical and empirical challenges of designing and conducting child-agent interactions. In light of the current pandemic situation, we will also address the challenges and adaptations of conducting research under the ``new normal\" to understand how researchers overcome these challenges and what we can learn and keep in the future. We also aim to join the virtual agents and robotics communities to learn from each other and discuss both areas' common and specific challenges.  \r\nOur primary goal is to provide an opportunity for an interdisciplinary debate about the present and future of child-agent interactions. We want to bring together researchers, practitioners and pioneers from relevant disciplines and create collaboration opportunities. \r\nAs part of the workshop, we will have a collaborative activity where our participants will work together and brainstorm about intelligent agents in different time frames (past, present and future). We will also have a panel of experts discussing the topics of this workshop and answering participants questions.  ",

      "abstract": "Based on a comprehensive account of digital design literacy, we report from an interview study with pioneer teachers to disclose their experiences from teaching design in formal K-9 education. Unique for the study is that the interviewees were highly qualified K-9 teachers with research-based in-service training in design and more than three years of teaching experience in the area. Our findings suggest that digital design literacy supports children’s agency and empowerment in relation to digital technology. Moreover, digital design literacy provides children with four broad competence areas of effective teamwork, contextual inquiry, imagination and creation, and design process navigation. Our study also demonstrates that digital design literacy does not fit seamlessly within the path of conventional school courses. Several structural barriers in formal education such as summative assessments, teacher-roles, failure-prevention and children’s lack of experiences with open-ended assignments are reported and discussed in relation to previous studies in child-computer interaction research.",

      "abstract": "Based on a systematic review we explore how empowerment has been articulated in 188 papers in Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) literature since 2003. Using an existing framework outlining functional, educational, democratic, mainstream, and critical empowerment, our analysis shows that while empowerment is rarely defined in CCI papers, a wide range of different articulations coexists. We explore the prevalence of different articulations in the literature and how this has shifted over time. We show that although empowerment has been part of the CCI discourse since the early days, a shift can be noticed in terms of how empowerment is articulated from an emphasis on empowerment in its functional meaning towards a more even distribution and the advent of critical articulations of empowerment. We conclude the paper by looking ahead into a new decade of CCI research and posing three questions to assist CCI researchers in more clearly articulating the nature and understanding of empowerment.",

      "abstract": "Within the broad range of the various types of chatbots, “bots of conviction” (BoCs) shift the focus from offering information to provoking reflection. In this paper we present the design of a “social” BoC, i.e. one designed to engage not one user but a group of participants in reflective dialogue, with the bot and each other. Our social BoC is designed as a digital experience to support history education for high school students (ages 14-18) and was evaluated with a total of 15 teenagers split into 5 groups. The goal was to assess the efficacy of our approach as a tool to promote historical empathy through dialogue. Our findings highlight the BoC’s role in engaging the students in constructive dialogue with each other; and the ways in which it guided perspective taking and collective reflection about the past, while at the same time foregrounding connections to the present",

      "abstract": "Developing the problem solving skills of children is a challenging problem that is crucial for the future of our society. Given that artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to solve problems across a wide variety of domains, AI offers unique opportunities to develop problem solving skills using a multitude of tasks that pique the curiosity of children. To make this a reality, it is necessary to address the uninterpretable ``black-box'' that AI often appears to be. Towards this goal, we design a \\textit{collaborative} artificial intelligence algorithm that uses a human-in-the-loop approach to allow students to discover their own personalized solutions to problems. This collaborative algorithm builds on state-of-the-art AI algorithms and leverages additional interpretable structures, namely knowledge graphs and decision trees, to create a fully interpretable process that is able to explain solutions in their entirety. We describe this algorithm when applied to solving the Rubik's cube as well as our planned user-interface and assessment methods.",

Besides the visuo-spatial cues provided by traditional number board games, learning companion robots can integrate multi-sensory information and offer social cues that can support children's learning experiences. We explored how young children experience sensory feedback (audio and visual) and social expressions from a robot when playing a linear number board game, \"RoboMath.\" We present the interaction design of the game and our investigation of children's (n=19, aged 4) and parents' experiences under three conditions: (1) visual-only, (2) audio-visual, and (3) audio-visual-social robot interaction. We report our qualitative analysis, including the themes observed from interviews with families on their perceptions of the game and the interaction with the robot, their child's experiences, and their design recommendations.",

      "abstract": "Therapist-operated robots can play a uniquely impactful role in helping children with autism practice and acquire social skills. While extensive research within Human-Robot Interaction has focused on teleoperation interfaces for robots in general, little work has been done on teleoperation interface design for robots in the context of therapy for children with autism. Moreover, while clinical research has shown the positive impact robots can have on children with autism, much of that research has been performed in a controlled environment, with little understanding of the way these robots are used in practice. We analyze archival data of therapists teleoperating robots as part of their regular therapy sessions, to (1) determine common themes and difficulties in therapists’ use of teleoperation interfaces, and (2) provide design recommendations to improve therapists’ overall experience. We believe that following these recommendations will help maximize the effectiveness of therapy for children with autism when using Socially Assistive Robotics and the scale at which robots can be deployed in this domain.",

Story Builder is a plug in for the Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP), a free, online, open-source drag-and-drop interactive data analysis system. Based on early prototyping conducted with several 7th grade classrooms, we sought to design a tool that would allow students to (a) integrate their data investigations with relevant personal and contextual information; (b) record the step-by-step process and rationale of their data analysis; and (c) reflect on and share these contextual and process-oriented elements of data analysis work with others. A major goal of Story Builder is to encourage students to consider and incorporate personal, social, and scientific considerations during data analysis.",

      "abstract": "Physical computing toolkits for children expose young minds to the concepts of computing and electronics within a target activity. To this end, these kits usually make use of a custom Visual Programming Language (or VPL) environment that extends past the functionality of simply programming, often also incorporating representations of electronics aspects in the interface. These representations of the electronics function as a scaffold to help the child focus on programming, instead of having to handle both the programming and details of the electronics at the same time. This paper presents a review of existing physical computing toolkits, looking at the What, How, and Where of electronics representations in their VPL interfaces. We then discuss potential research directions for the design of VPL interfaces for physical computing toolkits for children.",

      "abstract": "Children are increasingly surrounded by AI technologies but can overestimate smart devices’ abilities due to their lack of transparency. Drawing on the sense-making theory, this study explores how children come to see machine intelligence after training custom machine learning models and creating smart programs that use them. Through a 4-week observational study in after-school programs with 52 children (7 to 12 years old), we found that children engage in the scientific method while training, coding and testing their smart programs. We also found that children became more skeptical of certain abilities of smart devices as they shifted their attribution of agency from the devices to the people who program them. These changes in perception happened both through individual interactions with agents and prompted debates with peers. Based on these results, we conclude with discussions on strategies for promoting children’s sense-making practices and sense of agency in the age of machine learning.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Identifying and supporting children’s play and problem solving behaviour is important for designing educational technologies. This can inform feedback mechanisms to scaffold learning (provide hints or progress information), and assist facilitators (teachers, parents) in supporting children. Traditionally, researchers manually code video to dissect children’s nuanced play and problem solving behaviour.Advancements in sensing technologies and their respective Multi-Modal Data (MMD), afford observation of invisible states (cognitive, affective, physiological), and provide opportunities to inspect internal processes experienced during learning and play. However, limited research combines traditional video annotations and MMD to understand children’s behaviour as they interact with educational technology. To address this concern, we collected data from webcam, wristband, eye-trackers, and Kinect, as 26 children, aged 10-12, played a Motion-Based Educational Games (MBEG). Results showed significant differences in children’s experience during play and problem solving episodes, and motivate design considerations aimed to facilitate children’s interactions with MBEG.",

      "abstract": "Although specific design decisions are known to support Joint Media Engagement (JME; co-play with digital media) it is unclear whether current off-the-shelf tablet experiences are designed with this in mind and whether parents and children are able to engage in JME in practice. As apps that promote artistic creation (i.e., music, drawings) fulfill many extant design recommendations for JME, we observed joint play with two artistic creation apps in a culturally and socioeconomically diverse sample of 20 United States child-mother dyads. Using interaction analysis, we found that in these \"ideal\" circumstances, families used varying styles of co-engagement, with Co-Creation and Parent Coaching standing out as collaborative arrangements toward which designers and families can strive. However, there were still challenges, with parents often assuming spectator roles despite their apparent intentions. We highlight key challenges to JME plus design supports and parent strategies to help families jointly engage and create with media.",
