      "abstract": "Industrial Control Systems (ICS), vital for managing diverse industrial processes, face frequent security threats due to infrastructure vulnerabilities. Challenges such as multi-user access, logging procedures, and web-transmitted information security underscore design flaws balancing security and usability. To address this, we conducted a participatory study (N=18) pairing design and security experts to brainstorm interface design ideas, followed by reflective semi-structured interviews. Initial insights highlight tangible user interfaces (TUIs) as a solution to enhance security and user engagement. By integrating human-computer interaction and cybersecurity insights, we propose TUIs as a means to raise security awareness and facilitate proactive risk management, ensuring continuous energy supply and safeguarding critical infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "Though social media platforms contain rich information and insights on professional life, encounters with this content are often fleeting and disconnected, raising questions about the extent social media content is valuable for career identity formation. This paper reports on a research through design study that explores the potential of social media for supporting integrated learning experiences, through investigating and prototyping experiences around the use of TikTok #DayInTheLife videos for career exploration. We conducted semi-structured interviews of 10 college students to understand the value of social media content for career exploration and the feasibility of integrating such content towards reflective learning experiences. A qualitative analysis revealed that \\#DayInTheLife videos offer firsthand insights into professions that facilitates aspects of career identity formation, and have the potential to prompt and motivate further exploration. However, they are also limited due their short-form, disconnected, entertainment-oriented nature, the distracting context in which they exist, and the potential lack of representation in recommended content. We also had the students participate in an experience prototype in which we used native social media interactions such as comments, mentions, and direct messages to integrate encounters of disparate posts towards holistic and reflective learning experiences. We found that integrating encounters can facilitate more intentional reflection, add interactivity, and provide a sense of agency. We also surfaced contextual risk factors and design factors for designing integrated learning experiences on social media. We build on our findings to introduce and discuss a concept we call SIMPLE apps (Social media Interactions Merged for Purposeful Learning Experiences) and to discuss broader design implications for better harnessing social media content towards purposeful integrated learning.

However, real-world implementations of radiological AI-based systems are found to provide little to no clinical value. This paper explores how to design AI for clinical usefulness in different contexts. We conducted 19 design sessions and design interventions with 13 radiologists from 7 clinical sites in Denmark and Kenya, based on three iterations of a functional AI-based prototype. Ten sociotechnical dependencies were identified as crucial for the design of AI in radiology. We conceptualised four technical dimensions that must be configured to the intended clinical context of use: AI functionality, AI medical focus, AI decision threshold, and AI Explainability. We present four design recommendations on how to address dependencies pertaining to the medical knowledge, clinic type, user expertise level, patient context, and user situation that condition the configuration of these technical dimensions.",

Prior research introduced various software solutions for digital wellbeing. However, these digital solutions exist alongside excessively used apps, paradoxically requiring one to use more of their smartphones to reduce its problematic usage. We propose the concept of Kawach, tangible skins for smartphones to disguise them as everyday objects. By channelizing the smartphone's capabilities into a specific functionality, we aim to reduce distraction. This work focuses primarily on work-related activities and repurposes the smartphone as an object that enhances productivity. We realize our design approach based on the benefits of TUIs, the concept of design friction, and insights from soul-body prototyping. We showcase our concept through four artifacts.",

      "abstract": "Touch plays a vital role in social communication, bonding, and maintaining physical and emotional well-being. Advances in robotics alongside novel haptic technologies provide opportunities for tactile technology design that supports care, social bonding, and novel sensory experiences. However, the key to unlocking these potentials depends on whether a technology can ‘touch well’- whether the felt quality, or experiential affordance matches the expectation for the intended use cases. Current haptic devices are still very limited in the range and nuances of sensations that they can deliver, and there lacks the knowledge for developing richer and finer-grained sensations that encompass those of human social touch. To develop knowledge in this area requires cross-disciplinary collaborations. These challenges call for a formulation of a novel experience-driven design paradigm that brings together parameters from the expressive, affective, experiential and soma-aesthetic qualities of touch, as well as technical realisations and ethical dimensions. This workshop invites participants from diversified fields including but not limited to: design, material and bodily practices, social sciences, healthcare and artistic practices whose research interests and practices intersect with touch or haptics, touch interaction from robots and haptic devices to shape such a paradigm.

      "abstract": "Although Social Virtual Reality (SVR) affordances are designed to enable embodied social activities and interactions within virtual environments, the ways that users perceive and interpret these affordances can shape how SVR platforms are used and experienced. In this study, we examined the design and use of SVR affordances based on qualitative survey data from 100 SVR users. We observed that user practices diverge in important ways from intended designs, adding complexity to conventional interpretations of SVR platforms as embodied social environments. This research highlights dynamic user behaviour in which users interpret and reconfigure the affordances of SVR platforms, ranging from asocial use cases to actions that reflect the current limits of embodied communication. We contribute findings that may improve SVR design by revealing opportunities to foreground user needs and expectations, leveraging both the designed possibilities of SVR and the interpretations of those possibilities.

In this research-through-design project we investigate the use of a DGM for helping museum visitors explore the aesthetics of Edvard Munch's art. We designed and built an interactive drawing table that allows a user to explore a StyleGAN model trained on sketches by Edvard Munch. The paper makes two novel contributions: 1. It presents a system that allows users to interact with a DGM by drawing on paper (rather than the typical text prompts used by most current systems). 2. We demonstrate how this mode and quality of interaction establish a unique perspective on Munch's drawings as a practice. Through qualitative evaluation, we discuss how this setup led users towards a specific hermeneutic drawing strategy that enables building competency with the model and by proxy the data it is trained on. We suggest that the resulting interaction may contribute to an \"education of attention\" helping museum visitors to become attentive to certain visual qualities in Munch's drawing practice. Finally, we discuss how the concepts of technological mediation and relationality are useful for designing how the output of a DGM is understood by its users.",

In this paper, we investigate AI “hallucination” by stress-testing a visual storytelling algorithm with different visual and textual inputs designed to probe dream logic inspired by cinematic surrealism. Following a close reading of 100 visual stories that we deem artificial dreams, we describe how AI “hallucination” in computational visual storytelling is the opposite of groundedness: literary expression that is ungrounded in the visual or textual inputs. We find that this lack of grounding can be a source of either creativity or harm entangled with bias and illusion. In turn, we disentangle these obscurities and discuss steps toward addressing the perils while harnessing the potentials for innocuous cases of AI “hallucination” to enhance the creativity of visual storytelling.",

This study aims to explore the perspectives of individuals living with Parkinson's Disease regarding their needs and preferences in relation to data governance. We first conducted a survey (n=52) to explore the types of data people with Parkinson's generate through their self-care practices, and then conducted 3 workshops with 9 participants to understand their perspectives on the governance of this type of data. Through this work, we highlight the factors that motivate them to collect self-care data, and present their requirements for its governance, which could inform the design of future infrastructure to support these needs. We also showcase how speculative approaches can be used to engage communities in discussions around data collection and governance.",

This paper describes (a) the technical implementation of the CXR system, which geo-locates and orients the view of the participant within the moving vehicle; (b) the immersive digital twin tour, critically aligned with the real-life location; (c) our fallback system, which allows people who feel disoriented or motion-sick to continue along with the content of the tour. We validated the sense of communality, comfort, and effectiveness of the system through in-ride observation and post-ride surveys. Our intent is to enable the development of similar systems to foster communal engagement in communities worldwide.\r\n",

      "abstract": "In a long-term commitment to designing for the aesthetics of human–drone interactions, we have been troubled by the lack of tools for shaping and interactively feeling drone behaviours. By observing participants in a three-day drone challenge, we isolated components of drones that, if made transparent, could have helped participants\r\nbetter explore their aesthetic potential. Through a bricolage approach to analysing interviews, field notes, video recordings, and inspection of each team’s code, we describe how teams 1) shifted their efforts from aiming for seamless human–drone interaction, to seeing drones as fragile, wilful, and prone to crashes; 2) engaged with intimate, bodily interactions to more precisely probe, understand and define their drone’s capabilities; 3) adopted different workaround strategies, emphasising either training the drone or the pilot. We contribute an empirical account of constraints in shaping the potential aesthetics of drone behaviour, and discuss how programming environments could better support somaesthetic perception–action loops for design and programming purposes.",

      "abstract": "One common asset of metaverse is that users can freely explore places and actions without linear procedures. Thus, it is hard yet important to understand the divergent challenges each user faces when onboarding metaverse. Our formative study (N = 16) shows that first-time users ask questions about metaverse that concern 1) a short-term spatiotemporal context, regarding the user’s current location, recent conversation, and actions, and 2) a long-term exploration context regarding the user’s experience history. Based on the findings, we present PICAN, a Large Language Model-based pipeline that generates context-aware answers to users when onboarding metaverse. An ablation study (N = 20) reveals that PICAN's usage of context made responses more useful and immersive than those generated without contexts. Furthermore, a user study (N = 21) shows that the use of long-term exploration context promotes users’ learning about the locations and activities within the virtual environment.",

Recent technical advancements (\\eg large-language models (LLMs), program synthesis) offer various methods for automatically generating repair plans that address such conflicts. In this work, we understand how automated repair and explanations can be designed to improve user experience with robot failures through two user studies. In our first, online study ($n=162$), users expressed increased trust, satisfaction, and utility with the robot performing automated repair and explanations. However, we also identified risk factors---safety, privacy, and complexity---that require adaptive repair strategies. The second, in-person study ($n=24$) elucidated distinct repair and explanation strategies depending on the level of risk severity and type. Using a design-based approach, we explore automated repair with explanations as a solution for robots to handle conflicts and failures, complemented by adaptive strategies for risk factors. Finally, we discuss the implications of incorporating such strategies into robot designs to achieve seamless operation amid changing user needs and environments.",

Findings indicate the main functionalities of tracking data on eating behaviours, emotions, thoughts, bodily sensations, symptoms, as well as triggers of eating disorders, and of providing interventions such as mindfulness, goal setting, psychoeducation, CBT, and holistic ones. Findings also highlight key usability and ethical challenges, which we used to inform five design implications namely tracking and reflecting on multiple aspects of mindfulness and healthy eating, supporting personalized interventions and AI-based ones, as well as the sensitive design for diagnosis, and for tracking and monitoring problematic data.",

We identify the qualities of mechanical sympathy using the design case of How to Train your Drone, a unique human-drone research product designed to explore the process by which people discover and co-create the somaesthetic potential of drones. We articulate the qualities -- (i) machine-agency, (ii) oscillations, and (iii) aesthetic pursuits -- by using descriptive and reflective accounts of our design strategies and of our co-creators engaging with the system. We also discuss how each quality can extend soma design research; conceptualizing of appreciative, temporal, and idiosyncratic relationships with machines that can complement technical learning and enrich human-machine interaction. Finally, we ground our concept in a similar selection of works from across the HCI community.",

      "abstract": "For researchers at the intersection of health and human computer interaction, mobile AR presents a compelling platform for public health communication: it is increasingly available, highly customizable, and can present interactive visualizations of complex data. However, designers face challenges not only in adapting appropriate data and relevant public health metrics, but also in assessing their communicative potential and effectiveness for the target community. To contribute insight into this research area, we designed four mobile AR visualizations based on mental health issues and resources for our local university community. We then conducted a mixed-methods field experiment to investigate the impact of our AR visualizations on participants' awareness and understanding of pressing health issues, and to document barriers to use in this context. We show that our visualizations increased participants' sense of community connectedness and prompted them to reflect on their relationship with the university community. Based on these findings, we discuss opportunities for the field of human-computer interaction to further support public health communication.",

These platforms can contribute to a \\textit{dysfunctional fear of crime}, which undermines a person’s quality of life and mental health without actually making them feel safer. In this work, we conducted a mixed-methods study to understand the potential for design to foster a \\textit{functional fear of crime}, which motivates precaution without negatively impacting quality of life. We first interview individuals with a dysfunctional fear of crime and then validate interview results with a survey. Through this process, we identified five strategies for designers to support users in developing a more functional fear of crime. These strategies surface overarching theoretical and design implications for designers and researchers of safety platform with the ultimate goal of supporting safety, quality of life, and mental health for users of these platforms.",

This study evaluates a fictional AI dermatologist for assistance in the self-assessment of moles. Building on the Signalling Theory, we tested the effect of textual descriptions provided by a virtual dermatologist, as manipulated across 'Ability', 'Integrity,' and 'Benevolence', along with the clinical assessment, 'benign' or 'malignant', affect users' trust in the aforementioned trust pillars. Our study (N = 40) follows a 2 (Ability low/high) x 2 (Integrity low/high) x 2 (Benevolence low/high) x 2 (mole assessment benign/malignant) within-subject factorial design. Our results demonstrate that we can successfully influence perceptions of ability and benevolence by manipulating the corresponding aspects of trust but not perceived integrity. Further, in the case of a malignant assessment, participants' perception of trust increased across all aspects. Our results provide insights into the design of AI support systems for sensitive use cases, such as clinical self-assessments.",

Existing educational interventions and explainable AI (XAI) tools cater mainly to children or adult experts. In this paper, we present three interactive web-based tools to foster AI learning among adults without technical backgrounds. Designed according to learning sciences and user-centered design principles, these tools simplify complex AI concepts like edge detection, confidence thresholds, and sensitivity, making AI more understandable for beginners and facilitating reflection on ethical issues. We present results from a mixed-methods evaluation of the tools with 42 participants. Results show heightened familiarity and confidence in AI concepts. Our qualitative analysis additionally reveals common interaction patterns amongst participants. This paper offers both a design contribution to the AI education and XAI communities and emergent interaction patterns to support the design of transparent and learner-centered AI for adult novices.",

      "abstract": "Issues related to sexual health have been perceived as taboo for centuries across many cultures, yet social media platforms have changed the way that individuals approach these topics in our current day and age. In this provocation, we explore the implications of using memes to communicate information about taboos related to sexual health on TikTok. To begin, we explore what exactly a meme is and how TikTok functions as memetic platform. We then ponder the possibilities of using memes to discuss taboos on TikTok. Specifically, we consider how memes may aid in destigmatizing taboos, particularly related to sexual health and circumventing platform censorship, as well as how they are appropriated by corporations for advertising purposes. We end by speculating about using memes as both a design material and output on digital platforms.",

In this space, we will share our stories through the belongings and technologies we carry and discard, problematising nomadism and impermanence as possibilities for resilience and growth. Through the use of various design methods -including collaborative inventorying, somatic noticing and material fabulations- we will unpack together our experiences of mobility in academia, speaking about the objects and affects we embrace and leave behind, the role of technology in the construction of our changing identities, and possible futures we envision for nomadism.",

      "abstract": "Geometric motion-based visual feedback widely used in existing voice assistants (VAs) plays a significant role in voice interactions. It enables a real-time and simultaneous depiction of VAs’ conversational states, thereby mitigating the verbosity of speech and reducing unnecessary turn-taking. However, the study on VA visual feedback, which focuses on geometric motion graphics for different conversational states, has not been extensively explored. In this study, we systematically designed ‘Voicon’, shape-based visual feedback, and explored the expandability of its visual language. To achieve this, we determined 3 conversational states through a literature review. We then conducted a conjoint analysis using the visual attributes extracted from a participatory design workshop. Based on the results, we proposed the Voicon system and created video prototypes for qualitative evaluation. Our findings demonstrated that our Voicon system is intuitively understandable and perceived as useful by users. We believe this pictorial enriches and expands the design space of visual feedback for VAs, which facilitates voice interaction.",

      "abstract": "While mathematics is conventionally viewed as an abstract discipline, contemporary perspectives on embodied cognition underscore the significance of integrating students' bodily experiences into the learning process. However, the efficacy of embodied learning activities, as compared to traditional methods, remains under scrutiny. We argue that both directed and spontaneous bodily actions should be considered when designing embodied learning activities, and explore such bodily actions through two studies. A quantitative user study involving directed bodily actions in Virtual Reality and on tablet reveals VR's support for math-anxious and body-aware learners, and distinct movement patterns related to varying mathematical abilities. A subsequent qualitative analysis identifies key characteristics of spontaneous bodily actions, namely coarseness, muscle tension, repetitions, anchors, perspective, and metaphors. Derived from both studies, we propose design recommendations, advocating for expanded embodied interaction design, consideration of embodied metaphors, coarse gesturing for deep features identification, supporting of sense-making anchors, and in-VR learning assessments.",

These communities often share common materials, concepts, and techniques across related practices. However, due to their insular nature, exchanging knowledge between CoPs has been challenging, leading to fragmented knowledge marked by differing vocabularies and contexts. To address this issue, we introduce Anther, a system designed to highlight shared concepts and semantic overlap between distinct CoPs. Anther projects concepts onto a 2-dimensional space, providing users with comprehensive, contextual, and conceptual views. We conducted a user study, demonstrating Anther’s effectiveness in aggregating and disseminating community-based knowledge, bridging gaps between CoPs, and supporting the cross-pollination of knowledge between CoPs. Further, we present interaction vignettes that illustrate how Anther can ease entry into new domains and aide in discovering new creative techniques. This work can benefit maker communities by fostering collaborative knowledge-building across diverse domains.",

Rather than seek to mitigate biases perpetuated by datasets and automated systems, archival theory offers a reframing of bias itself. Drawing on a range of archival theory from the fields of history, literary and cultural studies, Black studies, and feminist STS, we propose absence—as power, presence, and productive—as a concept that might more securely anchor investigations into the causes of algorithmic bias, and that can prompt more capacious, creative, and joyful future work. This essay, in turn, can intervene into the technical as well as the social, historical, and political structures that serve as sources of bias.",

      "abstract": "We present ``Push-That-There'', an interaction method and system enabling multi-model object-level user interaction with multi-robot system to autonomously and collectively manipulate objects on tabletop surfaces, inspired by ``Put-That-There''. Rather than requiring users to instruct individual robots, users directly specify how they want the objects to be moved, and the system responds by autonomously moving objects via our generalizable multi-robot control algorithm. The system is combined with various user instruction modalities, including gestures, GUI, tangible manipulation, and speech input, allowing users to intuitively create object-level instruction. We outline a design space, highlight interaction design opportunities facilitated by ``Push-That-There'', and provide an evaluation to assess our system's technical capabilities. While other recent HCI research has studied interaction using multi-robot system (e.g. Swarm UIs), our contribution is in the design and technical implementation of intuitive object-level interaction for multi-robot system that allows users to work at a high level, rather than needing to focus on the movements of individual robots.

In interaction design, such ephemeral phenomena inspire the integration of transient features into interfaces to create unique user experiences. These interfaces generally foster ambient interactions, yet their potential in digital games remains relatively underexplored. We introduce ICY Interfaces—MeltPress, FrostPad, and IceSquish—gaming interfaces that utilize ice's playful ephemeral qualities to explore new dimensions in the digital game experience. Building on previous research, we conducted material exploration and a workshop with ice to investigate how its ephemerality benefits digital game interface design. Our findings from the playtest reveal how ice's physical disappearance influences gameplay interactions, its melting process enhances sensory experiences, and its unpredictability introduces engaging challenges. These results highlight the playful potential of ice in a digital game environment and underscore its role within the context of ephemeral materials and interfaces.",

      "abstract": "This essay proposes and explores the concept of Collage for the design of AI writing tools, which we transfer from avant-garde literature with four facets: 1) fragmenting text in writing interfaces, 2) juxtaposing voices (content vs command), 3) integrating material from multiple sources (e.g. text suggestions), and 4) shifting from manual writing to editorial and compositional decision-making, such as selecting and arranging snippets. The essay then employs Collage as an analytical lens to analyse the user interface design of recent AI writing tools, and as a constructive lens to inspire new design directions. Finally, a critical perspective relates the concerns that writers historically expressed through literary collage to AI writing tools. In a broad view, this essay explores how literary concepts can help advance design theory around AI writing tools. It encourages creators of future writing tools to engage not only with new technological possibilities, but also with past writing innovations.",

The practice of turning data into sound is dominated by approaches that prioritise analysis and algorithmic sound synthesis. This pictorial expands the boundaries of what is considered sonification by challenging existing conventions around what we can do with sonification, who gets to use sonification, why we sonify, what counts as valid data or valid sound, and the tools used to make sonifications. Alongside conventional sonification values such as insight and accuracy, we also value raw energy, expressiveness, polyphony, participation, decentralisation, performance, accessibility, approachability, community, and plurality of perspectives. The approaches we describe do not seek to replace established methods, but to enrich them. We contribute a set of values, examples and instructions for joining this movement, and reflections on how people working beyond sonification might benefit from these ideas. ",

This pictorial presents two successive Research through Design projects exploring practically how we might design with transactional data. The first, ‘FTML: Financial Transaction Mark-up Language’ is a speculative design project and short film, which explores how value-laden ‘mark up’ of specific transactional data could underpin new services and digital applications. The second, ‘Money / Data Laundering’ adopted an approach of ‘designerly hacking’, with Point of Sale (PoS) payment card readers, to develop a web application to digitally ‘wash’ or launder specific values into an indivdual’s bank account via a symbolic transaction. Reflecting on both interventions, we demonstrate the need, and opportunities, for designers to engage critically with transactional data and financial infrastructures, to enable new forms of value(s) exchange.",

We present AnimaTo, a multimorphic textile artefact designed for performativity that reacts to water exposure via the shrinking and dissolving of its fibres. Adopting a material-driven design approach, we engaged in material tinkering with these qualities to achieve changes in the texture, size, and shape of AnimaTo. Following this exploration, we conducted a pilot study to gain insights into AnimaTo’s temporal behaviour and performativity in use. In the further development of the artefact, we highlight the challenges that arise in producing high-fidelity prototypes. This work grants insights into how designers can tune material, form, and temporal qualities of textile artefacts towards multiplicity of use and prolonged user-textile relationships.",

The sonic feedback achieved through a snack storing device named Hicclip for verifying snacking behaviors and producing augmented eating sounds. The study was conducted with nine participants who were commonly addicted to snacking. The effectiveness of the sonification was examined by comparing snack-related data and questionnaire over the three study weeks: a baseline week, a Hicclip intervention week, and a post-intervention week. We also analyzed interview results to understand user experiences and opportunities for future research. Quantitative results showed that the snacking pattern has been improved due to reduced eating duration and snack consumptions. Qualitative results suggested that Hicclip may benefit self-regulation, afford easy adoption, and support data acquisition. We discuss design implications for embodiment of augmented eating sounds for healthy snacking.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents Robots for Distant Musicians (RFDM), a project developed as part of a residency at the MICA Game Lab in Baltimore, Maryland in 2020-21. A set of musically responsive robots were built that could be accessed through existing online communication platforms, enabling their control from anywhere in the world. This resulted in a series of playful interactions which revealed underlying tensions in the systems that the world came to depend upon during the pandemic. I propose to bring several of the robots from this project to the DIS Playful Experiences Demotrack, allowing users both locally and from around the world to control them through musical sound. ",

      "abstract": "Cognitive screening in hospitalized older patients is a critical, yet time-consuming process. While conversational agents present a promising solution to aid clinicians, current models fall short in their ability to scaffold questions to accommodate patients with potential cognitive decline effectively. To bridge this gap, we conducted a study with 13 clinicians to identify effective scaffolding strategies empirically. Our findings revealed six key strategies that clinicians use to scaffold the Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) in practice, together with the underlying rationale and potential challenges. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of conversational agents to assist in cognitive screening and propose design considerations for future research.",

Interaction will increasingly happen on the go, causing I/O to become constrained, ultimately leading to reliance on user intent prediction for aid. In this pictorial, we argue that to support the development of such systems, new predictive UI toolkits are required. We place the reader in the shoes of an App designer and outline the challenges that will be faced. We then describe a new predictive toolkit, leveraging Fuzzy Widgets, or “Fidgets” as the main UI building block. Fidgets extend Responsive Design into the realm of intelligent systems, to adapt not only to spatial constraints, but to system predictions as well. We then describe a working implementation of a predictive music application, built using our described framework, showcasing its benefits and range of adaptive abilities.​",

To explore GAI's adoption and appropriation in design, an interview-based study probed 10 specialists in user experience and industrial design, with varying tenure and GAI experience, for their adoption/application of GAI tools, reasons for not using them, problems with ownership and agency, speculations about the future of creative work, and GAI tools' roles in design sensemaking. Insight from reflexive thematic analysis revealed wide variation in attitudes toward GAI tools -- from threat-oriented negative appraisals to identification of empowerment opportunities -- which depended on the sense of agency and perceived control. The paper examines this finding in light of the Coping Model of User Adaptation and discusses designers' metacognitive skills as possible underpinnings for their attitudes. Avenues for further research are identified accordingly.",

However, because harassment is highly contextual and personal, designing effective solutions to this problem can be extremely challenging. This paper examines how harassment-mitigation systems studied in human-computer interaction (HCI) consider victim-centered principles in their design. Through a scoping literature review and close reading of 17 papers, we contribute—(1) a characterization of how novel and existing systems consider victims' identity characteristics, definitions of harassment, and preferred strategies for dealing with harassment; (2) challenges faced by the systems along these dimensions to surface limitations, gaps, and tensions; (3) practical recommendations for researchers, designers, and practitioners to overcome these challenges. In doing so, we offer potential new directions to positively design computational approaches to addressing online harassment with victim-centered principles in mind.",

      "abstract": "Airbnb is well known for providing guests with local experiences by regular people worldwide. Many pioneer hosts experiment with emerging smart products to improve guests' experiences. However, these initial efforts often merely provide functionality, neglecting to offer guests authentic experiences motivated by hosts' authenticity. We addressed this gap by using bespoke design methods to understand hosts' stories and co-develop interaction concepts that can express their authenticity and fit their Airbnb. We implemented a set of Digital Concierges (DCs) and deployed them in a real Airbnb to investigate guests' experiences. Our results show that our design enhanced guests' sense of welcome, fostered their discovery with serendipitous cues, and built richer connections with the host and locals. We concluded with the design implications of co-designing artifacts to embody hosts' authenticity and use multiple modalities to enhance perceived authentic experiences. Most importantly, we shared our insights about working with hosts as co-creators.",

However, many such visions just reinforce the existing unsustainable industrial production paradigm. Since smallholder farms continue to produce most of thew world's food, we ask in this work-in-progress: What can we learn from them about the design of appropriate and responsible digital farming technologies? We report tentative findings from an ongoing engagement with smallholder farmers in Northern England, UK. We present six tensions related to the relationship between technology and farming practices and the nature of technologies themselves. We develop a set of values for design for nature-friendly and community-based smallholder agriculture and propose three unfinished evocative design speculations, which we plan to develop further and use in co-design work with farmers going forward.",

      "abstract": "Reading and repeatedly retelling a short story is a common and effective approach to learning the meanings and usages of target words. However, learners often struggle with comprehending, recalling, and retelling the story contexts of these target words. Inspired by the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, we propose a computational workflow to generate relevant images paired with stories. Based on the workflow, we work with learners and teachers to iteratively design an interactive vocabulary learning system named RetAssist. It can generate sentence-level images of a story to facilitate the understanding and recall of the target words in the story retelling practices. Our within-subjects study (N=24) shows that compared to a baseline system without generative images, RetAssist significantly improves learners’ fluency in expressing with target words. Participants also feel that RetAssist eases their learning workload and is more useful. We discuss insights into leveraging text-to-image generative models to support learning tasks.",

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) designers need practical methods to address it. In this paper, we explore whether systemic modeling could help designers understand and mitigate these rebound effects. Drawing on systemic design and system dynamics, we prototyped a collaborative modeling methodology that ten professional designers applied to a case study in two workshops. We share insights on their adoption of the methodology and their feedback on its usefulness, usability, and feasibility. Our results indicate that designers find the systemic modeling approach relevant and useful for addressing rebound effects. Influence diagrams can help structure design ideas and identify unaddressed points, while dynamic modeling can help compare design strategies. Based on these findings, we propose a framework for integrating this approach into a design process.",

      "abstract": "Generative AI tools can provide people with the ability to create virtual environments and scenes with natural language prompts. Yet, \\textit{how} people will formulate such prompts is unclear---particularly when they inhabit the environment that they are designing. For instance, it is likely that a person might say, ``Put a chair here,'' while pointing at a location. If such linguistic and embodied features are common to people's prompts, we need to tune models to accommodate them. In this work, we present a Wizard of Oz elicitation study with 22 participants, where we studied people's implicit expectations when verbally prompting such programming agents to create interactive VR scenes. Our findings show when people prompted the agent, they had several implicit expectations of these agents: (1) they should have an embodied knowledge of the environment; (2) they should understand embodied prompts by users; (3) they should recall previous states of the scene and the conversation, and that (4) they should have a commonsense understanding of objects in the scene. Further, we found that participants prompted differently when they were prompting \\textit{in situ} (i.e. within the VR environment) versus \\textit{ex situ} (i.e. viewing the VR environment from the outside). To explore how these lessons could be applied, we designed and built Ostaad, a conversational programming agent that allows non-programmers to design interactive VR experiences that they inhabit. Based on these explorations, we outline new opportunities and challenges for conversational programming agents that create VR environments.",

      "abstract": "The way consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices are built is leading to electronic waste (eWaste) growth. This arises from planned obsolescence, bundling of ‘smartness’ creating more routes to device failure, and lacking hardware modularity and repairability. Understanding how best to tackle these issues requires an interdisciplinary perspective bridging design, law, and the social science research. The legal landscape is shifting, encouraging design of repairable and long-lasting IoT, and reducing routes to redundancy. This one-day workshop explores the interface between design and legal research to address the socio-technical challenges around designing sustainable consumer IoT devices. The workshop will: map out the societal, legal, and environmental implications of IoT; envision the opportunities and barriers to designing more sustainable IoT; and share best practice and tools how to move towards more sustainable IoT futures.",

In this exploratory research-through-design project, we aimed to physicalize data on-the-go using a portable digital fabrication device, and gathered community annotations and traces of the journey the machine went on with “stitch markers”. We describe the development of The Life of a Small Town, a portable knitting machine that was adapted to knit rows of stitches in response to sensor data. The machine travelled throughout a small town and “popped up” at local art events to sense and physicalize social gatherings held by an arts organization over the period of one year. Individuals participating in events could also decorate their own “stitch markers” to annotate and pin to the data. In this paper we discuss the insights from an analysis of the stitch markers and traces of the year-long journey.",

Our work provides a thick description of compiling an agonistic data practice that studies up, fleshing out the conception brought forth by previous scholars. We describe this project's planning, implementation, results, and challenges to demonstrate how designing data production can affect fairness and accountability in the courtroom. From our account, we offer insights for scholars wishing to contribute to data activism projects: focus on designing data production not data products, shift epistemic burdens onto those who may benefit more from the data, and to look for affective potential within messy data.",

In this paper, we explore opportunities for combining the maker cultures of hand spinning with e-textile crafting. In our first study, we interviewed 32 hand spinners on their practices to better understand their motivations for spinning their own yarns and the techniques they use to do so. In our second study, we conducted workshops with 6 spinners at a local spinning guild, where participants worked with the conductive fibers and spun e-textile yarns. After the workshops, we conducted follow-up interviews with each participant to understand the opportunities and tensions of hand spinning e-textile yarns. Our findings show how spinners can blend local materials with conductive ones to develop their own custom interactive textiles, and the mismatch between how these fibers are sold and what information spinners require to inform their design decisions. Through these results, we hope to empower makers and inspire the design community to develop tools to support these DIY practices. ",

An initial needfinding study (N=8) using video vignettes revealed older adults' experiential needs for robot-mediated remote experiences such as exploration, reminiscence and social participation. We then designed a prototype system to support these goals and conducted a technology probe study (N=11) to garner a deeper understanding of user preferences for remote experiences. The study revealed user interactive patterns in each desired experience, highlighting the need of robot guidance in exploration and social engagements for reminiscence. Our work identifies a novel design space where conversational telepresence robots can be used to foster meaningful interactions in the remote physical environment. We offer design insights into the robot's proactive role in providing guidance and using dialogue to create personalized, contextualized and meaningful experiences. ",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an autoethnography of 3 years of learning to play the theremin, an instrument lacking tangible feedback. While the theremin is typically invoked in HCI to emphasize the importance of the tactile modality, we interrogate how I, the player, attained musical proficiency without touch.\r\n\r\nThrough a thematic analysis of 235 journal entries, our study distills my strategies for navigating the instrument as well as my personal transformations along the way. We discover that without touch, accurate and musical playing on the theremin relies on continuous auditory feedback, proprioception, and imaginative processes. We discuss challenges and opportunities for embodied and tangible interaction in light of these findings.",

Departing from traditional interface design, MBD prioritizes natural interaction, SportsHCI, and health promotion through physical activity. This paradigm shift has led to innovations in experimental applications and interaction techniques, including exergames, expressivity in interactions and soma-design. Various guidelines and frameworks have been proposed for specific purposes, from sports to virtual reality. This workshop explores participants' experiences and perspectives on MBD, delving into MBD workshop design and reflect on MBD methods and the current move towards MBD methodologies.",

      "abstract": "Collaboration in distributed mixed reality (MR) creates co-presence illusions by bringing a digital representation of the remote collaborator into the local user's physical space. However, constraints in each physical environment, such as different spatial layouts and furniture, can hinder collaboration and momentarily breaks the illusion of co-location. Since the remote user's physical space is invisible to the local user, the source of the interaction problem is often imperceptible, leading to familiar real-world interactions suddenly feeling unfamiliar---a concept we term the Jamais Vu Effect. In this paper, we conceptualise and demonstrate this effect through a five-part user study that elicits the user experience of the Jamais Vu Effect in MR. We contribute a shared vocabulary and understanding of spatial interface design challenges to help designers and researchers discuss and improve distributed collaboration in MR.",

We report two studies: Study 1, a quasi-experimental field study, with 247 participants divided into voice-based (N=83), text-based (N=81), and choice (N=83) conditions. Study 2 uses semi-structured interviews (N=16) to explore perceptions of the interaction paradigms in-depth. Results from the first study revealed a general preference for text, though voice users produced longer responses and more topic-related keywords. Over time, the preference for voice increased among students, from 10% to 46%, when given a choice. Study 2 suggested that factors like social presence contribute to hesitance toward voice-based explanations, with a cognitive load, self-confidence, and performance anxiety also influencing medium preferences. Our findings highlight design recommendations and demonstrate the potential of voice-based self-explanations in educational settings, indicating that mixed interfaces might better meet diverse needs.",

However, the User Interface (UI) presented in a video tutorial may differ from the learner's UI because of customizations or differences in software versions. We investigate the frictions resulting from such differences on a learners' ability to reproduce a task demonstrated in a video tutorial. Through a morphological analysis, we first identify 13 types of \"interface differences\" that differ in terms of availability, reachability and spatial location of features in the interface. To better assess the frictions resulting from each of these differences, we then conduct a laboratory study with 26 participants instructed to reproduce a vector graphics editing task. Our results highlight interesting UI comparison behaviors, and illustrate various approaches employed to visually locate features.",

Their needs are often not adequately considered in the design of general platforms and they can be exposed to intra-community harms on LGBTQ+ specific platforms such as dating apps. To explore how social platform design could be improved to better support the needs of queer young men, we conducted a co-design study. We recruited 13 queer men working in technology design to generate new concepts for social platform features. We then refined these concepts and evaluated them in group sessions with end users, a different cohort of 15 queer young men. Here we present mockups of the concepts and findings from evaluations. Our findings show specific ways that providing more agency to social platform users could improve their experiences and we discuss implications for design.",

Despite a recent upswing in interventions for enabling more ethical technology design, however, there is little empirical evidence on which strategies work and why. In this review and provocation, we detail how research on the psychology of belief and behavior change can help shift ethical culture within technology design teams, organizations, and the industry more broadly. We suggest three approaches, each supported by empirical evidence: (1) questioning intuitive assumptions, (2) highlighting system complexity, and (3) targeting social and organizational structures. Crucially, these three approaches rely on both individual and social approaches, and we propose that effective strategies will make use of the interdependence between individuals’ beliefs and their social behavior to change the broader culture of ethical technology design. We provide nine suggestions that teams and organizations can implement to foster more ethical behavior and conclude with next steps.",

These teasers enable long-form podcasters to reach new audiences and gain more followers. However, creating a compelling teaser from an hour-long episode can be challenging. Selecting interesting clips requires significant mental effort; editing the chosen clips into a cohesive, well-produced teaser is time-consuming. To support the creation of video podcast teasers, we first investigated what makes a good teaser. We combined insights from audience comments and creator interviews to identify key ingredients. We also identified a common workflow used by creators during this process. Based on these findings, we developed a human-AI co-creative tool called PodReels to assist video podcasters in crafting teasers. Our user study demonstrated that PodReels significantly reduces creators' mental demand and improves their efficiency in producing video podcast teasers.",

In response, this paper advocates for the articulation of the felt sense -or tacit knowledge residing in our bodies- as a viewpoint for noticing. Assisted by micro-phenomenological interviews, we carefully described our felt senses from our experiences with a telepresence robot and smartphone photography. We illustrate how this viewpoint allowed us to access our pre-judgemental dimension, the vivid liveliness in our experiences with technologies, and the porosity of our sense of self. We contribute the felt sense as a viewpoint for noticing to design researchers interested in integrating their somatic sensibilities into their work with the more-than-human, allowing them to attune to, describe and share with other researchers the normally unattended dimension of our experiences, including aspects concerning the felt dimension of ethics.",

      "abstract": "Searching for Us is a pervasive tangible narrative that integrates physical avatars, real-time data such as weather or traffic, and a non-linear, multiplayer narrative. It uses marionette-like avatars and RFID-tagged props to create a pervasive narrative experience that blurs the boundaries between physical and digital aspects of the story. The narrative can dynamically adjust through a server-based system, offering unique story fragments based on user interactions and environmental factors. By fostering performative interaction and collaborative storytelling, Searching for Us aims to deepen engagement with friendship, loyalty, and resilience themes. This experience aims to expand traditional interactive storytelling by encouraging users to engage with urban spaces and create dynamic narrative trajectories, ultimately seeking to offer a more meaningful and immersive storytelling experience.",

      "abstract": "We present phenology circles, a method to deepen relations human and more-than-human in the backstage of participatory design processes. To illustrate the method, we reflect on over two years of activity in an online, global gardening community of practice (our phenology circle) initiated to coordinate and communicate with participants in the backstage of our research. Related to our research aims, the community was initiated to attune ourselves to the rhythms and interrelations of other species and between one another. Through this approach, we better understood interaction and deepened relations between humans and the more-than-human (e.g., plants, animals, spirits). The community (N=42) has shared over 1,200 images and textual posts regarding thoughts about the environment, concerns, and experiences. Reflecting on activity of eight core members, we identified shifts from scientific-natured posts to imbue sentience and storytelling, making possible a variety of cross-cultural and symbiotic encounters to appear in our online site and fostering community to encounter and embrace difference. Phenology circles illuminate more-than-human concerns intertwined with different human values and beliefs. We discuss the value of science, sentience and storytelling, reflect on facilitation, and illustrate a design pathway that links the backstage to frontstage design activities.",

      "abstract": "Data donation is an emerging practice for collecting personal data. However, recent data donation approaches are insufficient in intimate research contexts as they perceive data as neutral and objective and do not consider the contexts where data is generated and shaped nor offer choices beyond whether to disclose data. In this paper, we investigate how Data Feminism can inform an alternative form of data donation and propose the Sensitive Data Donation (sDD) method. It recognizes the sensitive nature of data and assumes the importance of situating and contextualizing it through balanced participation from donors, either as contributors, collaborators, or co-creators. To develop the method, we conduct a scoping literature review where we conceptualize data donation theories and practices. These serve as a base to critique recent approaches and propose an alternative: sDD. It comprises five principles integrated into a five-phase approach. We conclude by discussing its limitations and future challenges.",

Catalyzed by cultural probes, residents (1) shared the diverse strategies and know-how involved in making themselves comfortable, (2) offered arguments for their everyday futures, and (3) explained what we can learn from them. A first tentative definition of energy interfaces opens the door to what we consider interfaces, how they support developing know-how and how they co-construct everyday practices. Residents’ resourceful solutions elicit reflections on what is considered valid participation in the energy transition. From the findings, we synthesize alternative starting points for the design of energy interfaces: We outline design opportunities to expand the (un)comfortable by revisiting comfort as fluid and multi-sensory. Furthermore, we sensitize how design can build on residents’ existing strategies for making comfortable, rather than replace them.",

However, despite its popularity, learning group dance routines remains challenging. Based on the prior success of interactive systems to support individual dance learning, this paper argues that group dance settings are fertile ground for augmentation by interactive aids. To better understand these design opportunities, this paper presents a sequence of user-centered studies of and with amateur cheerleading troupes, spanning from the formative (interviews, observations) through the generative (an ideation workshop) to concept validation (technology probes and speed dating). The outcomes are a nuanced understanding of the lived practice of group dance learning, a set of interactive concepts to support those practices, and design directions derived from validating the proposed concepts. Through this empirical work, we expand the design space of interactive dance practice systems from the established context of single-user practice (primarily focused on gesture recognition) to a multi-user, group-based scenario focused on feedback and communication.",

      "abstract": "Health misinformation, defined as health-oriented information that contradicts empirically supported scientific findings, has become a significant concern on social media platforms. In response, platforms have implemented diverse design solutions to block such misinformation or alert users about its potential inaccuracies. However, there is limited knowledge about users' perceptions of this specific type of misinformation and the actions that are necessary from both the platforms and the users themselves to mitigate its proliferation. This paper explores social media users' (n = 22) perceptions of health misinformation. On the basis of our data, we identify specific types of health misinformation and align them with user-suggested countermeasures. We point to the critical demands for anti-misinformation solutions for health topics, emphasizing the transparency of information sources, immediate presentation of information, and clarity. Building on these findings, we propose a series of design recommendations to aid the future development of solutions aimed at counteracting misinformation.",

      "abstract": "3D printing generally makes use of CAD software and slicers to mediate designerly intentions and fabrication instructions to the machine. This can obstruct the making process to such a degree that the designer risks becoming an observer of an ongoing print. To trouble this situation, we devised a manual control that enables the designer to manipulate one of the axes of the 3D printer. Through this embodied process, the incoming toolpath becomes another material to be extruded together with the 3D printing filament. The negotiations of (im)precision and intent between designer and machine are recorded and can be used as input for a new beginning. In this pictorial, we share our annotated 3D prints as a way of highlighting and paying attention to the relations between code, material, machine, and designer. We contribute with the system and reflections on embodied fabrication.",

      "abstract": "As technology continues to advance, the interaction between humans and cats is becoming more diverse. Our research introduces a new tool called the AI Cat Narrator, which offers a unique perspective on the shared lives of humans and cats. We combined the method of ethnography with fictional storytelling, using a \\textit{defamiliarization} strategy to merge real-world data seen through the eyes of cats with excerpts from cat literature. This combination serves as the foundation for a database to instruct the AI Cat Narrator in crafting alternative narrative. Our findings indicate that using defamiliarized data for training purposes significantly contributes to the development of characters that are both more empathetic and individualized. The contributions of our study are twofold: 1) proposing an innovative approach to prompting a reevaluation of living alongside cats; 2) establishing a collaborative, exploratory tool developed by humans, cats, and AI together.",

In a mixed-methods study with Bangladeshi women (n=23), we explored their safety issues, including sexual harassment and assault, to inform AV design, especially for shared rides. Our focus group findings revealed women's distressing experiences of abuse and undertaken safety measures in public transport of Global South. We conducted co-design sessions utilizing virtual reality (VR) scenarios and investigated participants' perceptions of potential AV designs addressing unique safety concerns and transportation challenges. Participants suggested prioritizing their own safety, achieved through design justice of equitable AV, over the current, often ineffective, retributive justice. Our work contributes to AV design, ICTD, and feminist HCI by suggesting implications for designing community-based and culturally contextual transportation infrastructure for Bangladeshi women and similar other communities.",

However, approaches such as citizen-centered design and digital civics bring these design methods to bear on the development of digital technologies in support of civic and third sector organizations in particularly complex and rapidly changing socio-technical landscapes. Such endeavors frequently need to engage marginalized, under-served and hard to reach communities. In these design spaces, the ‘Digital Citizen’ becomes a contested concept, deserving of deeper exploration. In this one-day workshop we seek to bring together the DIS community, industry practitioners and third sector representatives to mutually explore the concept of the digital citizen, its boundaries and opportunities, and in response to a rapidly changing environment of smart digital services, the ways in which design methods might be evolved to better support designing for and with these digital citizens.",

Exploring possibilities of meeting the widely differing goals of patients and their healthcare professionals led to designing a personalise-able method for creating comics. Through ongoing discussions during the comic creation process, we explored variations in comic styles and personalisation factors such as choosing and modifying the appearance of the comic personalities, the settings, the central topics, and word usage to create the comics. Interest in using the approach that supports the creation of medical comics was high among patients and healthcare professionals. Rich feedback was obtained about information to be included and future direction for such medical comic creation support. We reflect on lessons learned during co-design with healthcare givers and patients.",

In this late-breaking work, we describe the design and deployment of ‘Rocket React’ (Fig. 1), a configurable language learning application designed as a social, performative game for classrooms. The novel approach to ‘socialifying’ language learning applications we propose does not import features from social software, or encourage social learning interactions to happen within the application (e.g. through chat or game mechanics); rather, this approach makes use of the social and physical setting of the classroom as constituent elements of the design. Some of the observable social consequences of this approach included previously unrealized opportunities (with web apps) for co-located collaboration on a shared language task, ‘out loud’ classroom social interactions, and vicarious (spectator) participation and learning in the classroom.",

This creates monumental possibilities of automation and accessibility of computing, but also raises severe security and safety threats: When everyone can interact with LLMs, everyone can potentially break into the systems running LLMs. All it takes is creative use of language. This paper presents Hacc-Man, a game which challenges its players to “jailbreak” an LLM: subvert the LLM to output something that it is not intended to. Jailbreaking is at the intersection between creative problem solving and LLM security. The purpose of the game is threefold: 1. To heighten awareness of the risks of deploying fragile LLMs in everyday systems, 2. To heighten people’s self-efficacy in interacting with LLMs, and 3. To discover the creative problem solving strategies, people deploy in this novel context.",

It proposes a decision map to help determine whether it is ethical or appropriate to design a product or system for behavior intervention. Through the lens of neurodiversity, this work considers how designs for behavior intervention often mirror techniques utilized in behavioral therapies aimed at preserving neurotypical social expectations at the expense of individual autonomy. This pictorial also examines devices used for behavior intervention through photographs of existing products and technologies that support self-stimulatory behaviors (stimming). It utilizes a fictional narrative with digital illustrations and AI-generated imagery to explore the impact of an imagined technology designed to modify the behavior of neurodivergent individuals. “Fidgets” are presented as a product exemplar that supports and celebrates self-determined, intuitive behaviors rather than suppressing or modifying behaviors to conform to social norms.",

In this provocative paper, we present the Eudaimonic User Experience (EUX) and its design rules and artifacts that we have derived based on previous work from HCI and psychology. The design rules are primarily intended to serve as a basis for discussing the possibility of focusing on alternative design beyond the current doctrines of simplicity, gradualism, and ease of use, which could be more human-centered than the aforementioned principles.",

      "abstract": "Bodily augmentations have been increasingly investigated by HCI researchers due to the associated benefits, such as accessibility, offering novel input space, and sensing environment. Most of these investigations have adopted a utilitarian perspective, providing impairment, mobility, and rehabilitation support. However, more recently, a subset called bodily extensions has emerged that appears to also embrace experiential aspects. These bodily extensions physically extend the human body, going beyond traditional sensing and accessibility perspectives. Initial designs were mostly rigid, leading to a focus on short-term use, missing out on the opportunities for these bodily extensions to be integrated into everyday life. In our work, we build soft pneumatic-based bodily extensions that users can incorporate into their everyday lives. We detail the design and rationale behind these bodily extensions, along with the novel scenarios they enable. We share our insights from creating these systems and the associated user experiences from our field study with 48 participants, resulting in a design framework that will hopefully aid future designers in facilitating embodiment across everyday life through bodily extensions.",

The authors employ a qualitative research design rooted in reflexive thematic analysis for this project, with methods including a series of semi-structured interviews and an analysis of digital content produced by grassroots climate justice groups. We identify five distinct functions of data which support the work of local climate activists. These functions highlight how engagement with data in this context is intertwined with autonomy, affect and the reframing of what counts as climate data and expertise. This study contributes to further understanding of the relationship between grassroots climate justice groups and data practices, highlights barriers groups face with data engagement, and offers recommendations for HCI to further support local climate action.

This paper explores Socially Engaged Art (SEA) as one such practice, which uses dialogical inquiry to address social justice issues. We describe a case study of SEA-informed digital storytelling workshops in a rurban community in Ireland. The workshops aimed to support diverse adolescent participants in identifying and critiquing place-based social issues with a view to imagining alternative and inclusive futures. SEA was instrumental in uncovering contradictory and hidden experiences of community life. We propose incorporating SEA into design processes to: i) challenge assumptions around identity and belonging; ii) recognise diverse experiences; and iii) breakdown social-engagement barriers. As we ask questions on what design is for, who should design, and why design matters, SEA can centre marginalised experiences, support polyvocal participation and help develop participant agency to work towards more equitable futures in rapidly changing environments.",

      "abstract": "Digital artists use generative systems for negotiating agency and control with autonomous processes that display emergent and self-organizing behavior. Practitioners have started using these systems in material fabrication for rich sensory opportunities; however, translating digital generative designs into the physical involves significant knowledge of programming, complex workflows, physical constraints, and material properties. I aim to develop computational systems bridging generative art methods with digital fabrication techniques to support artistic practices. I seek to develop digital generative workflows that account for the complexities of real-world materials through collaborations with professional practitioners. My thesis contributes practice-based research into evolutionary algorithms for real-time digital form generation, a manual-computational workflow for artistic production that moves between digital and material pipelines, and a collaborative practice-driven software development methodology for digital fabrication. These contributions inform my next project aiming to bridge the gap between digital and physical workflows, bringing computational generative design closer to material fabrication.",

Yet, current privacy labels fail to fully reflect the impact of advanced device configuration options like sensor state control. Based on the successful implementation of related privacy and security labels, we designed extended static and interactive labels that reflect sensor states and device connectivity. We first did expert interviews (N=10) that informed the final label design. Second, we ran an online survey (N=160) to assess the interpretation and usability of the novel interactive privacy label. Lastly, we conducted a second survey (N=120) to investigate how well our interactive labels educate users about sensor configuration. We found that most participants successfully used the interactive label and retrieved sensor information more efficiently and correctly. We discuss our findings in the context of a potential shift in label use toward control and use-case-based interaction.",

      "abstract": "We present a retrospective autoethnography grounded in data-driven design. The first author collected her movement data and subjective experience of learning the dance repertoire of modern dance pioneer Isadora Duncan, which together were encoded into the design of a set of plaster artefacts physicalising her embodied dance learning progression. The artefacts reflect the first author's bodily transformation, mirroring her transition from discomfort to ease, and changes in her expressive capabilities. Our method offers an alternative to documentation of embodied learning through design. Throughout our design process we leverage on the movement data, the field notes and the first author's memory of her journey, all of which constitute entangled and complementary input into her experience of dance learning. We show that the data physicalisations provided a gateway into the intangible experience and allowed for a deep and reflexive understanding of our dataset.",

Most research primarily addresses the challenges gig workers encounter on digital platforms, yet practical aspects such as infrastructural and environmental factors often receive insufficient attention. Additionally, there is a significant lack of HCI and design methods for engaging with platform designers, which could limit the research's ability to influence real-world worker practices. My doctoral study employs comprehensive HCI and design approaches to understand, engage with, and address both gig worker issues and platform design challenges. This study aims to promote worker-centered design practices and enhance HCI and design methods to facilitate worker well-being and social justice.",

Yet, within the temporal unfolding of intimate relations comes discomfort, ambivalences, breakdowns, and disruptions. My dissertation research builds on this critical and feminist understanding of intimacy and relations to design long-term and plural modes of intimate care technologies. I present three previous research projects that use discomfort as a resource for intimate technologies. These include affective discomfort, menstrual discomfort, and unhabitual movements. Inspired by feminist crip technoscience and feminist theories on materiality of bodies, I inquire how we could design intimate technologies that enrich long-term and embodied relationship with our own menstruating bodies. In my upcoming studies, I plan to investigate the potential of close-to-body shape-changing touch as a modality for generating situated bodily knowledge and fostering proactive self-care for menstrual pain.",

      "abstract": "The continuous advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) enable designers to efficiently obtain vast amounts of inspirational materials during the design conception phase. Various modalities of stimuli can impact designers' creativity. However, the relationship between the sequence of different modalities (Text, Images, and Virtual Models) and creativity remains to be explored. In this study, we investigate the effects of 6 sequential combinations of 3 modalities on designers' creativity. Designers (N=36) used the creative stimulation platform InspireMe, accessing inspirational stimuli in various sequences to execute their design tasks. We analyzed the impact on creativity through assessments of work innovation and user interviews. The findings indicate that the sequence of material combinations significantly influences designers' creativity, with varying impacts on the different sub-attributes of creativity. Drawing on experimental findings and qualitative research, this paper introduces a creativity demand-matching inspirational stimulation interaction strategy—the CDI strategy—that assists designers in developing more targeted design solutions. Furthermore, we propose the 3C Framework, a design strategy for creativity stimulation platforms aimed at designers in the intelligent era. This framework aims to guide the development of creative stimulation platforms for designers in the intelligent era.",

While ABC can support efficient usage of resources, it faces criticism for diminishing Psychological Ownership (PO, what people feel a sense of ownership over but not necessarily legally own), which can impact users’ ability to achieve their goals using the goods. With little research in HCI and Interaction Design on integrating PO into the design of shared objects, this study uses a Research-through-Design (RtD) approach, using university hot desks as the context. First, we established seven design principles to increase PO in hot desks, based on interviews and previous studies. These design principles were then explored through the design and initial evaluation of ResponTable, a hot desk that adapts its surface to user preferences. These principles, alongside the desk design concept, serve as a provocation to inspire future research and design in promoting PO within ABC more broadly.",

However, there is little research on how stakeholders select a persona from a persona set. A think-aloud analysis with 37 stakeholders who were asked to select a persona for a content design task reveals that persona selection is influenced by comparative, non-comparative, and subjective elements. Persona choice is often made with task compatibility in mind: interests, professions, and education were important contextual factors in our focal task. Storifying is commonly applied by stakeholders, reflecting personas’ narrative nature. The persona’s picture is often evoked, in addition to nationality and name, though demographics do not play a decisive role. Stakeholders refer to a host of persona attributes when explicating their persona choice. Overall, reasonings for persona choice are multifaceted and individualistic, as we might expect given the information-richness of personas.\r\n",

This has led to the independent adoption of fitness tracking technologies for the management of long COVID. Through semi-structured interviews with 21 people with long COVID who used fitness tracking technologies, we found that fitness tracking devices were used to pace energy through finding correlations between activities and data, provide proof of illness to themselves, healthcare providers and friends and family, and to help gain a sense of agency and control during a new and enigmatic illness. Our findings support and extend design openings for the development of “pacing technologies”. These include the importance of customization and supporting the user in their recovery if appropriate, applying strategies for mitigating anxiety when tracking, facilitating the sharing of pacing data with friends and family and healthcare providers, and supporting users in identifying the optimal components of rest.",

These methods are impractical for designing robots that interact with diverse user groups in complex human environments. \r\nDrawing from the field of theater, we present the construct of scenes --individual environments consisting of specific people, objects, spatial arrangements, and social norms--  and tangible scenography, as a holistic design approach for human-robot interactions. \r\nWe created a design tool, Tangible Scenography Kit (TaSK), with physical props to aid in design brainstorming. We conducted design sessions with eight professional designers to generate exploratory designs. Designers used tangible scenography and TaSK components to create multiple scenes with specific interaction goals, characterize each scene's social environment, and design scene-specific robot behaviors. \r\nFrom these sessions, we found that this method can encourage designers to think beyond a robot's narrow capabilities and consider how they can facilitate complex social interactions.",

      "abstract": "Building new software tools for professional digital fabrication requires that HCI researchers understand domain-specific materials and fabrication workflows to ensure software operations align with professional manufacturing requirements. To bridge the research-practice divide, we adopt a practice-driven software development methodology for digital fabrication in an artist-in-residence program. In our method, HCI researchers and craft professionals collaboratively develop software tools over three months. We piloted our methodology through two consecutive computational ceramics residencies with five professional craftspeople. The teams produced five novel software tools for clay 3D printing and hundreds of ceramic artifacts. We provide a detailed description of our methodology through artist and HCI researcher accounts and an analysis of the integration of software ideation, implementation, and debugging with professional art and craft production. Our work demonstrates a systematic mechanism for achieving meaningful digital fabrication software contributions with mutual benefit for artists and researchers.",

We focus on zikr groups that offer online or hybrid participation. We conducted a qualitative study using interviews with practitioners and collaborative autoethnography as researchers/practitioners. Our findings surface themes of (i) shared spiritual energy, (ii) sensory experiences' role in spiritual energy, (iii) impact of technological mediation on sensory and spiritual experiences, and the (iv) importance of community. Our discussion contributes design considerations for techno-spirituality around (1) attunement, (2) practical audiovisual suggestions, and (3) `sensational forms'. Overall, we offer detailed experiential accounts of entanglements of sensory perception, spirituality, and attunement, and present generative design reflections suggesting avenues of further design research in supporting religious, faith-based, and/or spiritual practices in HCI.",

We take an aesthetic perspective, from which we consider the creation, consumption, and disposal of things under capitalism to be part of the same aesthetic pattern. Our aim is to explore the requirements of an alternative aesthetic of consumption, one that challenges designers to critically reflect on the implications of their designs, which is based on notions of care. We recount our initial thoughts and forays into giving shape to this aesthetic.",

      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, discussions of design patterns have turned from encouragement (what to do) toward discouragement (what to avoid). Termed dark, deceptive, or otherwise harmful, user experience (UX) patterns that serve to monetize engagement while reproducing and sedimenting structural inequities call for a shifting conversation around UX development and learning. This pictorial uses a visual case study of childcare worker platforms to help critically contextualize largely abstracted or universalizing UX patterns. Developing a form of critical documentation we call Care Layering, we show how approaching UX patterns as embodied and culturally-situated resources sheds light on both limitations and opportunities around gig work platform engagement. We end with a discussion of how Care Layering helps designers work towards greater accountability in UX design. ",

      "abstract": "Soft wearable robotics presents an opportunity to bridge robotics and textiles, offering lightweight, flexible, and ergonomic solutions for human-robot interaction, but previous studies on wearable soft robotics primarily focus on actuator performance without also considering wearability and interactivity. A rudimentary attachment method is usually adopted using external fixation devices such as straps to attach actuators to the user’s body, resulting in a poor wearing experience. This study focus on compatible and compact textile architectures to support actuators to be seamlessly integrated into daily wearing. It presents a research-through-design method to propose innovative knitting-integrated approaches for pneumatic actuator design to provide soft wearable robots with both aesthetic and functional values. Through a series of tests in which various knitting techniques and parameters are used to create sleeves that house silicone actuators, it explores design possibilities and understands the complex relationships between textiles and actuators. The findings contribute to advancing soft wearable robotics by offering practical solutions for integrating pneumatic actuators seamlessly into wearable textiles, thereby unlocking new possibilities for human-centered robotic systems.

      "abstract": "Data in Design and HCI research is often associated with something captured from the world in digital form and transferred to a database. However, the assumption of digitalisation, as well as the intentions and values underlying it, can obscure more nuanced approaches to data, and is becoming increasingly criticised (e.g., through notions of data colonialism, data extractivism, etc.). In this workshop, we invite participants to critically review data concepts and practices that sustain Western industrialised socio-economic systems, considering their ethical, environmental, and ecological implications. In contrast, we will explore data in the entangled ecologies of organisms, matter, and environments, focusing on 'livingness' as a way to reveal embodied, relational, and situated aspects of data. Through wandering and foraging, we will discuss how these aspects of data might help us regain our attentiveness, appreciation, and responsibility towards more-than-human ecologies, and ultimately reframe concepts of data in the world.",

Paralinguistics as a field of study is concerned with how you say something rather than what you say, and new AI-based statistical voice synthesis tools differ significantly from previous methods. As such, they require asking novel questions and provoking new thoughts. This paper contributes by analyzing and evaluating various voice cloning platforms by looking at how they describe their own ability to produce three different paralinguistic elements: laughter, stuttering and pacing. We focus on text-to-speech and hybrid approaches to voice cloning, and follow up our analyses by attempting to produce these three paralinguistic elements using the voice cloning platform ElevenLabs' voice synthesis tools. Conclusively, we draw on our results to pose questions for further investigation into what kinds of AI paralinguistic cultures can and should be designed.",

In this process, we involved a total of 104 participants across the different stages of our project. Initially, we collected qualitative data from remote audiences using several methods, including surveys, interviews, and observations. Through the thematic analysis of this data, we identified four design dimensions consisting of 17 key elements that illustrate what audiences value in remote music spaces. We applied these insights in a participatory design workshop with diverse stakeholders, contributing to the development of speculative design ideas in this field. The paper concludes by presenting key design insights for future technology advancements in remote music performances. This research contributes to the evolving design space of remote music performances, offering valuable perspectives for researchers, designers, and industry stakeholders.",

      "abstract": "Design Fixation refers to the tendency to adhere to pre-existing ideas, which hinders innovative design solutions. This research explores the potential of LLM-powered Creativity Support Tools, the 'Behaviorally Informed Creativity Support Tool (BI-CST),' to facilitate ideation and combat Design Fixation using 'Behavioral Science Theory.' BI-CST assists in redefining problems and generating new ideas by presenting experimental findings from Behavioral Sciences that challenge users' initial concepts, thus providing a deeper understanding of real human behaviors. We will assign three groups to different conditions: one designing without generative AI support, one with open-ended generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT), and one using a model trained in behavioral science. We aim to compare the originality, practicality, and general quality of the designs to assess design fixation. This study addresses design fixation through an interdisciplinary approach combining design and behavioral science, aiming to expand users' perspectives.",

      "abstract": "We present the design and evaluation of the Movits, a minimalist toolkit for embodied sketching design explorations. The toolkit includes technology probes featuring minimalist wearable digital units that support the hands-on exploration and design of movement-driven interactions using multisensory feedback. The Movits are self-contained and generate audiovisual or vibrotactile patterns in response to movement-based inputs. We present the theoretical and empirical grounding driving our design process. We discuss the findings of using the Movits during four co-design workshops with design students, technologists, dancers and physiotherapists, where they resulted in being generative and adaptable to a range of embodied design approaches. We contend that the Movits can be favourable for those interested in a holistic design approach to wearables in general and specifically for those targeting movement-based application domains.",

For this purpose, the interaction has become the primary site of empirical research. Yet, the relational, spatial and temporal boundaries that the interaction brings to bear are poorly defined, largely outdated and often restrictive. This results in novel findings aggregating to already worn-out narratives where the interaction is the only way algorithms participate and transform everyday life. In contrast, the concept of relationship, which entails relational, emotional, temporal, and spatial dynamics more attuned to how humans and algorithms increasingly influence each other, has received little attention. Borrowing Robert Hinde's framework of \"patterned interactions=relationship,\" this provocation challenges the limits of the interaction and argues that the relational boundaries of a relationship open up new opportunities for empirically researching how humans and algorithms influence each other over time.",

In this one-day workshop, we will invite the participants to bring pedagogical activities and materials from their own teaching for more-than-human perspectives in design (if they have prior experiences from teaching more-than-human perspectives, beginners are also welcome). Through structured and facilitated reflection, these pedagogical activities and materials will be analysed and mapped to build an overview of existing practices, explore similarities between them, and articulate challenges that come with teaching for more-than-human perspectives in design. The participants will be invited to continue sharing teaching practices after the workshop, to sustain the network and keep working towards a future curriculum for more-than-human in design.",

Recent advancements in generative AI and the proliferation of AI-generated content (AIGC) have intensified the problem with the ease that they can produce misinformation that is resilient to existing information assessment recommendations. Content labels have become a preeminent means to indicate the credibility of social media posts. Emerging adults (ages 18-25) are proportionally high social media consumers, yet prior work has shown that credibility indicators are less impactful on this age group. My dissertation aims to better understand how emerging adults evaluate sources of misinformation identification and labels in order to offer insights into how to design better credibility assessment tools.",

Responding to this, our focus is on design for longitudinally monitoring mobility, and in particular using wearable sensors that generate data on gait metrics to support clinical and self-care decision-making. We contribute to HCI research in three ways: (1) a detailed case study design process, including artifacts; (2) metaphorical framing concepts, with associated use cases illustrated through design scenarios; and (3) understanding of virtual-first practices in rehabilitation medicine that can be translated beyond MS care.",

To explore how this group imagines the future of technology, and how they see themselves within it, we conducted a series of speculative design workshops.  We asked participants to design a future communication technology and address its benefits, harms, and strategies for mitigating those harms, all through an Afrofuturist lens. Our findings show that when BWFNBP utilize Afrofuturism as a design and speculation framework, they bring their whole selves to the futures they envision. Their past and present experiences not only inform the features of their technologies but also influence how they imagine the technology impacting their communities. Beyond a conversation about what technology could be, the participants in this study take it one step further and examine what it should be.",

      "abstract": "Most people with a visual impairment retain some residual vision, yet accessibility strategies and research for visual art focus on non-visual aids and strategies. Little is known about how image enhancements may benefit people with low vision in art settings. Our study explored the challenges of people with visual impairments in museums and art galleries and the potential of visual enhancements to improve accessibility. Through online focus groups with 18 participants, we uncovered multifaceted visual challenges. Participants emphasised the role of non-visual senses to reduce visual ambiguities. Subsequently, we presented participants with the concept of image enhancements on Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) as a potential approach to enhance visual accessibility. Participants expressed nuanced perspectives, advocating for this technology to improve visual art. The findings provide valuable insights for designing HMDs to enhance the visual experience of people with low vision in museums and galleries.",

      "abstract": "Traditional games like \"Tag\" rely on shared control via inter-body interactions (IBIs) – touching, pushing, and pulling – that foster emotional and social connection. Digital games largely limit IBIs, with players using their bodies as input to control virtual avatars instead. Our “Shared Bodily Fusion” approach addresses this by fusing players' bodies through a mediating computer, creating a shared input and output system. We demonstrate this approach with \"Hidden Touch\", a game where a novel social electrical muscle stimulation system transforms touch (input) into muscle actuations (output), facilitating IBIs. Through a study (n=27), we identified three player experience themes. Informed by these findings and our design process, we mapped their trajectories across our three experiential spaces – threshold, tolerance, and precision – which collectively form our design framework. This framework facilitates the creation of future digital games where IBIs are intrinsic, ultimately promoting the many benefits of social play.",

This exploratory design research investigates how data drawings, created from personal, place-based observations of nature, can enhance human-nature connection and sensemaking in the Anthropocene. Can cooperative inquiry across different geographies, and the consequent confrontation of experiences, lead to a deeper awareness of larger, more-than-human systems? We introduce (1) a post-humanist design method called Dear Nature for supporting mindful reflection and sensemaking in human-nature relations, (2) our methodology and process based on data humanism, (3) analyses and outcomes from a five-week-long data collection and (4) considerations regarding how we can explore human-nature data reflections collectively to decenter the human in design. This first humble step towards non-anthropocentric design could lead to insights into post-humanist design thinking and the role of the human (and more-than-human) in designed systems.",

Leveraging and driven by the unique insights and experiences of PWS on VC, we conducted a two-phase co-design study with PWS to explore and reflect on the design space for inclusive and empowering VC technologies from their perspectives. Our findings present a broad design space for tools that support PWS before, during, and after VC, focusing on aspects such as supporting self-disclosure, educating non-stuttering audiences, and promoting personal reflection for long-term self-growth. While many design ideas by our participants embody universal value to all VC users, some carry an activism approach that proactively disrupts existing communication flows and norms to redistribute the power between stuttering and non-stuttering speakers in VC meetings. This work contributes to a thorough analysis of the design space and empowering PWS to be drivers and designers of inclusive VC experiences.",

Such design presents distinctive challenges and differs from designing for a physical space, as physical items may manifest in various forms in the virtual realm. Furthermore, designers may seek to incorporate unrealistic elements to optimize specific objectives, such as efficiency or comfort, considering the activities involved in the space. This research explores a framework for VR space renovation to offer a systematic guide to such designs. The framework examines physical and virtual spaces across various dimensions regarding space layouts and boundaries, activities and interactions, characters, and other dynamics. Furthermore, we implement a design example of renovating a Nordic studio apartment in VR and discuss insights that could inform and inspire future research. For instance, we illustrate how architecture and physical building components may convey different meanings in VR.",

As we move towards pluralistic ways of designing, different ethical sensibilities increasingly merge, diverge, and diffract. It becomes vital to attend to the implicit ethics that imbue design practice to envision alternative practices and generative epistemics for the interaction design discipline. My research develops felt ethics – an attitude of somatic, critical, and reflective attentiveness towards how our ethical sensibilities are engaged in design. I develop an understanding of ethical sensibilities as fundamentally relational and co-constitutional; shaped by factors such as our relationships with others, society, culture, politics, technologies, and materials. I discuss two ongoing project involving autonomous systems, using choreographic methods to explore ethical assumptions embedded in industrial robots and then reimagining such ethics using research through design. I conclude with open questions for the DIS 2024 Doctoral Consortium concerning the relation-making potential and resonance of felt ethics with other design practices.",

      "abstract": "Cultural Heritage is not just about tangible artifacts; it also includes intangible elements such as personal memories, community ties, and envisioned futures. Traditional museums and archives often emphasize physical items like architectural pieces and photos, while overlooking people's personal and emotional connections to cultural heritage. To illustrate the personal connections people have with cultural heritage sites, we designed an exhibition that displayed images created by participants, which represent their perspectives and future visions of cultural heritage sites. The exhibition's images, generated through GenAI, helped participants narratively describe cultural heritage locations, allowing them to express their visions of future threats like over-tourism and climate change on these sites. Contrary to constraints, co-creating with Generative AI associates participants with personal memories of cultural heritage, stimulating personal narratives and promoting deep reflection on cultural heritage preservation. The dissemination strategies we designed illustrate the use of GenAI to empower the expression of matters of cultural value beyond the physical.",

By presenting ORAgen in ‘think-aloud’ interviews with 17 professionals working in the creative and cultural industries, we explore potential values of media tokenisation in relation to existing challenges they face related to ownership, rights, and attribution. From our initial findings, we reflect specifically on the challenges of attribution and ongoing control of creative media, and examine how media tokenisation, and underpinning distributed ledger technologies can enable new approaches to designing attribution.

To comprehend the transformative impact of these technologies in fashion design, we conducted a systematic review covering 2013 to 2023, assessing the impact of VR/AR/MR adoption in fashion design. After screening 126 articles, we identified 26 articles that introduce immersive systems centered on two main themes: advancing the fashion design toolkit and enhancing fashion design processes. We discuss potential opportunities and limitations to be studied in future research and reflect on how VR/AR/MR technologies can continue to support fashion designers in fulfilling their needs and overcoming obstacles.

Inspired by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki's book In Praise of Shadows, we report on our journey towards building a sensibility and somaesthetic appreciation for shadows physically, metaphorically, and poetically. To investigate the idea of cultivating attentiveness to shadows, we embarked on a \"dérive\"-inspired adventure, gathering first-person perceptions and photographs of tables. We analysed these examples of tables and their shadows in order to inform the development of a project on interactive tables. Along with the artifact collection, we present a set of concepts, an initial prototype, and reflections on our own experience in developing this sensibility. We discuss shadows as a design material and an example of a design sensibility: a skill that can be sparked, fostered, and ultimately embedded.",

      "abstract": "Technology has become increasingly embedded throughout our lives and rapid technological innovation promises even more uses of future technologies. In fact, much of how technology is designed and sold to consumers centers around its usability. We relate to our interactive devices primarily as users, an extractive relationship that can foreclose more sustainable relations. This has in turn led to a paradigm of easily discarding our devices once they are no longer “useful” to us, collectively generating millions of tons of e-waste annually. I argue that providing end-users with alternative modes of engagement with their devices beyond “use” is essential for developing more sustainable futures of computing. What if our devices were designed not only for users, but also for recyclers, caretakers, or re-users - alternative roles that are oriented more towards sustainability? My research explores how designing and engineering devices for these alternative roles can empower users towards different relationships to their devices and even, to engage in more sustainable computing practices. I outline three projects that investigate these alternative roles through surveying current practices as well as engineering and evaluating assistive tools and artifacts. \r\n",

      "abstract": "Design empathy is a core HCI concept for understanding user perspectives in design processes. Although researchers advocate for leveraging design empathy in the design of assistive technology, educating novice designers about this is challenging; this is especially true in HCI classrooms when the target population includes people with disabilities, and students who do not have a disability are less aware of the diversity of disability. To help students better understand disability experiences, HCI education often adopts ``be-like'' (mimicking disabled-experience) approaches. However, accessibility researchers advocate adopting the ``be-with'' approach---learning about other's experiences through companionship. To mitigate the logistical challenges of being-with in a classroom setting, we developed a ``be-connected'' approach, which facilitates learning about the disability experience through the narratives of real individuals. Using social media posts from a spinal cord injury subreddit, we developed and deployed an activity aiming to develop design empathy. Our qualitative evaluation showed a notable transformation in students' design thinking process, suggesting an opportunity to leverage social media data to learn about disabled perspectives and develop design empathy.",

Drawing from activity and communication theory, we attempt to isolate the new value that large AI models can provide design compared to past technologies. We arrive at three affordances - dynamic grounding, constructive negotiation, and sustainable motivation - that summarize latent qualities of natural language-enabled foundation models that, if explicitly designed for, can support the process of design. Through design fiction, we then imagine a future interface as a diegetic prototype, the story of Squirrel Game, that demonstrates each of our three affordances in a realistic usage scenario. Our design process, terminology, and diagrams aim to contribute to future discussions about the relative affordances of AI technology with regard to collaborating with human designers.",

Its role is crucial in higher education to improve problem-solving, research, and teaching by acquiring, sharing, and applying knowledge. Higher education institutions can promote knowledge management through Communities of Practice, but doing so remains challenging due to cultural, organisational, and technological reasons. We present findings of the first step of co-design workshops with authentic higher education teaching teams that sought to understand (a) their practices as a community and any motivators and impediments to their community development; (b) how they perceived the tools they use for knowledge management; and (c) the kinds of tools they believed could help them better conduct knowledge management and develop as Communities of Practice. Our findings suggested four essential design requirements and informed our development of a new tool to support the knowledge management needs of higher education teaching teams.",

Existing efforts largely focused on privacy policy presentation and failed to systematically address a radical challenge of user motivation for initiating privacy awareness. Leveraging the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), we proposed design ideas and categories dedicated to motivating users to engage with privacy-related information. Using these design ideas, we created a conceptual prototype, enhancing the current App Store product page. Results from an online experiment and follow-up interviews showed that our design effectively motivated participants to attend to privacy issues, raising both the threat appraisal and coping appraisal, two main factors in PMT. Our work indicated that effective design should consider combining PMT components, calibrating information content, and integrating other design elements, such as visual cues and user familiarity. Overall, our study contributes valuable design considerations driven by the PMT to amplify the motivational aspect of privacy communication.\r\n",

While previous literature has addressed users’ perspectives on personalization, an important and underexplored research area is how personalization is approached within organizational contexts. This paper reports findings from qualitative interviews with designers, developers, and product managers at a multinational company that designs, builds, and commercializes PI tools for health management. The results point to four types of barriers participants consistently encountered, often leading personalization efforts to be scaled back, and three pragmatic approaches to personalization often adopted in the face of these barriers. The paper concludes with design implications for incorporating personalization while remaining aligned with the nuances, realities, and potential strain on systems and resources inherent to the design process in company settings.",

We describe a design exercise and follow-up elicitation study in which we identified on-hand gestures for cartographic interaction primitives. Microgestures and on-hand interactions are a promising space for AR map navigation as they offers always-available, tactile, and memorable spaces for interaction. Our findings show a clear set of microgesture interaction patterns that are well suited for supporting map navigation and manipulation. In particular, we highlight how the properties of various microgestures align with particular cartographic interaction tasks. We also describe our experience creating an exploratory proof-of-concept AR map prototype which helped us  identify new opportunities and practical challenges for microgesture control. Finally, we discuss how future AR map systems could benefit from on-hand and microgesture input schemes.",

      "abstract": "Creating software tutorials involves developing accurate code examples and explanatory text that engages and informs the reader. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a strong capacity to generate both text and code, but their potential to assist tutorial writing is unknown. By interviewing and observing seven experienced writers using OpenAI playground as an exploration environment, we uncover design opportunities for leveraging LLMs in software tutorial writing. Our findings reveal background research, resource creation, and maintaining quality standards as critical areas where LLMs could significantly assist writers. We observe how tutorial writers generated tutorial content while exploring LLMs' capabilities, formulating prompts, verifying LLM outputs, and reflecting on interaction goals and strategies. Our observation highlights that the unpredictability of LLM outputs and unintuitive interface design contributed to skepticism about LLM's utility. Informed by these results, we contribute recommendations for designing LLM-based tutorial writing tools to mitigate usability challenges and harness LLMs' full potential.",

The dimensions of social interplay surrounding every single table are profoundly complex. In our project, we lift the importance of the neglected space under the table through the playful development of a tangible prototype. We approached this by a design remake of the Mediated Body: a wearable prototype encouraging touch between strangers using the conductivity of the skin. Instead, we leverage the familiarity of tables as a means to encourage playful explorations of bare-skin touch. We report in visual and textual form on the emerging design knowledge throughout our design process, including first-person narratives by the designers. We contribute with (1) a series of counterfactual table artifacts inspired by the Mediated Body; (2) a sequence of participant studies analysed through reflexive thematic analysis and summarised into the notion of ``an odd invitation'' as a new lens for homo explorens; and (3) an appeal to the importance of design remakes for research-through-design.",

Trained user researchers need to analyze datasets and produce informative summaries pertaining to the original data. While Large Language Models (LLMs) could assist in generating summaries, they are known to hallucinate and produce biased responses. In this paper, we study human--AI workflows that differently delegate subtasks in user research between human experts and LLMs. Studying persona generation as our case, we found that LLMs are not good at capturing key characteristics of user data on their own. Better results are achieved when we leverage human skill in grouping user data by their key characteristics and exploit LLMs for summarizing pre-grouped data into personas. Personas generated via this collaborative approach can be more representative and empathy-evoking than ones generated by human experts or LLMs alone. We also found that LLMs could mimic generated personas and enable interaction with personas, thereby helping user researchers empathize with them. We conclude that LLMs, by facilitating the analysis of user data, may promote widespread application of qualitative methods in user research.",

      "abstract": "Manipulative and deceptive design practices are ubiquitous, impacting technology users in various ways across several domains. Certain groups are likely more susceptible to these impacts but have not received sufficient attention yet. In this paper, we seek to characterize one such understudied group, describing teenagers' experience of manipulative design. We conducted semi-structured interviews with six teenagers between 15 and 17 years old, to understand their daily interactions with manipulative designs in three contexts: social networks, video games, and e-commerce. Using reflexive thematic analysis, our findings describe how risk is a shared experience for teenagers, and interrogate how teenagers' personal and social context shape their experience of risk. We relate our findings to existing knowledge about how the general population is impacted by manipulative design practices and consider opportunities to further understand and support the experiences of teenagers and other vulnerable groups.",

Often, content creators are simply unaware of screen reader users’ experience and accessibility best practices; there is also a lack of research knowledge about how to design accessible image-dense media, like pictorials. We present (1) a content analysis of 149 pictorials, (2) a thematic analysis of three think-aloud sessions with an expert screen reader user, and (3) practical lessons learned from a co-design workshop with three blind scholars. Our research finds that pictorials are increasingly accessible, but they are still far from providing a usable experience. We identify nine “malicious” alt text patterns that riddle pictorials and three novel accessible alt text patterns to guide authors of image-dense media.",

Since sex/gender categories cannot convey nonbinarity and multiplicity, this project addresses the inherent tension between queerness and systematisation with an anticategorical quantitative visual approach, combining psychometric scales with visualisations of the gender spectrum. Indeed, using queer and feminist methodologies, we propose a new data structure resulting from the codesign of an interactive visualisation of the gender spectrum, made in an iterative dialogue with gender-diverse people. Our contribution is twofold: an inclusive data structure for the self-assessment of sex/gender identity, and an interactive visualisation, acting as a critical design object, educational and counselling tool, and basis for data collection, annotation, and analysis. Although aware that this project could both empower and harm sexual minorities, its originality is seeing nonbinarity and multiplicity not as appendices to a normative system, but as queering design principles",

This pictorial argues that educators are designers, and their curation of learning environments and experiences constitutes an underappreciated and complex design practice. Further, the design work that educators engage in is significant and consequential as it can define or reimagine who participates and what is valued in educational spaces – playing an important role in creating more equitable educational outcomes. In this pictorial, we leverage photos captured and curated by educators of their learning environments in library makerspaces and youth-serving technology centers to make their unseen design work and impact visible. Beyond making educators’ expertise more visible, this pictorial also offers design considerations for designers of technologies, materials, and experiences that may be situated in educational environments.\r\n",

We introduce VISMOCK, a data physicalization approach that leverages a fabric manipulation technique called “smocking”. VISMOCK supports the creation of interactive and dynamic data physicalizations by extending the smocking technique with programmable components such as thermochromic pigments and shape memory alloys. Using a research-through-design methodology, we develop an initial design space for VISMOCK that shows how data can be represented using visual and tactile variables, as well as the affordances of VISMOCK. We demonstrate the generative power of our design space through four exemplars, created using VISMOCK. We use these exemplars to discuss the advantages and limitations of VISMOCK as a tool for data physicalization. ",

      "abstract": "Emergent technology of digital phenotyping (DP) for mental health promises to serve as a window to the lived experiences of patients through the collection and analysis of passive and interaction data from personal mobile devices and wearables. However, the need for standardization, formalization, and interoperability requires DP algorithms to employ generalizable digital biomarkers that convert culturally and socially specific expressions of health, well-being, and illness into uniform, detectable, and quantifiable measurements. Authors critical of DP usually employ ethical and epistemological critique, which often either delegating responsibility or provide limited suggestions. Design and HCI are notably lacking from these conversations and practices. I argue that pragmatic aesthetics, which is focused on experience and perception, could be a generative bridge between philosophy and design for DP. Moreover, newly emerged aesthetics of care could be conducive to developing a more beneficial sensibility of what posthuman (i.e. algorithmic) care could support people with mental distress. These aesthetic theories are inherently intersubjective, thus requiring establishing new collaborative alliances between doctors, patients, and technologies, as well as cultivating new care practices and mind-body-technology relationships – the aspects that are currently lacking from both ethical and clinical research.",

      "abstract": "Despite significant advances in interactive clothing over the past decade, e-textiles lack traditional fabric robustness and comfort. SeamSleeve provides a method for using garment seams as sensing channels while retaining the benefits of regular clothing design. We power conductive seams at low voltages to stitch together everyday fabric panels, resulting in a novel sensing mechanism capable of detecting arm movements. Our first empirical study (n=10) identifies optimal seam design and placement on the sleeve, by comparing traditional seam forms in the context of sensing capabilities. A second study (n=14) demonstrates that our minimal sensing approach is capable of successfully classifying 8 arm exercises with an accuracy of 84%. Our findings support the effectiveness of the approach in areas such as longitudinal physiotherapeutic rehabilitation beyond the clinic, enabling everyday motion capture.",

Many lack the skills, experience, or knowledge to navigate legal proceedings without a lawyer, resulting in limited access to justice. Serious games may provide an effective, interactive, and engaging way of educating pro se litigants about the law and enabling their access to justice. Through participatory design with legal experts and an authoring tool, we co-designed RePresent, a serious game that helps individuals with limited access to legal support prepare for pro se litigation. A total of 965 people played RePresent and 149 provided feedback on their player experience. Results show that RePresent was engaging and valuable for learning about the law and pro se litigation. Our work highlights avenues for co-design methodologies with co-creative authoring tools that facilitate serious game design, contributing a potentially scalable solution to enable access to justice via co-authored serious games.",

It also offers learners a means of making personally meaningful, computational artifacts that support creative development, resonate with personal identities, and access a history of craft and culture. Yet, physical computing instruction remains a complex instructional practice that requires navigating computation and reasoning, engineering and mechanisms, and creativity and problem-solving between physical and virtual spaces. Spurred by the pandemic, the shift to remote instruction fostered a wave of creativity in physical computing instruction and new lines of inquiry around access and inclusion, resilient learning, and the creativity, craft, and culture found in physical computing. This one-day workshop will convene a network of researchers, educators, and designers to uncover, share and reflect on our creative instructional responses. We will develop a set of agendas for continued innovation and inquiry in creative physical computing education in post-secondary contexts. Our aim is to cross-pollinate research agendas and strengthen educational approaches in critical STEM and design practices.",

The study acts as an entry point for qualitatively exploring how nurses deal with and navigate bias in practice. What is critical data and documentation from nurses' perspective as part of caring for their patients and how do they consider bias? These questions are investigated ethnographically (67h of observations) in two Danish hospital wards that use a Data-driven Electronic Health Records (EHR) for nurses' documentation. Emerging data-driven EHRs work as platforms allowing for data extraction as well as easier access to merging data streams. A particular concern about data extraction is bias, which can enter EHRs through nurses' documentation. The study finds that nurses deal with bias as a matter of how they report data that are related to sensitive information about patients, such as culture or social status. This suggests a dilemma of importance for the design of EHRs when data work becomes policy.",

      "abstract": "Design is, and has long been, mononormative. It focuses on couples, dyads, and traditional relationship structures that are often taken for granted as the norm. In my dissertation, I contribute techniques for inquiring about lived experiences of queerness and queer relationships with data from sensorially rich first-person and participatory design perspectives. Using sonic and tactile media to probe about lived experiences of the important but under-studied relationship formation of polyamory, in my dissertation, I ask: how might we design with and within the contexts of polyamory and computing? The project uses a combination of autoethnographic design inquiry and participatory design to investigate personal data and its potential for exploring non-normative relationships and lived experiences of polyamory.\r\n\r\nMoving from individual to community-based design inquiries, my dissertation presents the development of autospeculation. I define autospeculation as a design research method that uses reflections on personal data to access and analyze lived experiences of technology design. I use autospeculation at both the individual and community registers. Using such practices, I argue for sensorially rich engagements with personal data as catalysts for personally meaningful reflection and speculation. Findings from my dissertation include: 1) autobiographical reflections with one’s own data can serve as a bridge between first-person research and participatory design research, 2) zines and craft-based design kits can successfully introduce participants to ways of engaging their data and of doing autospeculation, and 3) design researchers and practitioners can, as demonstrated by my dissertation, attend to more diverse relationship forms.",

I propose ontological breakdown as a lens for interrogating the default assumptions underlying the design of technology, using LLMs as a case-study and drawing parallels to the discourse on values in design. Then, I share three ways through which ontological breakdowns can be used generatively to (1) surface ontological difference and create spaces for experiencing ontological alternatives to our defaults , (2) explore ontological alternatives in the design of artifacts and enable the end-users to notice their own ontological defaults, and (3) expand ontological diversity by empowering the end-users to move beyond the prescribed defaults. I demonstrate the generative potential of ontological breakdowns by providing examples of my work in personal informatics.",

Despite a strong ethical commitment in these fields, challenges persist in grasping the complexity of researchers' engagement with ethics—practices conducted to operationalize ethics—in situated institutional contexts. Ethics Pathways, developed through six playtesting sessions, offers a design approach to understanding the complexities of researchers' past ethics engagements in their work. This activity involves four main tasks: recalling ethical incidents; describing stakeholders involved in the situation; recounting their actions or speculative alternatives; and reflection and emotional walk-through. The paper reflects on the role of design decisions and facilitation strategies in achieving these goals. The design activity contributes to the discourse on ethical HCI research by conceptualizing ethics engagement as a part of ongoing research processing, highlighting connections between individual affective experiences, social interactions across power differences, and institutional goals.",

      "abstract": "Anyone who has watched a child play with soft semi-liquid materials like honey, frosting, or slime, sees the fascinating interplay between design and physics. Many of us remember these experiences from our own childhood (or maybe not that long ago). These materials dribble and coil as they stack upon themselves when we drop them onto surfaces like cakes from small heights. This ludic behavior represents a physical phenomenon known as rope coiling. Recent research in 3D printing of clay and plastic has started to wonder how rope coiling can be leveraged to create new textures and textile-like structures through non-planar 3D Printing. These provide new tactile experiences in objects like cups and visual experiences in things like lamps. In this demonstrator, we invite researchers and practitioners to return to their childhood and dribble edible materials to understand how to advance additive manufacturing through interactive printing.\r\n",

The piece explores the use of various tools, platforms, technologies and processes as organisational reflective practices in digital design. Presenting itself initially as an innocuous desktop that the player slowly unfolds into a mystery, the game becomes a tour of multiple design reflection practices. Each desktop represents a different designer’s approach to capturing their own praxis, frequently through interactive demonstration of those forms of capture. By disguising these questions and analyses as something as prosaic as a series of navigable desktops, Reflective Surfaces asks the player to contemplate their own habits of knowledge formation and documentation.

Understanding the intricate relationship between humans and technology is at the core of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research and design. Amid the array of methodological tools available, first-person research methods have emerged as powerful instruments that enable researchers to delve deeply into the human-technology experience. Five years after the first edition of the Designing Interactive Systems (DIS) workshop on first-person methods, this full day workshop invites HCI researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts to embark on a journey of discovery of their sample of one. Drawing inspiration from the rich tradition of autoethnography, autobiographical design, embodied ideation, and more, we aim to explore the omnipresence of technology in our everyday lives while acknowledging our own subjectivity and positionality in research and design.",

In this study, we investigate Euro-Western artists’ expressed values for the design of Creative AI technologies. We conducted four workshops, in which artists engaged in value sketching and critical discussion around Creative AI, and analyzed emerging values. In the sketches, the artists predominantly expressed values of self-interest, while when encouraged for a critical discussion artists expressed values aligned with interest of others. We discuss the challenge of aligning Creative AI with design justice, when values of common good are not inherently part of the technological imaginaries, but rather need to be explicitly evoked. We open up these value tensions, discussing values’ actionability, and the implications for design futures of Creative AI. With this paper, we extend the empirical studies in value sketching and socio-technical landscape of Creative AI.",

      "abstract": "Choreography creation requires high proficiency in artistic and technical skills. Choreographers typically go through four stages to create a dance piece: preparation, studio, performance, and reflection. This process is often individualized, complicated, and challenging due to multiple constraints at each stage. To assist choreographers, most prior work has focused on designing digital tools to support the last three stages of the choreography process, with the preparation stage being the least explored. To address this research gap, we introduce an AI-based approach to assist the preparation stage by supporting ideation, creating choreographic prototypes, and documenting creative attempts and outcomes. We address the limitations of existing AI-based motion generation methods for ideation by allowing generated sequences to be edited and modified in an interactive web interface. This capability is motivated by insights from a formative study we conducted with seven choreographers. We evaluated our system's functionality, benefits, and limitations with six expert choreographers. Results highlight the usability of our system, with users reporting increased efficiency, expanded creative possibilities, and an enhanced iterative process. We also identified areas for improvement, such as the relationship between user intent and AI outcome, intuitive and flexible user interaction design, and integration with existing physical choreography prototyping workflows. By reflecting on the evaluation results, we present three insights that aim to inform the development of future AI systems that can empower choreographers. ",

      "abstract": "Message-based health information dissemination systems can potentially improve  maternal and child health (MCH). By conveying health information to parents, SMS- and chatbot-based systems can support parents’ learning and empower them to make better health decisions for their children. However, there is limited design advice for creating message-based dissemination systems for MCH. To help address this gap, we conducted 14 participatory workshops with 42 parents from Portugal and South Africa, exploring how parents learned to care for their children’s health. Our findings showed how parents reflected on the health advice they received, by assessing the fit of the advice to their child’s characteristics, their values and beliefs, the advice’s feasibility, or the intention and competence of the advice giver. Based on these insights, we propose four design implications for creating message-based health information dissemination systems tailored to parents and their children.",

In earlier works, tools that allow future wearers to express their needs and wishes are scarce. We took a Research through Design approach to create two tools for future wearers to capture their needs and wishes for fit in the context of workwear: a digital and an embodied tool. Five wearers of workwear have tried the two tools and selected their preferred one. Ultra-personalized lab coats were then produced for them. Participants were interviewed about their perceptions of the tools. We present opportunities and perceived risks associated with both tools, such as issues concerning the accuracy of measurement, profession-specific movements, and effort. The embodied tool was met with a high appreciation while the digital tool has more potential for scalability. This work suggests that qualities of both tools can be reconciled.",

However, how can we support care systems designers to apply these concepts in practice? This paper presents the Care Spectrums, a set of sensitising concepts for designers to explore and apply to their practice. Developed as a response to a design probe exercise (the CareTree) which was carried out with 14 participants over one month, the Care Spectrums respond to the multiplicity of expressions of care in participants’ everyday lives. Translated into a design resource (the ‘Co-Designing with Care’ card deck), and trialled with 10 designers, the Care Spectrums revealed hidden caring and uncaring practices in designers’ projects, and stimulated opportunities for designing with and for people’s complex and entangled care ecologies.",

While mobile technologies have freed users from having to be stationary during virtual meetings, mobile phones pose several usability challenges, such as reduced productivity, due to small screens and safety concerns. In this paper, we present the first exploration of augmented reality (AR) interface design for virtual meetings in real-world walking conditions. We conducted design sessions in-situ with 16 user interface and AR designers using a 2x2 experimental design: meeting while walking in two levels of traffic conditions and with two types of meeting formats. Results show that the designed AR windows averaged 14.5 times in viewing size compared to the most popular smartphone screens. Also, Traffic Level significantly affected the size, opacity, and placement of windows, as well as the preference of anchoring modes, while Meeting Format significantly affected size and opacity. Furthermore, clustering analysis identified two groups of designs that can serve as initial reference designs for further customization and research.",

As technologies and subsequent experiences rapidly become increasingly ubiquitous, it is essential to design pedagogy for these technologies at a human scale. The Pedagogies of Designing Blended Experiences workshop will discuss, present, ideate, and propose novel methods and techniques to develop pedagogies toward this need. The full-day workshop outcomes mainly revolve around a) Identifying key pedagogical problems and obstacles when designing across digital and physical spaces, b) Early ideation techniques for novel pedagogical approaches, and c) A three-phased speculative road-map to incorporate workshop outcomes in higher education learning.",

      "abstract": "Sensory technologies alter how we perceive our body, which can have profound implications for multiple domains. Prior work has contributed a myriad of artefacts and evaluative studies, but we still lack design knowledge to design meaningful body perception alterations facilitated by sensory technologies. To address this gap, we draw from soma design to propose a methodological approach centered on body sensations as design material. We articulate our approach based on a project on co-designing wearables to alter body perception together with professional dancers. Our approach involves engaging participants in articulating and sharing body sensations to others, and exploring somatically sensory stimuli to co-design concepts for future technologies. We contribute experiential facets of body sensations, movement and sensory potentials to alter sensations, methods and design strategies, and a collection of ideas. Our work can be relevant to design communities interested in sensory technologies, perceptual alterations and body sensations as material.",

Following a research-through-design approach, we developed a material recipe and weaving-based technique for speaker construction. Our goal was to understand how this blend of craft and technology could arouse curiosity and encourage playful making of technology. To this end, we conducted a hands-on workshop with ten experienced makers. From this workshop, several woven artifacts were generated and we discovered that integrating craft materials with electronic components fostered an acceptance of imperfection and sparked curiosity, encouraging participants to explore different ways of building electronics.",

NÆRVÆR symbolises a physical presence of the intangible affective experiences associated with grief as an ongoing connection to the deceased in the present. NÆRVÆR was developed in a Research through Design process fueled by both personal accounts and participatory engagements using various design probes exploring experiences of loss following the death of a loved one. In this pictorial, we unfold the theoretical, methodological, and material dimensions of this process to show how designers can accommodate grief in design practice as a way of utilising and materialising the affective forces present in such sensitive contexts.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges of promoting awareness among coworkers and teams for hybrid work, thereby promoting informal communication. Derived from the merits of onsite experiences, we intend to design human-like experiences to let information naturally flow into awareness. Through annotated portfolios and documented design space schemas, we filtered a design space comprising three aspects: social cues as information carriers, processing information with ambiguity, and ambient information delivery. All aspects are equipped with actionable options. To assess the effectiveness of our design space, we conducted structured workshops with design researchers. Through thematic analysis of workshop data, we informed our design space with one more aspect: built-in lightweight interactions. This design-space thinking process helped us gain an in-depth understanding of human-like experiences and insights into using our design space for ideation.",

However, we lack an understanding of how UX practitioners, UX teams, and companies actually utilize GenAI and what challenges they face. We conducted interviews with 24 UX practitioners from multiple companies and countries, with varying roles and seniority. Our findings include: 1) There is a significant lack of GenAI company policies, with companies informally advising caution or leaving the responsibility to individual employees; 2) UX teams lack team-wide GenAI practices. UX practitioners typically use GenAI individually, favoring writing-based tasks, but note limitations for design-focused activities, like wireframing and prototyping; 3) UX practitioners call for better training on GenAI to enhance their abilities to generate effective prompts and evaluate output quality. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for GenAI integration in the UX sector.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we discuss how interaction design experiments and interventions can play a role in sensitising humans to the more-than-human—specifically to plants and their significance to our lifeworld. Our work is rooted in two ideas (1) that deepening the understanding of human-plant relations is important for navigating the multiple planetary crises that we are currently facing, and (2) that interaction design allows for exploring the posthuman ontological model that rejects human exceptionalism and regards all entities as entangled and mutually constitutive. In discussing how design on several levels makes possible more-than-human reflections, the paper presents qualitative data gathered from interviews, diary entries, and observations from deploying two of our plant-electronics designs. Through identifying and organising surprises and recurring patterns in how people responded into three types of sensibilities (hermeneutic, existential, and socio-cultural), we discuss what happens when interaction design mediates entanglements between humans, plants, and other more-than-human actors.",

By conducting a comprehensive analysis of the responses from the official map creator and accessibility problems reported by 35 crowd workers, we provided the following four suggestions: S1, it is desirable to avoid omitting the creation of official maps; S2, various stakeholders should report accessibility problems as crowd workers; S3, problems along the routes leading to building entrances should be supplemented through crowdsourcing; and S4, dynamically changing accessibility problems should be captured through crowdsourcing. These suggestions contribute to the improvement of both official and crowdsourced accessibility mapping.",

We argue that designers and researchers should focus on civic participation in design after design as an opportunity to increase democracy. We base our results on learnings from an engagement with a volunteer-based IT helpdesk at a public library in Denmark and three employees from the Danish Agency for Digital Government. In this paper we focus on a specific period of the engagement which consists of three workshops and backstage design activities.",

In digital games, it is unclear how players experience game-unrelated thoughts (GUTs), whether GUTs should be encouraged by game designers, or how it may impact player experience. We ran an initial study to confirm whether GUTs are common (50 of 100 participants reported experiencing them). We then collected 840 minutes of gameplay data from 12 participants playing games they: (1) found relaxing, (2) lost track of time in, and (3) spent most hours playing. Eye-tracking data and experience sampling were used to contextualize a phenomenological analysis of gameplay data. We identified four themes encompassing gameplay, GUTs, and gaze behaviour: these provide a foundation for future research and game design incorporating GUTs.",

Facing, confronting, and noticing such thoughts without support can be challenging. To provide a playful setting and leverage the technical maturation of VR, our VR experience, Mind Mansion, places the user in an initially cluttered virtual apartment. Here we utilize established concepts from traditional therapy and metaphors identified in prior works to let users engage metaphorically with representations of thoughts, gradually sorting the space, fostering awareness of thoughts, and supporting mental self-care. The results of our user study (n = 30) reveal that Mind Mansion encourages the exploration of alternative perspectives, fosters acceptance, and potentially offers new coping mechanisms. Our findings suggest that this VR intervention can reduce negative affect and improve overall emotional awareness.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, body dissatisfaction interventions have been designed with a focus on females from Western cultures. However, with growing research indicating that body dissatisfaction is experienced across society, regardless of gender and cultural background, it is increasingly important that future interventions incorporate a broader range of socio-cultural experiences. We conducted a two-phase co-design study with thirteen participants (seven females, six males), aged 18-24, from diverse cultural backgrounds. Phase 1 aimed to understand the influencing factors that frame the development of body image perceptions. Drawing on insights from Phase 1, Phase 2, then explicitly focused on gathering design insights for digital tools for body dissatisfaction interventions. Four narrative design concepts were used to provoke discussions and ideate around potential digital interventions. Through this paper, we contribute unique insights into the experiences and digital intervention preferences of underrepresented people in body image research and highlight future directions to create more inclusive digital interventions.",

This demo describes an interactive table prototype using bare-skin touch between two users to control a soundscape supported by light. It builds on previous work in playful interactions and delivers an ambiguous connection between the modes of interaction and actuation. The prototype invites users to collaboratively interpret and experiment in order to make meaning of their touch, exploring each other's skin. We conducted a preliminary study with 13 couples and report on their impressions. This abstract outlines the design process of the interactive musical table prototype, highlighting its potential to inspire creativity and spark curiosity in a design audience.",

      "abstract": "Visually oriented designers often struggle to create effective generative AI (GenAI) prompts. A preliminary study identified specific issues in composing and fine-tuning prompts, as well as needs in accurately translating intentions into rich input. We developed DesignPrompt, a moodboard tool that lets designers combine multiple modalities — images, color, text — into a single GenAI prompt and tweak the results. We ran a comparative structured observation study with 12 professional designers to better understand their intent expression, expectation alignment and transparency perception using DesignPrompt and text input GenAI. We found that multimodal prompt input encouraged designers to explore and express themselves more effectively. Designer’s interaction preferences change according to their overall sense of control over the GenAI and whether they are seeking inspiration or a specific image. Designers developed innovative uses of DesignPrompt, including developing elaborate multimodal prompts and creating a multimodal prompt pattern to maximize novelty while ensuring consistency.",

      "abstract": "Everyday objects, like remote controls or electric toothbrushes, are crafted with hand-accessible interfaces. Expanding on this design principle, extended reality (XR) interfaces for physical tasks could facilitate interaction without necessitating the release of grasped tools, ensuring seamless workflow integration. While established data, such as hand anthropometric measurements, guide the design of handheld objects, XR currently lacks comparable data, regarding reachability, for single-hand interfaces while grasping objects. To address this, we identify critical design factors and a design space representing grasp-proximate interfaces and introduce a simulation tool for generating reachability and displacement cost data for designing these interfaces. Additionally, using the simulation tool, we generate a dataset based on grasp taxonomy and common household objects. Finally, we share insights from a design workshop that emphasizes the significance of reachability and motion cost data, empowering XR creators to develop bespoke interfaces tailored specifically to grasping hands.",

However, there are also concerns about accuracy and trustworthiness of self-care advice provided via AI. This paper reports our findings from workshops, diaries, and interviews with five researchers and 24 participants to explore their experiences and use of generative AI for self-care. We analyze our findings to present a framework for the use of generative AI to support five types of self-care, – advice seeking, mentorship, resource creation, social simulation, and therapeutic self-expression – mapped across two dimensions – expertise and modality. We discuss how these practices shift the role of technologies for self-care from merely offering information to offering personalized advice and supporting creativity for reflection, and we offer suggestions for using the framework to investigate new self-care designs.",

      "abstract": "The population of older adults experiencing cognitive decline is growing faster than the number of workers who can care for them. Artificially intelligent (AI) agents could assist these older adults, keeping them in their homes longer. For this to happen, older adults must be willing to adopt and rely on agents. Would they trust an agent that might need to report their decline to others? We conducted a speed dating study exploring the impact of agent affiliation (i.e., who the agent should work for). Our healthy and declining participants reacted positively to the idea of agents supporting them. They particularly recognized how the agent would reduce the burden placed on their family caregivers. They viewed affiliation to be dynamic, shifting from the declining older adult and orienting more to their caregivers over the course of cognitive decline. They envisioned the agent modifying its decision-making process to be like their caregivers'.",

      "abstract": "Environmental sustainability is increasingly important, and actions on “digital sustainability” are expanding to reduce energy consumption from digital infrastructures. As many digital services today have extensive user bases, exploring sustainable design features holds significant potential for reducing environmental impact. However, further exploration of foundational research is still necessary to enable broader and more effective adoption of digital sustainability in design practice. This study focuses on understanding important considerations when encouraging more designers, especially those with limited expertise in sustainability-oriented design, to integrate sustainable practices into digital services—acknowledging that embracing unfamiliar approaches presents natural challenges. We conducted design workshops and debriefing interviews with user experience (UX) designers unfamiliar with design for sustainability to explore their early encounters with sustainable interaction design (SID) in the context of digital infrastructure energy reduction. Our study provides insight into designers’ initial perceptions and challenges with sustainable design and discusses opportunities for their broader engagement.",

Even in the context of sex education, sex is often viewed primarily through the lens of reproduction or the prevention of infections. While we deem such approaches valuable, we argue that we also need media exploring other aspects of sex, such as playfulness, pleasure, self-discovery, and communication. In this paper, we present our ongoing project Pussy Palette, a digital toy encouraging people with vulvas to communicate their sexual desires. Using only speech input, players communicate with the computer and explore how it reacts. User tests so far have revealed design challenges, but also promising affordances of our toy.",

Despite their widespread use in a short amount of time, embedding these models into interactive artifacts is still largely unexplored. In this pictorial, we unpack the design and development process of GenFrame, an image generating picture frame that utilizes generative AI capabilities to mimic traditional paintings. Our work details the necessary steps to integrate generative AI into interactive artifacts and highlights important design considerations for controlling image-generation models in order to achieve specific design intents. Our insights provide interaction designers with a more comprehensive understanding and approach towards utilizing image-generation AI models for interactive artifacts. \r\nA demo can be viewed at https://youtu.be/1rhW4fazaBY",

However, these explorations often remain largely theoretical or small-scale and local. We advocate for more diverse experimentation to foster pluralistic viewpoints in design processes. Our one-day workshop aims to develop methods for pluriversal art and design practice, emphasizing intuitive and systematic perspective-building in social contexts. We strive to explore, share and map emerging design methods to think through multiple perspectives. We will invite designers who embrace heightened sensitivity towards entities beyond the human realm and support relational approaches in design. This workshop will explore how design interventions, visual mapping, and other-than-human HCI can become 'enabling methods' that contribute to understanding others' perspectives and relations. Through experience with a case of temporalities in human-plant interaction, we will discuss how these methods can contribute to broader goals of developing relationality and endorsing eco-centric approaches in design practice.

      "abstract": "This research investigates the potential of emerging communication strategies to enhance engagement with climate change data through HCI, by recognizing the critical challenge of effectively communicating complex hyperobejcts. We designed \"Finding Arcadia\", an interactive artefact centred on ocean climate data, to explore how data humanism, storytelling, decentering the human in the narrative, and positive framing influence user engagement and perception of the information. Findings from a study in-the-wild (N=42) and a post-experience survey conducted six months later (N=19) foregrounds strategies to foster deeper engagement and connection with the information but also tensions in engaging with such a complex topic. We contribute to climate change communication and HCI research with the design decisions, study outcomes, and reflections on ways in which communication strategies can promote understanding and connection with a hyperobject.",

      "abstract": "HCI research has demonstrated that textiles have interactive potential, with the ability to transform or self-shape, whether through material, structure, or the addition of non textile elements. Many materials for developing interactive or animated textiles – textiles which change during use – are fossil fuel-based, require electricity for activation, or are only available in small quantities. In this pictorial we present our exploration of high-twist linen yarn as an actuator material in woven textiles. Through experimental design research, we have defined key parameters affecting use of the material, and identified combinations of material and structure producing contrasting textile movement. The resulting woven textiles may be activated by spraying with water, or in high humidity, and the actuation is repeatable after drying, offering multiple modes of interaction. We offer proposals for HCI applications for the animated linen yarn, alongside a guide to facilitate producing and designing animated woven linen textiles.",

Capra is a system we designed that brings together the capture, storage, and exploration of personal hiking data with an emphasis on longer-term use. In this pictorial, we unpack our process of making a short film that aims to communicate the workings and experience of Capra to a broader audience. We encountered frictions in mobilizing key theoretical concepts framing Capra as a Research through Design (RtD) artifact in the making of our film. We reflect on tactics for working through such frictions, how they can support future work, and how the filmmaking process can offer a valuable approach for distributing RtD artifacts to broader audiences.

We used queer methods to design puzzles with archival materials, guiding participants from a more normative “surface” understanding of history into exploring queer histories, breaking familiar language and constructs through play and tangible interaction. Our reflections contribute design considerations for queering tangible interaction through puzzles: (1) designing and deconstructing layers of queer understanding, (2) attending to situatedness in designing tangible puzzle artifacts, and (3) designing puzzles that solve to complexity. We also offer insights on how facilitation and debrief of the experience can prompt reflection on queer history and ways of understanding. Overall, this pictorial contributes to Queer HCI by deepening queer tangible interaction, particularly for exploring queer history.",

This pictorial contributes to these efforts by shedding light on a kind of managerial work that emerged when creating a complex e-textile installation. Specifically, we reflect on our project through the lens of “design bookkeeping” to describe documents that embody managerial knowledge and describe what these documents make intelligible about our practice. We surface findings and cross-cutting themes that bring attention to these practices in relation to broader understandings of project documentation. We then speculate on how the DIS community could circulate this knowledge within, and beyond, academic publication venues.",

In hackeanos participants are invited to appropriate technologies in order to decode and reconfigure their relationship with the Ocean―understood as a single interconnected planetary entity. In the context of HCI-driven hackathon research, this novel conceptualization retrieves the notion of issue-oriented hackathons while tackling the gap in sustainable hackathon outcomes through the joint promotion of Ocean and Digital Literacy. As such, hackeanos are set to become a “Twin Education model” backing the EU's vision for a Blue Economy-driven Twin Transition. By tapping into design, artistic/speculative thinking, social sciences and environmental studies, our proposal aims to exemplify Entanglement HCI’s potential in addressing the SDGs and akin future-setting frameworks (e.g. the IOC-UNESCO Ocean Decade or EU New European Bauhaus).",

      "abstract": "In high-stakes areas such as law enforcement, where artificial intelligence has the potential to enhance effectiveness and inclusivity, its decisions must be both informed and accountable. Thus, designing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for such settings is a key social concern. Yet, explanations in practice are often overly technical or abstract. To address this, our study engaged with police employees in an EU country, who are users of a text classifier. We found that for them, usability and usefulness are paramount in explanation design, whereas interpretability and understandability are less emphasized. Drawing from these insights, we suggest design guidelines centred on clarity and relevance for domain experts. We contribute recommendations which guide XAI system designers to better cater to the specific needs of specialized users and promote the responsible use of AI tools in public service.",

      "abstract": "Robots and other autonomous agents are well-positioned in the research discourse to support the care of people with challenges such as physical and/or cognitive disabilities. However, designing these robots can be complex as it involves considering a wide range of factors (e.g., individual needs, physical environment, technology capabilities, digital literacy), stakeholders (e.g., care recipients, formal and informal caregivers, technology developers), and contexts (e.g., hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient care facilities, private homes). The challenges are in gaining design insights for this unique use case and translating this knowledge into actionable, generalizable guidelines for other designers. This one-day workshop seeks to bring together researchers with diverse expertise and experience across academia, healthcare, and industry, spanning perspectives from multiple disciplines, including design, robotics, and human-computer interaction, with the primary goal being a consensus on best practices for generating and operationalizing design knowledge for robotic systems for care settings.

We aim to harness the expressive power of creative robotics alongside theatrical elements to enhance storytelling, foster interdisciplinary collaborations, and innovate pedagogy. Through participatory design and engagement with posthuman philosophies and new materialisms, we will delve into the nuances of embodied intelligence—movement, gaze, gesture, and more—within the performative realm. This workshop combines theatre and performance techniques with participatory methodologies to cultivate a creative dialogue between participants, technology, and performance. Our objective is to develop hybrid design toolkits and co-design methodologies that address the nuanced relationship between humans, technology, and society, particularly focusing on vulnerability, failure, and disobedience as catalysts for innovation in creative robotic theatre. The outcomes will contribute to defining creative robotic theatre's scope, influencing both academic discourse and practical applications in wellbeing, care, and beyond.",

Yet despite the creative potential to disrupt how the built environment is represented, the metaverse tends to simulate the architectural conventions of physical reality. By visiting the virtual reality sites of 30 interiors, buildings, and plazas within popular metaverse platforms, we identified outliers in convention to curate a `Metaverse Design Catalogue' of architectural features that were uncommon or unrealistic in physical reality. We thus challenged 21 architectural experts to use the catalogue as a catalyst to design an architecture that goes beyond convention to become `superarchitectural'. Based on their redesigned and reimagined floor plans and perspective drawings, we inform the design language of a superarchitectural metaverse through the dimensions of architectural diegesis, mutability, and asymmetry.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores how a gesture-based robot influences human-human interaction in group ideation. The robot was mounted on a whiteboard and responded with six different gestures (e.g., nodding, following speakers with gaze) to specific situations. We coded the participants’ interactions from videos and gathered their experience through post-session interviews. The most frequently invoked robot behavior was following the speaker with gaze. As a result, participants felt socio-emotionally supported and responded by moving the ideation ahead (individual level) and consensus-building (group level). In fact, the groups with the robot showed more consensus-building than the two reference groups without the robot. Participants had different views on the role of the robot in the group, such as active outsider, supportive group member, or assistant. The latter tried to use the robot as decision-support. All in all, to include a robot to mediate human groups seems a promising future application domain.",

      "abstract": "Data donation is an emerging practice enabling personal data collection for research. While it offers opportunities to access new insights into people's behavior and experiences through their digital-trace data, the role of individuals -- as research participants -- is limited in most data donation projects. They primarily contribute with data, limiting the perspectives included and accounted for around critical research-design decisions. In this paper, we explore the opportunity to embed data donation in research processes that are not only contributory but collaborative and co-created. To do so, we present a participatory data donation case study focused on athletes’ perceptions of the impact of their menstrual cycle on their sports performance through their physical activity data. Based on the data donation experiences of 20 athletes, our paper provides insights into people’s preferences and expectations in participatory data donation processes and discusses considerations for supporting various degrees of participation in future data donation research.",

      "abstract": "Care work is always already unequal. It involves looking after others’ physical, psychological, emotional, and developmental needs. Paid care work tends to be conducted in private spaces, lack regulation, and reproduce unequal dynamics between clients and workers. These conditions lead to porous boundaries, a permeability experienced by workers between care and work, professional and personal, and private and public (sectors and spheres). Drawing on interviews with 16 workers who find work using Care.com, we argue that the porous boundaries of care work are reified in new ways through the design and use of emerging digitally mediated matching platforms. This has particular impacts for ranking personhood, reducing worker safety, and increasing atomization. In contrast, we find benefits in the forum-like structure and visible, interactive conversations of other platforms used to access childcare work. We end with a discussion of porousness by design and the trouble of locating design within worker platforms.",

Traditional ethics in HCI often overlook interpersonal considerations, resulting in static frameworks ill-equipped to address dynamic social contexts and power dynamics. Drawing from feminist perspectives, the workshop aims to lay the groundwork for developing a meta-toolkit for community-led feminist ethics, fostering collaborative research practices grounded in feminist ethical principles. Through pre-workshop activities, interactive sessions, and post-workshop discussions, participants will engage in dialogue to advance community-led ethical research practices. Additionally, the workshop seeks to strengthen the interdisciplinary community of researchers and practitioners interested in ethics, digital civics, and feminist HCI. By fostering a reflexive approach to ethics, the workshop contributes to the discourse on design's role in shaping future interactions between individuals, communities, and technology.",

      "abstract": "With the progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and rapid development of wearable smart devices like smart glasses, there is a growing opportunity for users to interact with on-device virtual assistants through voice and gestures with ease. Although voice user interfaces (VUIs) have been widely studied, the potential uses of full-body gestures in VUIs that can fully understand users' surroundings and gestures are relatively unexplored.\r\nIn this two-phase research using a Wizard-of-Oz approach, we aim to investigate the role of gestures in VUI interactions and explore their design space. In an initial exploratory user study with six participants, we identify influential factors for VUI gestures and establish an initial design space. In the second phase, we conducted a user study with 12 participants to validate and refine our initial findings. Our results showed that users are open and ready to adopt and utilize gestures to interact with multi-modal VUIs, especially in scenarios with poor voice capture quality. The study also highlighted three key categories of gesture functions for enhancing multi-modal VUI interactions: context reference, alternative input, and flow control.Finally, we present a design space for multi-modal VUI gestures along with demonstrations to enlighten future design for coupling multi-modal VUIs with gestures.

We investigate one such tool, the calculator, which helps with arithmetic, but also commonly offers specialized functions for conversions, formulas, or graphing. Through an analysis of calculator apps and use cases, we describe limitations of current calculators. Crucially, calculator apps remain detached from tasks, motivating us to explore how to more closely integrate calculation with the world through augmented reality (AR). AR calculators can directly use measurements and numbers from the world in calculations as well as display results of calculations in the world. We provide a conceptual account of calculation in AR, as well as video prototypes that concretize the concept across different scenarios. These examples demonstrate how moving tools like the calculator to AR offers tighter task integration and reduces the work required in translating between the world and computational tools.",

      "abstract": "Proponents of digital fabrication argue that future technologies will fundamentally reshape manufacturing; however, we still have a limited understanding of the relationship between contemporary digital fabrication technologies and the values and labor of people who make things. Contemporary materialist theories can offer insights into how interaction modalities with machines and materials influence human production activities. We aim to implement these theoretical principles in technical system development. We focus on action as a bridging concept between abstract notions regarding human-machine-material relationships and concrete digital fabrication system features. We use CNC-milled surface texture production on wood as a case study. We follow a research-through-design process to develop Millipath, an action-oriented programming platform enabling the parametric design of machine toolpaths. Through the analysis of autobiographical data from fabricating artifacts, we investigate how digital fabrication systems informed by materialist theories support expressive modes of production and design decisions in response to material behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Prototyping AI applications is notoriously difficult. While large language model (LLM) prompting has dramatically lowered the barriers to AI prototyping, designers are still prototyping AI functionality and UI separately. We investigate how coupling prompt and UI design affects designers' workflows. Grounding this research, we developed PromptInfuser, a Figma plugin that enables users to create semi-functional mockups, by connecting UI elements to the inputs and outputs of prompts. In a study with 14 designers, we compare PromptInfuser to designers’ current AI-prototyping workflow. PromptInfuser was perceived to be significantly more useful for communicating product ideas, more capable of producing prototypes that realistically represent the envisioned artifact, more efficient for prototyping, and more helpful for anticipating UI issues and technical constraints. PromptInfuser encouraged iteration over prompt and UI together, which helped designers identify UI and prompt incompatibilities and reflect upon their total solution. Together, these findings inform future systems for prototyping AI applications.",

      "abstract": "HCI and design studies have increasingly identified challenges for gig workers and advocated for designs centered around worker justice. However, there's an existing research gap in understanding how platform designers approach gig worker issues in their practice. Our study engaged ten platform designers from food delivery and ride-hailing platforms to investigate this gap. Through semi-structured interviews, we uncovered their strategies, the extent of authority and responsibilities, and the range of obstacles they encounter in influencing decision-making that could affect gig workers’ experiences with the platforms. While platform designers were aware of gig worker issues, they confronted challenges from business goals, decision-making power, policies, and job security in promoting worker well-being. We discuss the jurisdiction of platform designers and propose that HCI research should further support them, who are deeply engaged in the gig economy and have the potential to participate in addressing social justice issues.",

Professional designers frequently bypass CAD and instead design at the level of the machine toolpath. This CAM-based design process allows for material exploration, unique textures, and complex shapes. We recognize young people’s role as designers and seek to adapt professional digital fabrication techniques to meaningful youth design activities. We present a youth-oriented CAM-based design curriculum consisting of 1) hands-on activities that introduce machine toolpath concepts, 2) a learner-oriented CAM software interface that scaffolds digital toolpath creation, and 3) project-oriented design activities that integrate CAM-based design and manual craft for ceramics and textile production.  We evaluated our approach through a workshop with twelve high school students. Our research shows that young people can skillfully apply CAM-based design and manual craft to create functional and personally meaningful artifacts.",

It involves the development of conceptual artefacts, including the 'Data Donation Card', which employs the methodologies of critical design but challenges conventions of the field by suggesting more mundane speculations removed from reliance on diegetic elements. The purpose is to confront the perceived elitism of 'designed' critical artefacts that rely on aesthetics and the ambiguous provocation of thought in the viewer. The Data Donation Card takes the form of a public information campaign, including a website, social media accounts, and a physical/digital card. This paper identifies six provocations based on the development of the artefacts. By removing preconceived notions of fiction and speculation, which can induce cynicism, it aims instead to explore tensions and anxieties by raising awareness about data after life in a non-didactic manner to contribute to understanding the complexities inherent in posthumous data donation",

In this provocation, we offer three explorations where we physicalize personal data: handwritten notes, photos of everyday artifacts, and menstrual cycle data. In each data collection and representation set, we focus on the inevitable presence of ‘the backstory’: the context and setting in which data are collected and materialized.

In this context, we ask: is the evolving hackathon format retaining its distinctiveness and relevance? This paper explores these questions through a dual contrast: the latest insights into hackathon research versus a more radical, “cyborgly” perspective on hack[ing mar]athons, and the “social” versus “political” nature of issue-oriented hackathons. As a result, we re-envision hackathons as stagings of both our inner contradictions and collective disagreements. The inherent entangled fabric of hackathons warrants them attention as intuitively more-than-human co-creation formats and sociotechnical phenomena uniquely positioned at the intersection of technology, society, and politics.",

But few questions have been asked about what motivates the design process and how deck designers see their role in inquiry and/or world building. This paper looks to the Tarot deck as one iconic example of such a process. Drawing on interviews with nine Tarot deck creators, we surface themes of Tarot as scaffolding modes of personal and collective growth, forms of carework, and pathways for different ways of knowing. We discuss expanding design inquiry methods for understanding and elevating forms of spiritual connection and care; and moving from anti-appropriation to ante-appropriation.",

      "abstract": "The speculation of alternative relationships between humans and nonhumans is a crucial element of examining our dominating stance towards nature amidst the ongoing environmental crisis. The notion of designing for interdependence challenges this status quo, focusing on a local ecosystem and embedding carefully crafted artefacts to foster more-than-human relationships. The presented work engages with the intricate interdependence of bees, artefacts, time and location through an ongoing case study of designing with and living with red mason bees (Osmia bicornis). Unpacking the first author’s design journey, we elucidate how attentive observations of the garden and engagement in activities such as the making of a beehouse have mobilized caring for the local ecosystem. With our focus on relationships emerging from situating oneself in a location for multispecies cohabitation, our research describes the dynamics of sharing resources between humans and nonhumans and its potential as a repertoire of more-than-human design.",

However, this model can compromise the patient-centeredness of care and the level of clinician involvement. There is scope to develop alternative interaction models, but we need methods for exploring and comparing these to assess how they may impact clinical decision-making. Through collaborating with clinical, AI safety, and HCI experts, and patient representatives, we co-designed a number of alternative human-AI interaction models for clinical decision-making. We then translated these models into ‘Wizard of Oz’ prototypes, where we created clinical scenarios and designed user interfaces with different types of AI output. In this paper, we present alternative models of human-AI interaction and illustrate how we used a co-design approach to translate them into functional prototypes that can be tested with users to explore potential impacts on clinical decision-making.

      "abstract": "Metaverse platforms have been on the rise in recent years, offering three-dimensional (3D), immersive virtual worlds while encouraging user-generated content (UGC) in various forms. Roblox, a popular metaverse platform, enables its users to create a holistic virtual world (i.e., develop a 3D game) for other users to interact with. However, complex UGC is also challenging to moderate. Roblox has been notorious for its users’ harmful designs, such as Nazi or terrorist role-playing mechanisms. In this study, we explore how harmful design takes place on Roblox. Through a grounded theory analysis of the ‘r/Robloxgamedev’ subreddit, we conceptualize an ecological view of harmful design, foregrounding three interconnected circumstances, namely sociotechnical risks, socioeconomic precarities, and normative (in)sensitivities, which work together to condition and give rise to harmful designs and bring about unique governance challenges to metaverse platforms. We conclude by laying out implications for design moderation.",

Over distance, these passive aspects are hard to experience as most communication technologies support sharing conversations or activities. Through a research-through-design methodology, we explored the design of smart home technologies for passive co-presence over distance. Based on our design explorations, we arrived at an interaction space which includes the dimensions of Activity, Solitude, Synchronicity, and Spontaneity. Our research-through-design process additionally resulted in the design of two smart home systems. The There Chair employs the senses of touch and sight to passively display when a remote family member is sitting at the dining room table. The Fragrance Frame is a paired picture frame that detects when a remote family member is passing by their frame, and emits a scent reminiscent of togetherness. We reflect on our design decisions and propose considerations for future design.",

However, video content moderators are exposed to more profound emotional labor because videos contain rich visual information, sometimes including even harmful content, such as violent or terrifying scenes. In this work, we explore the effect of six intervention techniques on alleviating negative emotions during video content moderation tasks. We conducted one online crowdsourcing experiment and two controlled user studies to find out that (a) interleaving with positive videos or (b) cartoonization could significantly reduce negative emotions in the moderators. Participants reported that the advantages of these approaches are in helping reduce negative emotions at the time of moderation while existing approaches focus on post-task activities (e.g., relaxation or getting a hobby). We discuss the applicability of our findings to broader tasks, including improvement in intervention techniques. ",

However, there is little research into pre-adolescent children’s pain logging tools. Utilising the Bluebells method to engage children as co-designers, we gathered children’s perspectives on pain-logging tools; in the first workshop by using tangible design approaches to support creative thinking, and in the second workshop by discussing developed prototypes based on the children’s designs. Our findings highlight design concepts that the research team – despite many years of pain-related research – had not considered in the context of paediatric logging, namely a) prioritizing children's privacy in social settings while using pain-logging tools; b) emphasizing personalization to boost engagement; and c) logging general well-being of children alongside pain intensity to collect more insightful data. These findings thus demonstrate the value of co-designing pain-logging technologies with children. ",

As the need to engage youth comfortable with texting increases, mental health providers are exploring and adopting text-based media such as chatbots, community-based forums, online therapies with licensed professionals, and helplines operated by trained responders.  To support these text-based media for mental health--particularly for crisis care--we are developing a system to perform passive emotion-sensing using a combination of keystroke dynamics and sentiment analysis. Our early studies of this system posit that the analysis of short text messages and keyboard typing patterns can provide emotion information that may be used to support both clients and responders. We use our preliminary findings to discuss the way forward for applying AI to support mental health providers in providing better care.",

It investigates how emerging technologies, notably LLMs, reshape human perceptions and experiences via a series of material-driven design speculations. The research articulates three Research through Design projects that utilize thing-perspective text in their interaction to stimulate posthumanist reflection: `Beau,' the public robot; `Areca,' the everyday appliance; and `Kami,' the conversational agent. Beau and Areca have progressed from development to deployment studies, while Kami is in the design ideation phase. These projects are part of an iterative research journey, each encapsulating distinct questions, drawing on insights from preceding analyses. I aim to provide empirical insights into the dynamics between humans and technologically advanced things, encouraging researchers to adopt a posthumanist perspective to enrich their comprehension of human experiences in an increasingly entangled world.",

Initially formalized within Human-Computer Interaction in 2015, `physicalization' involves encoding data into tangible forms. Despite significant progress in addressing initial challenges, new complexities emerge from the dynamic interplay of technology and human interaction. Building on insights from a prior CHI 2023 workshop, which focused on exemplar domain applications, our workshop aims to facilitate in-depth discussions on overarching grand challenges. Specifically, we focus on four key challenges: privacy, temporality, collaborative sensemaking, and sustainability of physicalization design. These focal points acknowledge the susceptibility of physicalizations to privacy concerns, collaborative interpretation, temporal usage, and sustainability considerations. Through interactive and collaborative activities, the workshop seeks to advance understanding and strategies for addressing these emerging challenges in the realm of physicalization, ultimately contributing to the advancement of the field.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain can be debilitating, taking over our senses and potentially destroying our means of describing our experiences. In this pictorial, we contribute three concepts based on the analysis of autosomatographies, a first-person narrative approach from illness and disability studies to communicate experiences of pain. These concepts suggest designers consider pain as (a) self-agentic, (b) a tool for empowerment, and (c) a means of creative expression. We illustrate the generation of these concepts through the first author's autosomatographical journals, highlighting how visual research greatly contributes to articulating expressive felt qualities of pain for design use. To exemplify the translation of these concepts into tangible prototypes, we retrospectively analysed two soma design case studies created to appreciate our bodies and learn from pain. We discuss the importance of acknowledging the persistence of chronic pain and the ethics of engaging in this type of design work.",

RealityEffects enhances volumetric capture by introducing a novel method for augmenting captured physical motion with embedded, responsive visual effects, referred to as object-centric augmentation. In RealityEffects, users can interactively attach various visual effects to physical objects within the captured 3D scene, enabling these effects to dynamically move and animate in sync with the corresponding physical motion and body movements. The primary contribution of this paper is the development of a taxonomy for such object-centric augmentations, which includes annotated labels, highlighted objects, ghost effects, and trajectory visualization. This taxonomy is informed by an analysis of 120 edited videos featuring object-centric visual effects. The findings from our user study confirm that our direct manipulation techniques lower the barriers to editing and annotating volumetric captures, thereby enhancing interactive and engaging viewing experiences of 3D volumetric videos.",

      "abstract": "Through participating in our contemporary digitally-mediated society individuals are surveilled, generating data about them that is analyzed and aggregated to create computational models of their everyday habits, behaviors, desires, and anxieties. The concept of data intermediaries has recently been proposed and gained purchase as digital services that could enable people to have more control over what data is collected about them and how it is used. Yet, data intermediaries currently exist as a high-level aspirational concept. Little is known about how they could or should be designed; and, my doctoral research is oriented towards making contributions precisely at this gap. Stage 1 of my PhD research proposes a diverse range of concepts and scenarios that, taken together, offer a range of possibilities and consequences that personal data, shaped by data intermediaries, might hold for mediating data exchanges in people’s everyday lives. Stage 2 mobilizes lessons learned from Stage 1 to create and conduct participatory workshops with teenagers focused on envisioning how their individual and collective desires could better supported within the data economy. Stage 3 focuses on the creation and deployment of design artifacts that give form to and speculate on potential tensions, anxieties, benefits, and desires revealed through participatory workshops with teenagers in stage 2.

The facilitators first take participants on a 3 hours, 4 kilometers walkshop to learn what being immersed in the urban space of Copenhagen can tell us about the relationship between the human body, architectural space, and digital space. Participants engage in activities meant to make them observe, reflect, and discuss how human space in the 21st century is a blend of the physical and the digital. In the afternoon, a mapping and reflection session transforms morning notes into maps to trace how the experience of participants blended (or did not blend) digital and physical, what worked well or did not, where structures provided guidance or engendered confusion, where information was punctual, where it was missing, superabundant, misleading",

      "abstract": "Effective meetings are effortful, but traditional videoconferencing systems offer little support for reducing this effort across the meeting lifecycle. Generative AI (GenAI) has the potential to radically redefine meetings by augmenting intentional meeting behaviors. CoExplorer, our novel adaptive meeting prototype, preemptively generates likely phases that meetings would undergo, tools that allow capturing attendees’ thoughts before the meeting, and for each phase, window layouts, and appropriate applications and files. Using CoExplorer as a technology probe in a guided walkthrough, we studied its potential in a sample of participants from a global technology company. Our findings suggest that GenAI has the potential to help meetings stay on track and reduce workload, although concerns were raised about users’ agency, trust, and possible disruption to traditional meeting norms. We discuss these concerns and their design implications for the development of GenAI meeting technology.",

One vital field is data science, including feature engineering (FE), where both human ingenuity and AI capabilities play pivotal roles. \r\nDespite the existence of AI-generated recommendations for FE, there remains a limited understanding of how to effectively integrate and utilize humans' and AI's knowledge.\r\nTo address this gap, we design a readily usable prototype, human\\&AI-assisted FE in Jupyter notebooks. It harnesses the strengths of humans and AI to provide feature suggestions to users, seamlessly integrating these recommendations into practical workflows.\r\nUsing the prototype as a research probe, we conducted an exploratory study to gain valuable insights into data science practitioners' perceptions, usage patterns, and their potential needs when presented with feature suggestions from both humans and AI. \r\nThrough qualitative analysis, we discovered that the \"Creator\" of the feature (i.e., AI or human) significantly influences users' feature selection, and the semantic clarity of the suggested feature greatly impacts its adoption rate. Furthermore, our findings indicate that users perceive both differences and complementarity between features generated by humans and those generated by AI. Lastly, based on our study results, we derived a set of design recommendations for future human & AI FE design.\r\nOur findings unveil vast collaborative potential between humans and AI in the field of FE.

Our formative study identified two challenges of the LLM-based wearable email assistant: (i) achieving efficient and accurate understanding of user intentions, and (ii) ensuring effective information presentation for email processes. Through two empirical studies, we developed a \"Single Turn with Optional Clarification\" approach for accurate user intention recognition and a \"Fade Context with Optional Audio\" mode for effective email processing. An observation study then evaluated GlassMail’s feasibility in composing formal and semi-formal emails, supporting the usefulness and effectiveness of GlassMail in simple scenarios and yielding insights into potential future improvements for complex scenarios. We further discuss the design implications for the future development of wearable AI-enabled assistants.\r\n",

However, the adoption of PRS is impeded by significant challenges, such as existing health disparities and concerns around the accuracy and privacy risks of the use of personal genomic data. My thesis explores the critical role of understanding public perceptions of PRS to effectively integrate it, utilising design methods to demystify the technology and foster relatability – and thereby explore scenarios around the future everyday use of PRS and get input from the public into the design of new personalised health services. Employing a methodology of online surveys, semi-structured interviews, and workshops, I aim to open up a space for discussion, which connects PRS services with public usage through design methods – innovative engagement and provocative conversation.",

Yet, many citizen science platforms are designed for national or global nature data collection. How local knowledge of wildlife can be effectively assembled to support this is an open question.  This study explored what a localised nature network might look like and how to design for what people care about, notice, record, and share. We undertook research with 14 participants in an inner-city location, using interviews and a variety of technology probes. We found that participants’ social and physical boundaries, values regarding family and community, and diverse questions impacted human-nature relations and nature data collection. Speculated physical-digital networks indicated novel combinations of platforms and technologies to drive ongoing engagement and learning. This study contributes insight into how nature data is formed by the realities of locality, and how a fractured nature/data landscape might be mended.",

While various technology solutions have been developed to support self-management of women with GDM, usability and functionality limitations have precluded their adoption. More active engagement with women with GDM in the design process could mitigate these limitations, thus we developed a design method to support the involvement of women with GDM in the design phase of a GDM self-management system. Thirteen online workshops were conducted involving five women with GDM and two postpartum women with previous GDM, who participated in idea generation, paper-based sketching, and group discussions, followed by interviews to gather their experiences of participation. We found that women valued their inclusion in these design workshops and felt confident sharing their ideas, from which we introduce recommendations for design procedures that enhance the contributions of women with GDM in the design of self-management apps.

      "abstract": "Smart home cameras (SHCs) offer convenience and security to users, but also cause greater privacy concerns than other sensors due to constant collection and processing of sensitive data. Moreover, privacy perceptions may differ between primary users and other users at home. To address these issues, we developed three physical cover prototypes for SHCs: Manual, Hybrid, and Automatic, based on design criteria of observability, understandability, and tangibility. With 90 SHC users, we ran an online survey using video vignettes of the prototypes. We evaluated how the physical covers alleviated privacy concerns by measuring perceived creepiness and trustworthiness. Our results show that the physical covers were well received, even though primary SHC users valued always-on surveillance. We advocate for the integration of physical covers into future SHC designs, emphasizing their potential to establish a shared understanding of surveillance status. Additionally, we provide design recommendations to support this proposition.",

To explore possible scenarios and usages of olfactory social robots, we employ a novel method, Olfactory Puppetry—puppetry that integrates olfaction, with two approaches. Through our experimental journey, we understand how people envision and what they expect of olfactory robots, as well as fostering discussions on what new interactions could be made possible. We believe such discussions would trigger creative ideas and suggest design directions, serving as a meaningful starting point for designing olfactory HRIs.",

However, existing platforms for crowdsourced mobile broadband measurements are not designed to engage workers over time or space, which can lead to spatial misrepresentation and stale data. With the insight that games and play offer naturally engaging frameworks for users, we held five iterative, participatory design sessions with 11 participants to co-design a catalog of 11 game concepts that could be used to create more spatially representative mobile broadband data sets. Importantly, we found that while games varied substantially with respect to theme, all used a few common game mechanics to incorporate mobile broadband data collection into play. This indicates that a designed prototype might focus on offering a customizable gaming structure that would allow communities and individuals to create thematic content that could overlay onto a set of common mechanics that could support more representative geospatial data collection.",

      "abstract": "The natural oyster reefs in the North Sea are disappearing. Oyster reefs provide food, breeding grounds, nursery areas, hiding places and shelter for numerous species that are experiencing habitat decline. By converting oyster shells that have been removed from the sea for consumption into shell paste structures and placing these in the sea, we playfully speculate that new habitats could be supported. As well as speculating on how the material could be returned, this project also highlights the complexity of involving the material, the oyster, the oyster farmer, and the designer in speculative engagements with the environment, industry and the sea itself. We propose a playful demonstration of inviting the audience to participate in making their own speculative habitable structures using low-tech technology. These structures will then be placed in the sea at the end of the exhibition.",

Though task guidance systems have proven beneficial in many domains for improving task performance and reducing user frustration, there is a lack of general guidelines and design principles for their development. Prior work has shown that recipe-based cooking is a strong medium for studying task planning and execution. In response, we conducted a contextual inquiry study in home kitchens, observing eight different participants’ cooking sessions. We used affinity diagramming of our notes and transcripts to identify common obstacles faced by participants and establish user needs in the areas of object interaction, safety, knowledge base, and task coordination. We discuss how these findings can inform the design of technology-driven solutions for task guidance systems beyond cooking.",

The user study revealed that participants enjoyed the experience, indicating its potential usefulness in the early stages of music production, while providing feedback for further improvements. Future work will focus on enhancing the model's accuracy and explainability, as well as evaluating the tool's usability and its impact on creativity support for novices among a broader and more diverse user base.",

Despite their global adoption and recognized benefits, there is a research gap regarding the current context and dynamics of MDT Meetings (MDTMs), hindering the design of systems tailored to this context. This study delves into cancer MDTMs, highlighting emerging practices and challenges. We conducted an observational study across three hospitals, uncovering the intricate interplay of organizational, technological, and interpersonal factors. Our insights emphasize the complexities of MDTMs, including physical infrastructure, MDTM's discussion structure, and adaptability, revealing challenges in information management and turn-taking strategies. By addressing these dimensions, our aim is to inform the development of more efficient and effective MDTMs in healthcare.",

EasyGO provided both audio and screen interaction methods for users to add items, receive navigation information, and identify items. This research assesses the usability of EasyGO through interviews and user testing, providing a comprehensive understanding of the real-world application and user experience of the application. Participants preferred a combined screen and audio cues system for navigation. They appreciated the proactive nature of audio cues, finding it less distracting and more efficient than having to periodically check a screen display. The combination of screen and audio cues (C2) emerged as the most favored mode of navigation information delivery among all participants, and they also preferred audio-only (C3) over screen-only delivery.",

This pictorial reports on how the Doughnut Economics model can be applied as a tool for facilitating complex stakeholder engagement. We present a novel visual framework and facilitation method to enable systemic and values-led thinking in the context of establishing a new interdisciplinary academic institution. Using a participatory design process, 115 stakeholders from academic, research, and administrative backgrounds explored this model over two studio sessions, co-creating an institutional compass to navigate the socio-ethical challenges of their professional practices. We leverage the pictorial format to (i) demonstrate the application of the Doughnut Economics model as an effective visual framework for fostering structured dialogue to surface shared and contesting values and boundaries and (ii) facilitate complex stakeholder engagement through a systemic design journey that encourages emergent dialogue.

This affects young adults and leads to long-term personal damage (i.e., career, reputation, and family). Current strategies on social media platforms fall short of addressing this problem. We engaged 20 young adults (18-34) through a participatory design approach in co-designing solutions that reflect their concerns, needs, and desires. Participants were divided into three groups based on their cyberbullying experience as victim, discloser, or attacker. Our partic- ipants designed 15 solutions for prevention, intervention, support, and awareness. These solutions reveal the need for privacy control, anonymity, and autonomy for victims, a restorative justice system, social media accountability, and the involvement of influencers and content creators in awareness and education. We provide im- plications for progressive and adaptive social media awareness campaigns, a compassionate justice system, and soft control of personal information ownership.",

      "abstract": "This paper illuminates the obscured labor and challenges of actors—those vitalizing virtual characters through their embodied performances through motion capture (mocap) technology. Mocap in the entertainment industry has amplified the presence of virtual entities across various media platforms. Despite the expanding influence of such technologies, the mocap actors behind them often remain unseen and, at times, under-compensated. Central is the paradox where the realism and vitality of virtual characters contrast sharply with the obscured, and sometimes undervalued, human efforts behind them. We present an empirical study based on semi-structured interviews with fourteen actors, offering a nuanced understanding of their lived experiences. We highlight the multifaceted precarity they face, which includes navigating the market, preserving artistic integrity, and vulnerabilities as employees. By juxtaposing these findings with established discourses on invisible labor, we discuss three major invisibility factors. Furthermore, we propose design interventions to empower and rightfully recognize human labor. ",

This work investigates the challenges in collecting community data on pressing social issues and utilizing institutional civic data towards purposes that challenge the status quo. Stemming from a four year engagement with local housing activists, my research begins from the standpoint of tenant organizing spanning multiple projects. The investigation is conducted in the context of rapid gentrification and Private Equity acquisitions of residential properties that continues to climax as the Covid-19 pandemic plays out and leaves behind socio-economic and cultural residualities. I rely upon methods from the anthropological shift to \"Study Up,\" viewing data from a design perspective to unpack how to design bricolage infrastructure of eviction mutual aid, data visualizations that identify plaintiffs (landlords) over defendants (tenants), and scaffolding community data collection against the court.",

Although prior studies highlight the role of morphology in shaping children’s perceptions of these machines, there is little research to examine their perceptions of social robots in various contexts. Our research investigates how different morphologies (anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and mechanomorphic) influence children's emotional responses. We involved 36 children (9-11 years old) in a design fiction-based study examining how morphology impacts children’s hopes and fears of social robots in varying scenarios and contexts, categorising the results into four distinct themes that represent children’s general perceptions (autonomy, cognition, socio-emotional, and physical). From this, we identify two distinct design challenges, and discuss how these may impact both researchers general users of social robots with children. Further, we emphasise the need for careful and considerate deployment of social robots for children in both research and real-world applications.",

      "abstract": "The number of older adults who are homebound with depressive symptoms is increasing. Due to their homebound status, they have limited access to trained mental healthcare support, which leaves this support often to untrained family caregivers. To increase access, a growing interest is placed on using technology-mediated solutions, such as voice-assisted intelligent personal assistants (VIPAs), to deliver mental health services to older adults. To better understand how older adults and family caregivers intend to interact with a VIPA for mental health interventions, we conducted a participatory design study during which 6 older adults and 7 caregivers designed VIPA-human dialogues for various scenarios. Using conversation style preferences as a starting point, we present aspects of human-likeness older adults and family caregivers perceived as helpful or uncanny, specifically in the context of the delivery of mental health interventions, which helps inform potential roles VIPAs can play in mental healthcare for older adults.",

Emerging work explores how we might define, measure, and evaluate constructiveness of communication, and through practice, it is clear that apart from the topic and style of contribution, how participants engage in relationship to one another is key. Do they build upon what others have said, offer new ideas, impact other's contributions? With such complexity is an opportunity ripe for design intervention and exploration. In this paper, we present our conversation visualization tool to support our development of constructive communication metrics. We explore responsivity between participants as a measure of constructive communication, and discuss implications of exploring relationship in metrics and visualization of conversation.\r\n ",

      "abstract": "Designing plant-driven actuators presents an opportunity to create new types of devices that grow, age, and decay, such as robots that embody these qualities in their physical structure. Plant-robot hybrids that grow and decay incorporate unpredictable and gradual\r\ntransformations inherent across living organisms and suggest an alternative to the design principles of immediacy, responsiveness, control, accuracy, and durability commonly found in robotic design. To explore this, we present a design space of primitives for plant-driven robotic actuators. Proof-of-concept prototypes illustrate how concepts like slow change, slow movement, decay, and destruction can be incorporated into robotic forms. We describe the design considerations required for building plant-driven actuators for robots, including experimental findings regarding the mechanical properties of plant forces. Finally, we speculate on the potential benefits of plant-robot hybrids to interactive domains such as robotics.",

      "abstract": "Medical braces and assistive wearables serve critical functions in supporting mobility and aiding individuals with temporary disabilities. However, these devices often lack aesthetic appeal and fail to provide personal expression, leading to psychological challenges and social stigma. We propose a novel fabrication method, Fabric-Lego, which combines 3D-printing with traditional garment-making (pattern-making, sewing, ironing, and overlocking) to address these shortcomings. By integrating customizable Lego®-like blocks into wearable fabrics in accessible DIY ways, users can personalize their wearables while maintaining comfort and functionality. We present the fabrication process, including insights on materiality, pre-processing, 3D-printing, and post-processing steps. To demonstrate the design space and potential applications of our method, we implemented 3 prototypes: 1) a customizable arm sling cover, 2) a customizable finger splint cover, and 3) a T-shirt with integrated blocks. This approach offers a promising path for enhancing the user experience and empowering individuals to embrace their unique identities.",

Key open questions are how to design such interactions and the role personal goals and expectations play. We developed three AI partners of varying initiative (leader, follower, shifting) in a collaborative game called Geometry Friends. We conducted a within-subjects experiment with 60 participants to assess personal AI partner preference and performance satisfaction as well as perceived warmth and competence of AI partners. Results show that AI partners following human initiative are perceived as warmer and more collaborative. However, some participants preferred AI leaders for their independence and speed, despite being seen as less friendly. This suggests that assigning a leadership role to the AI partner may be suitable for time-sensitive scenarios. We identify design factors for developing collaborative AI agents with varying levels of initiative to create more effective human-AI teams that consider context and individual preference.",

There is a need for rapid means to prototype tangibles in order to facilitate research and design. To this end, we designed ProtoBricks: a research toolkit that uses capacitive bricks to facilitate rapid prototyping for tangible interfaces. Utilizing toy bricks that do not contain electronics, ProtoBricks can record brick position and color. Specialized knowledge is not required to build our system as it uses widely available components and 3D printing. We contribute the full software and hardware specification of the toolkit. We evaluate the utility of the toolkit by reporting on past use cases and prototyping workshops. We show that the toolkit facilitates creativity and effectively supports prototyping. ProtoBricks lowers the entry threshold for experimenting with tangible interfaces and enables researchers and designers to focus on the interaction with their prototype, delegating implementation to the toolkit.",

This paper aimed to understand how to incorporate context into designing mHealth systems for fatigue management. We conducted a two-week field study with 20 fatigue-vulnerable individuals using an activity-tracking sensor and self-reporting. We conducted data-prompted interviews to explore phenomena about participants’ fatigue experiences. Findings show a heterogeneous relationship between context and fatigue, which can be attributed to the phenomena that: (1) participants were influenced by multiple fatigue-inducing factors for different durations; (2) broad contexts moderated participants’ perceptions and coping strategies in response to local contexts; (3) the predictability and repetition of activities influenced participants’ fatigue perception and coping strategies. We propose a context-informed layer-based framework integrating these phenomena and discuss implications for designing fatigue management tools informed by our framework.",

      "abstract": "Conversational agents have gained widespread popularity due to their ability to simulate and sustain contextual conversations. Prior works predominantly focused on computational challenges. However, avatars — the representation of the agent — impact user interactions and perception of conversational agents' trustworthiness and usefulness. Despite their importance, we lack a holistic understanding of conversational agent avatar design space. In this work, we address this gap by defining a categorization of 10 dimensions that is based on the analysis and iterative coding of 266 conversational agent papers from 160 venues spanning 2003 to the present. In addition, we built an interactive browser to facilitate exploration and interaction with these dimensions and their interrelationships. Our categorization lays the groundwork for researchers, designers, and practitioners to discern task-specific and contextual aspects of conversational agent avatar design. Our work fosters innovative ideas to facilitate new interactions with avatars by surfacing current patterns and highlighting open challenges.",

      "abstract": "Participatory Design (PD) aims to create technological solutions that improve users’ lives and to foster users’ empowerment. While PD has received extensive attention regarding its processes and methods, less research exists on the effects of PD. With the increasing inclusion of Extended Reality (XR) into PD, this gap necessitates a critical analysis of how and to which end XR can be best used in PD activities to achieve the desired effects. Through the analysis of 16 XR prototyping workshops, we explore the impact of immersive and non-immersive XR prototyping on PD effects. Furthermore, we delineate differences between the immersive and non-immersive approaches. Our work contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the effects of XR prototyping for PD, rooted in theoretical and empirical insights. It further illustrates what each approach offers and presents design considerations to assist practitioners in successfully integrating XR prototyping into their design practice.",

To date, however, there has yet to be a structured agenda for CyclingHCI to clarify the immediate challenges researchers should address next and facilitate the advancement of the field. To advance the development of CyclingHCI, we employed expert sessions with three CyclingHCI experts responsible for the design, development, evaluation, and reflection on the societal implications of 18 CyclingHCI systems. Our analysis led us to 10 grand challenges with design opportunities and considerations grouped as (1) Pushing the technological boundaries for cycling, (2) Understanding and protecting cyclists, and (3) Spatially situated cycling interaction. Our findings provide practical implications for research and practice in designing for CyclingHCI, with which we aim to advance CyclingHCI and enrich the cycling experience through the safe integration of technology.",

To get children interested in, excited about, and inspired by biomimicry, we introduce KiPneu, a robotic platform that facilitates biomimicry education through hands-on, solution-oriented learning and a digital learning environment. KiPneu allows children to mimic flexible animal locomotion, like fish swimming or worm squirming, using low-cost building blocks and non-electrical pneumatic actuators. We provide five types of non-electrical tangible valves to adjust robot motion characteristics, such as direction and speed, through engaging tangible programming. Additionally, to facilitate the whole learning process, KiPneu comes with interactive instructional interface that visualize and simulate the pneumatic system. To validate KiPneu's educational efficacy, we conducted a three-day workshop with 21 children aged 5-12. Pre-and-post surveys revealed KiPneu not only enhanced their understanding of animal locomotion mechanisms but also spurred interest in creative construction using acquired knowledge.",

Through qualitative interviews, observation, and visual documentation, this case study explores the consideration of sustainability in purchasing decisions, use, maintenance, and disposal processes of digital devices used in a North American university as well the institution’s related policies and procedures and faculty members’ practices. Through this research we find tensions that complicate sustainability in the university research context. We develop a rich description of the complexities of creating sustainable practices, policies, and procedures in a university setting as a step towards becoming more sustainable in our work and in our institutions, and we offer a set of recommendations for our academic institution and systems that both advance and thwart efforts to create sustainable practices.",

With Textile ID, we envision a digital garment passport that seamlessly incorporates directly into textile surfaces as a design element to bridge the gap between sustainability and consumer engagement, transforming garments into interactive storytellers of their ecological journey. The visual surface of the garment can be scanned with a smartphone to access a unique identifier embedded within the fabric, which provides essential information about the product's lifecycle. This work discusses the design space of various visual and textile parameters, proposes design possibilities and insights for implementation. Finally, we showcase a set of sample garment designs and provide design recommendations for designers to use in their future work.",

Designed to support Personhood through a blended physical/digital installation, it is a user-led experience, centered around video and closely facilitated in concert with expert arts practitioners. The narrative and duration of the interaction is guided by each resident, unique on each viewing, which includes ‘sensory props’ that guide each resident’s experience and stimulate the senses to create a transformative space. We provide a worked example of digital, physical, and spatial design decisions taken to reinforce Personhood for residents with advanced dementia. We present learnings from 106 sessions, facilitated one to one between Artists and residents. We contribute to the literature around designing to Materialize Personhood, informed by Kitwood’s 12 key characteristics, as well as Parametricism, a novel approach to non-linear experiences, to support the unique needs of people with advanced dementia.",

      "abstract": "The heightened emphasis on a healthy and sustainable lifestyle has led to a surge in the popularity of cycling and an increased interest in integrating emerging technologies into the cycling experience.  Despite its promising potential and the advancements in leveraging Augmented Reality (AR) for cycling assistance, a significant gap exists in understanding cyclists' perspectives, preferences, and concerns regarding AR technology.  This paper aims to address this gap through in-depth interviews with eight cyclists, seeking to uncover potential benefits and challenges across six themes.  These themes encompass addressing safety concerns, optimising navigation and training performance, facilitating biomechanical adjustments, and enhancing group cycling dynamics.  We anticipate that the initial insights gained from these interviews will guide future researchers and practitioners interested in exploring the intersection of cycling and AR technology.",

By forecasting energy production and consumption, energy community members can share energy with their peers to achieve local environmental, economic, and social benefits. Despite hopes that energy community projects will promote justice, P2P energy-sharing and related infrastructures may exacerbate injustices related to energy access, community participation, and recognition of rights. We present Just Share It!, a speculative tablet-based P2P energy-sharing system. This system questions how we might design for energy justice by presenting users with choices for P2P energy-sharing grounded in research on energy community justice. In doing this, we discuss how HCI might design for justice in energy transitions, as well as tensions that may arise.",

However, the rise of culturally-responsive in-person and digital behavioral health resources for NA communities provides new opportunities to address these longstanding health equity issues. The major challenge is helping people in NA communities find these meaningful resources and helping anchor institutions understand how resources are being sought and utilized to support more responsive internal programming. In this context, we have partnered with Hopi Behavioral Health Services (HBHS) to design  the Resilience Resource Database to digitally disseminate mental and behavioral health resources. This paper presents initial findings that have resulted from the initial stage of an iterative participatory design process with HBHS.",

Understanding how individuals experience and cope with online manipulation is essential to support evolved design practices and regulatory measures. Yet studies on populations who may be more vulnerable to online manipulation are scarce. \r\nThrough a series of ``magic machines'' workshops, we investigated the experiences of older adults (N=31) with online manipulation, their needs, and the strategies they imagine to resist manipulative practices. Our results show that participants tend to attribute manipulation to an ``unknown'' person and do not distinguish platforms from content. Through their machines, they expressed four primary needs to resist manipulation: knowledge, awareness, right to sanctuary, and control. \r\nOur study contributes insights into older adults' experiences with online manipulation and brings design challenges for effective countermeasures to manipulation that address the needs of all users.",

Sociological research has demonstrated how technology-induced temporality introduces challenges at the individual and societal levels. Art creativity conflicts with speed and mass production. This paper describes Isotta, a critical artefact combining a Mignon typewriter and a Language Model to spark discussion about ML-induced acceleration. Fourteen artists evaluated Isotta in an interview study, and semiotics was used as the analytical lens. Results exposed ideological assumptions around the consequences of technology in the writing realm. We discuss these insights in the context of interactive design in times of techno-capitalistic acceleration. Our findings highlight the significance of temporal factors in designing generative writing interactions and underscore how complex societal challenges can be approached in design through the contrast-eliciting property that outdated technologies offer when juxtaposed with contemporary technologies.",

      "abstract": "Whilst there is increasing work investigating the role of digital documentation, interpretation, and augmentation of cultural heritage, such interventions have largely focused on visual and sometimes auditory modalities, neglecting the full spectrum of human senses. With this workshop we seek to bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers, designers, practitioners and community members to explore creative approaches for documenting and experiencing cultural heritage's rich sensory dimensions extending beyond visual-based approaches to encompass sound, smell, taste, and touch. The workshop directly aligns with the conference's exploration of \"Why Design?\" by utilising design as a powerful, empathetic, and participatory tool for safeguarding cultural heritage. Our goal is to extend our understanding of concepts, methods and technologies for capturing and experiencing sensory heritage, advocating for a holistic approach that celebrates and communicates the profound sensory diversity of human cultures, inspiring a shift in how we document, interpret and share cultural heritage.",

      "abstract": "Flexible working, including in resource-constrained settings such as long-haul flights, poses considerable challenges. While research in mixed reality (MR) offers the potential for enhancing experiences of working on airplanes (WoA), what input modalities and interactions might be suitable for such workspaces is under-explored. To address this gap, we created four design probes and demonstrated their interactions within MR for WoA using a branching decision-based interactive video. 24 participants engaged in the think-aloud study with the video where they selected which probe to watch based on personal preference and order. The follow-up interview further solidified their general preferences for intuitive and friction-free inputs, revealed strong concerns about reliability, discreetness, and portability, and showed high enthusiasm for interactive video. Based on these findings, we contribute a context-driven design space of input modalities for WoA in MR, extending the understanding of design opportunities for inputs with MR in confined spaces.",

      "abstract": "Understanding warehouse work is critical to “future of work” scholarship as warehouses are vital indicators for anticipating how work could be structured, controlled, and experienced in other data-driven workplaces in the future. However, researchers often face challenges in studying and designing interventions in such work environments, particularly ones where non-disclosure agreements and intensive, isolated, and precarious work conditions pose practical barriers to research access. By creating a set of speculative designs about warehouse work futures, we explore how speculative design techniques can be used to analyze and critically engage with on-going ethnographic research into warehouse work at Amazon fulfillment centers. These designs serve not only as a means for unpacking the logics of contemporary warehouse work but also as an approach to identify directions for worker-centered research and design in the future. This paper also provides sensibilities for using speculative design techniques to study hostile and labor-intensive work environments. ",

      "abstract": "Protecting children’s online privacy is paramount. Online platforms seek to enhance child privacy protection by implementing new classification systems into their content moderation practices. One prominent example is YouTube’s “made for kids” (MFK) classification. However, traditional content moderation focuses on managing content rather than users’ privacy; little is known about how users experience these classification systems. Thematically analyzing online discussions about YouTube’s MFK classification system, we present a case study on content creators’ and consumers’ experiences. We found that creators and consumers perceived MFK classification as misaligned with their actual practices, creators encountered unexpected consequences of practicing labeling, and creators and consumers identified MFK classification’s intersections with other platform designs. Our findings shed light on an interwoven network of multiple classification systems that extends the original focus on child privacy to encompass broader child safety issues; these insights contribute to the design principles of child-centered safety within this intricate network.

      "abstract": "Through an autoethnographic account of designing, exhibiting, and maintaining an interactive bioart installation with plants, we trace intersections between more-than-human design, disability theory, and lived experiences of chronic illness. Specifically, we deconstruct three \"polished\" exhibits of our installation through stories of breakdowns and failures, organized in three main themes: maintenance and care, buggy biodata, and collective resistance to purification and control. Our reflections show how plants, technologies, and a chronically ill body became entangled with each other conceptually and materially, surfacing new sites for more-than-human relationalities. In our discussion, we unpack how disability perspectives can expand more-than-human design practices, highlight opportunities for re-imagining exhibition spaces, and offer adaptation as a strategy for design in HCI.",

      "abstract": "Negative emotions such as sadness or anger are often seen as something to be avoided. However, recognising, processing and regulating challenging emotional experiences can facilitate personal growth and is essential for long-term well-being. To support people in regulating and reflecting on negative emotions, we designed MoodShaper — a VR experience where participants autonomously create a virtual environment combined with emotion regulation (ER) interventions. Our system included three different interventions designed based on interviews with psychotherapists. We evaluated MoodShaper in a mixed-method between-subject study with $n=60$ participants. Participants experienced one of the three ER interventions, allowing them to manipulate visual representations of negative emotions through either externalisation, seclusion, or appreciation. We found that MoodShaper significantly increased positive affect while decreasing difficulties in ER and negative affect. Our work demonstrates how VR can provide technology-mediated support to reflect on, engage with and manage negative emotions. We contribute insights for future VR systems which support ER for challenging situations.",

At the same time, the act of making happens behind-the-scenes, often overlooked, outsourced or rushed through. We would like to propose a one-day workshop of making at DIS. Specifically, we propose the making of samplers as a site for constructing a shared space to contemplate the interplay of memory and imagination in design research, inspired by traditional needlework samplers as well as modern subversive stitchwork \\cite{subversive}. By making together, we aim to take time to consider our personal and collective commitments and stance within and outside our roles as design researchers. \r\n\\end{abstract}",

      "abstract": "Clients often partner with AI experts to develop AI applications tailored to their needs. In these partnerships, careful planning and clear communication are critical, as inaccurate or incomplete specifications can result in misaligned model characteristics, expensive reworks, and potential friction between collaborators. Unfortunately, given the complexity of requirements ranging from functionality, data, and governance, effective guidelines for collaborative specification of requirements in client-AI expert collaborations are missing. In this work, we introduce AINeedsPlanner, a workbook that AI experts and clients can use to facilitate effective interchange of clear specifications. The workbook is based on (1) an interview of 10 completed AI application project teams, which identifies and characterizes steps in AI application planning and (2) a study with 12 AI experts, which defines a taxonomy of AI experts’ information needs and dimensions that affect the information needs. Finally, we demonstrate the workbook’s utility with two case studies in real-world settings.",

      "abstract": "Novel end-user programming (EUP) tools enable on-the-fly (i.e., spontaneous, easy, and rapid) creation of interactions with robotic systems. These tools are expected to empower users in determining system behavior, although very little is understood about how end users perceive, experience, and use these systems. In this paper, we seek to address this gap by investigating end-user experience with on-the-fly robot EUP. We trained 21 end users to use an existing on-the-fly EUP tool, asked them to create robot interactions for four scenarios, and assessed their overall experience. Our findings provide insight into how these systems should be designed to better support end-user experience with on-the-fly EUP, focusing on user interaction with an automatic program synthesizer that resolves imprecise user input, the use of multimodal inputs to express user intent, and the general process of programming a robot.",

      "abstract": "Generative AI technologies demand new practical and critical competencies, which call on design to respond to and foster these. We present an exploratory study guided by Research-through-Design, in which we partnered with a primary school to develop a constructionist curriculum centered on students interacting with a generative AI technology. We provide a detailed account of the design of and outputs from the curriculum and learning materials, finding centrally that the reflexive and prolonged 'hands-on' approach led to a co-development of students' practical and critical competencies. From the study, we contribute guidance for designing constructionist approaches to generative AI technology education; further arguing to do so with 'critical responsivity.' We then discuss how HCI researchers may leverage constructionist strategies in designing interactions with generative AI technologies; and suggest that Research-through-Design can play an important role as a 'rapid response methodology' capable of reacting to fast-evolving, disruptive technologies such as generative AI.",

However, we rarely discuss how we return to these collections to look for starting points and new understandings. In this provocation, we propose diffraction as a way to describe how we revisit and reconsider samples in different times and contexts. In doing so, we can imagine what other knowledge might be present in them and interpret what else they might do. We use the example of the development of a filtering textile, based on a set of woven samples developed for other purposes and projects. Through this, we show how a relatively simple strategy can support us to investigate material samples and collections through a kind of makers' science, in which both inspiration and proof may lie in the material samples themselves.",

Our experience tells a different story. In this provocation, we argue that the role of facilitator needs to be carefully considered and performed. We propose an active role for facilitators where they may encourage or challenge the process, allow risk, handle vulnerabilities (including their own), and assist in articulating the unknown, unclear, and hazy, as it emerges. To do this, facilitators acknowledge their own presence and concerns, while simultaneously handling processual ethics and iterative consent. We counterbalance the tendency to offer workshop guidelines by offering instead ten permissions for design activities that acknowledge the role of the facilitator and, inspired by Judith Butler’s thought on accountability, open up to moments of unknowingness.",

Bridging this contrast, pairs of smart objects, equipped with only simple sensors and actuators, may support peripheral and emotional awareness. At the same time, how exactly such pairs should negotiate the soft/smart spectrum to yield positive long-term impacts for people connecting through them is a design challenge. We engage this with the Wheel of Plush co-design toolkit. It enables 8x8 different sensor-actuator combinations in plush for co-designers to explore multimodal interactions for smart soft toy pairs connected over distance. We detail our design process and offer insights on designing a toolkit that combines artisanal plush material with simple sensors and actuators. With the Wheel of Plush, we contribute a toolkit for exploring smart soft toy materiality, data-frugal multimodal interaction, and opportunities for smart soft toy pair co-design.\r\n",

Previous research investigated online shoppers' purchasing behaviors in sustainability and healthy eating. However, current research in alcohol is limited to modifying simulated platforms to aid in the increase of purchasing lower alcoholic beverages by altering product offerings. We conducted a heuristic evaluation on online shopping platforms highlighting the use of sludge, before developing five design intervention prototypes. We then iterated on these interventions through an online alcohol purchasing questionnaire (N=20) and two follow-up activities (N=11) (interview with design probes; product swap questionnaire), evaluating how the interventions could counter sludge. Our goal is to develop interventions that engage light to moderate drinkers in alcohol reduction. We found participants want a greater presence of alcohol units and product grading imagery in conjunction with neutral-toned health warnings.",

      "abstract": "The surge in access to and awareness of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) such as ChatGPT has sparked discussion over the necessary technological literacies and competencies needed to effectively engage with these systems. In this context, we explore AI as a tool that mediates cultural understanding and remediates human values -- that are often influenced by biases and inequities. Using participatory design for learning with a group of 13 children (ages 8-13), we engaged in five co-design sessions featuring different modalities for socio-cultural approaches to AI literacy. We found that children were more aware of the cultural mediation aspect of AI when the content of the interaction aligned with their cultural background and context. This underscored the significance of aligning the representation of culture in these GenAI systems with people's socio-cultural ecosystems in modern technological literacies. We conclude with design principles for a more critical and holistic approach to AI literacy.",

      "abstract": "As generative artificial intelligence (genAI) applications gain popularity, there is a dearth of research examining how applications may transform social interactions. One possible application set to transform social interactions is the use of generative speech to power AI agents that can realistically represent people. Our work examines the potential implications of AI agents representing individuals in human conversations (\"agent representation\") as a way to begin filling this research gap. We take a multi-method approach, conducting formative interviews with developers, a co-design workshop with designers, a harm analysis among researchers, and interviews with the general public. Both technologists and potential users worry adopting agent representations might harm the quality, trust, and autonomy of human communication. Potential users are particularly concerned that agent representations could undermine the value of social interaction and threaten individuals’ ability to control their image. To avoid such potential consequences, future genAI-powered agents and speech applications should take into account user-defined red lines when considering applying these technologies in social settings.",

As these Mixed Reality (MR) worlds develop quickly we need to reflect on how human values are incorporated into the design and deployment of the technology. Human values map our perception of the world, reflect attitudes, guide behaviours, and provide us with social and moral grounding. However, there is limited research on incorporating values in the design of MR technologies. This research has three contributions: (1) a playful values-driven workshop design, (2) insights into the values of different groups of people in diverse MR scenarios, and (3) recommendations for incorporating human values for future MR design and application. This work will contribute to improving the ethical and responsible development of current and future MR applications.",

Bioluminescent algae are unicellular microorganisms that produce light in response to kinetic stimuli and have been a focus of design and HCI research when exploring expressivity of living media. This study advances prior work using bioluminescent algae through designing and engineering a Living Light Interface comprising of bio-kinetic pixels. The resulting interactive system translates digital input into the biological domain by modulating the bioluminescent mechanism and creating different pixel states. The kinetic design of the vibration module uses adjustable weights to induce a wide range of lighting patterns. The hardware design is coupled with organism-centric algorithms, which allow for the generation of dynamic light patterns across the interface. The paper provides a comprehensive visual narrative of a design process that brings these living organisms to the forefront of our technological imagination, blurring the boundaries between biology, algorithmic control, and tangible interfaces.",

The question-and-answer (QA) style articles are effective for researchers to promote their research by enabling readers to understand research on complex subjects. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened avenues for supporting researchers in creating QA-style articles for research promotion. However, without the authors' involvement, these models may only partially capture the researcher's intention and voice. We developed AQUA, a research probe that enables researchers to co-create QA-style articles with LLMs to promote their research papers. A user study (n=12) reveals that LLMs reduced authors' burden and helped them understand the readers' perspectives. Nevertheless, LLMs failed to capture the unique intent of the authors, and their automated generation discouraged authors from carefully revising their answers. Based on our findings, we discuss human-LLM interaction design to enable authors to create QA-style articles that reflect their intention.",

      "abstract": "In a process of Research-through-Design two art digital jewellery pieces were created on the same bespoke IoT device that connects a person with the sea: a hand-held piece (SeaVessel) and a necklace (Thalassa). Drawing on the notion of atmosphere, the design development (2020-21) and the first author’s lived experience with the pieces (2021-2022) are illustrated and narrated. We share insights into how the pieces augmented intimacy with a significant place and offer a space for self-reflection for the first author to explore their connection with the sea and ultimately the self. We offer insights gained from working with IoT, live data and online servers in such a poetic context.  We contribute to experiential approaches to designing reflective and curious ways of interacting with digital technology with the notion of atmosphere as a concept for aesthetics for interaction design and an understanding of data as poetic data.",

      "abstract": "Improving accuracy, time spent, and ubiquity of delineation has been a long-standing design aim, yet many HCI works have overlooked high-stakes and complex healthcare annotation. We explore contouring, a critical workflow aimed at identifying and segmenting tumors, usually performed on immobile desktop computers in clinics, in which limited support for mobile access leads to prolonged and subpar treatment planning. Following interviews and think-aloud studies (N=10 physicians), we report key contouring behaviors, and later design a novel cross-device prototype that enables contouring on everyday touch devices. We compared contouring via desktop and touch in a lab study (N=8 residents) and found that mobile phones not only yielded similar accuracy, but also took significantly less time. Our results point to three broad design guidelines for cross-device solutions deployed within standalone healthcare workflows, and highlight how incorporating different device and input modalities can improve treatment delivery in today's distributed healthcare environments.",

Resistive Threads is an interactive denim jacket that refashions the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project's (Dis)location Black Exodus print zine. The jacket plays audio stories, poetry, and music from embedded speakers when interactive patches sewn with conductive thread are tapped upon. Examining the artifact with 10 community organizers and partners, we find that augmented streetwear may take on the role of a housing organizing instrument or speculative garment. In turn, we discuss how we might learn from textile histories and solidarities to recognize—not rehearse—damage-centered research. We close with a reflection on what makes the electronic aspect of e-textiles meaningful to social movement practice and performance.",

GenAI, capable of creating new content such as images, text, music, video, and code, raises important questions about authorship, agency, and design practice. Inspired by Roland Barthes' \"The Death of the Author,\" this workshop examines how GenAI reshapes design research roles and methods. Key topics include best practices, ethical considerations, knowledge generation, and collaboration patterns between human and AI creatives.\r\n\r\nBuilding on themes identified in the successful DIS 2023 workshop, this 2-day event invites designers and researchers to present completed projects, works-in-progress, and theoretical provocations. The structure allows time for both presentations and in-depth discussions, aiming to develop an online resource library and a collaborative publication. The workshop seeks to advance the discourse on GenAI, addressing its challenges and opportunities in design research.",

However, the diversity of shape-changing behaviors achievable with these materials remains unclear as the fabrication knowledge is scattered across multiple research fields. This paper introduces SoftBioMorph, a fabrication framework that aims to integrate the fabrication know-how of sustainable soft shape-changing interfaces with biopolymers. Based on the example of Sodium Alginate, the framework contributes (1) a set of material synthesis processes that modify the biopolymer's properties to fulfill different functions; (2) a set of DIY crafting-based assembling techniques that functionalize the material and assembling properties to achieve three primitive types of change in shape; and (3) a series of application cases that demonstrate the versatility of the framework. We further discuss limitations, research questions, and fabrication challenges, presenting a comprehensive approach to sustainable prototyping in HCI.",

      "abstract": "Generative AI brings novel and impressive abilities to help people in everyday tasks. There are many AI workflows that solve real and complex problems by chaining AI outputs together with human interaction. Although there is an undeniable lure of AI, it is uncertain how useful generative AI workflows are after the novelty wears off. Additionally, workflows built with generative AI have the potential to be easily customized to fit users' individual needs, but do users take advantage of this? We conducted a three-week longitudinal study with 12 users to understand the familiarization and customization of generative AI tools for science communication. Our study revealed that there exists a familiarization phase, during which users were exploring the novel capabilities of the workflow and discovering which aspects they found useful. After this phase, users understood the workflow and were able to anticipate the outputs. Surprisingly, after familiarization the perceived utility of the system was rated higher than before, indicating that the perceived utility of AI is not just a novelty effect. The increase in benefits mainly comes from end-users' ability to customize prompts, and thus potentially appropriate the system to their own needs. This points to a future where generative AI systems can allow us to design for appropriation.",

However, individuals in multi-person households often find themselves navigating daily life by coordinating with other members. This article aims to understand how users align their preferences for shared technology and their expectations for future smart homes in such contexts. To this end, we conducted a 7-day diary study and in-depth interviews to observe how members of multi-person households coordinate their preferences in everyday life. We discovered that members' device usage is not solely influenced by their own preferences, but is significantly affected by the preferences and social contexts of other members. We identified three strategies for coordinating preferences: coordination according to shared priorities, coordination according to shared rules, and coordination for relationships. Participants expected future smart homes to support their coordination needs. We propose design implications for multi-user smart homes that support coordination.",

MoSS is composed by a number of software and hardware components, allowing people to customize, modify and modulate its synthetic voice in real-time. Through playfully combining the different tools and parameters, MoSS facilitates an investigation of human/machine interaction with voice controlled smart home objects, with a focus on the exploration of sound and voice synthesis. We present the process leading the creation of MoSS, how it works and the preliminary results from using the device to inspire novel vocal imaginaries in synthetic voice design. ",

Recent research has demonstrated their potential to act as conduits for digital interactions with microgestures, however, the primary focus was on situations where the hand firmly grasps an object. We introduce GraspUI, an exploratory design space of object-centric gestures within the seven distinct phases of the grasping process, spanning pre-, during, and post-grasp movements. We conducted ideation sessions with mixed-reality designers from industry and academia to explore gesture integration throughout the entire grasping process. The outcome was 38 storyboards envisioning practical applications. To evaluate the design space’s utility, we performed a video-based assessment with end-users. We then implemented an interactive prototype and quantified the overhead cost of performing proposed gestures through a secondary study. Participants reacted positively to gestures and could integrate them into existing usage of objects. To conclude, we highlight technical and usability guidelines for implementing and extending GraspUI systems.",

While there has been an increase in understanding how people across racial groups create community across different platforms, there is still a lack of studies that explicitly center on how Black technologists design with and for their own communities. In this paper, we present findings from a series of semi-structured interviews with Black technologists who have used, created, or curated resources to support lived Black experiences. From their experiences, we find a multifaceted approach to design as a means of survival, to stay connected, for cultural significance, and to bask in celebratory joy. Further, we provide considerations that emphasize the need for centering lived Black experiences in design and share approaches that can empower the broader research community to conduct further inquiries into design focused on those in the margins. \r\n\r\n",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates sound and music interactions arising from the use of electromyography (EMG) to instrumentalise signals from muscle exertion of the human body. We situate EMG within a family of embodied interaction modalities, where it occupies a middle ground, considered as a \"signal from the inside'' compared with external observations of the body (e.g., motion capture), but also seen as more volitional than neurological states recorded by brain electroencephalogram (EEG). To understand the messiness of gestural interaction afforded by EMG, we revisit the phenomenological turn in HCI, reading Paul Dourish's work on the transparency of \"ready-to-hand'' technologies against the grain of recent posthumanist theories, which offer a performative interpretation of musical entanglements between bodies, signals, and representations. We take music performance as a use case, reporting on the opportunities and constraints posed by EMG in workshop-based studies of vocal, instrumental, and electronic practices. We observe that across our diverse range of musical subjects, they consistently challenged notions of EMG as a transparent tool that directly registered the state of the body, reporting instead that it took on \"present-at-hand'' qualities, defamiliarising the performer's own sense of themselves and reconfiguring their embodied practice.",

      "abstract": "Climate change poses unique challenges and opportunities for the design of human-centered smart buildings. Developments in innovative programmable materials can address some of the challenges of creating passive buildings whilst cultivating more responsible human-climate relationships. Yet, their potential in the context of climate change remains relatively underexplored by the Human-Computer Interaction and Human Building Interaction research communities. This workshop invites proposals that rethink the design of physical human-data interactions in our built environment in the increasingly urgent context of climate change. The workshop will include opportunities to present and discuss participants’ research and design work, followed by a ‘mapping the research landscape’ exercise, and a video design-fiction prototyping session. The anticipated outcome of the workshop will be a new design agenda for HCI/HBI research in response to climate change, which will be of critical relevance to people designing and developing smart buildings, cities and urban infrastructures.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the design and outcomes of SketchPath, a system that uses hand-drawn toolpaths to design for clay 3D printing. Drawing, as a direct manipulation technique, allows artists to design with the expressiveness of CAM-based tools without needing to work with a numerical system or constrained system. SketchPath works to provide artists with direct control over the outcomes of their form by not abstracting away machine operations or constraining the kinds of artifacts that can be produced. Artifacts produced with SketchPath emerge at a unique intersection of manual qualities and machine precision, creating works that blend handmade and machine aesthetics. In interactions with our system, ceramicists without a background in CAD/CAM were able to produce more complex forms with limited training, suggesting the future of CAM-based fabrication design can take on a wider range of modalities.

We placed our original prototype, SnuggleBot, unsupervised into the homes of seven people for at least 7 weeks (optionally up to 6 months), with bi-weekly interviews, to investigate how people engage with our three robot interaction strategies. Our qualitative analysis illuminated how people engaged the robot based on all three interaction strategies. Further, some participants showed signs of bonding with the robot as well as self-reported wellbeing benefits, while some participants failed to achieve sustained use over time. Our results provide strong support for future research into robots developed with our interaction strategies, and general potential for supporting wellbeing.",

Contributing to this problem is the fact that people often talk past one another. Recent advances in generative AI may help to democratize this process of designing for public spaces and enable people to meaningfully converse with one another. Here, we develop a platform that asks users to submit a photo and story about a place in their community that they cherish. The system then pairs the user with a target person whose preferences conflict with the users' preferences, and users read this target person's account. Users then use our generative AI system to redesign a space to accommodate the target person. Preliminary studies demonstrate that the act of redesigning the space may lead to greater empathy for the target person, which may help advance conversations around public spaces.",

      "abstract": "Algorithmic systems that provide quantitative assessments of labor practices have proliferated in response to growing calls for accountability and transparency. Workers, according to the existing literature, are able to make sense of algorithmic metrics and even find ways to manipulate them. Human reactions like these show how metrics for tracking and measuring labor productivity can have unintended consequences, such as gaming the system, beyond the original goal of collecting accurate data on worker output. However, these metrics’ effects have not been much discussed from the perspective of reactivity. Drawing from Espeland and Sauder’s work theorizing reactivity to measures, I offer a deeper understanding of responses to algorithmic systems. Distilling three intertwined facets from their insights—quantification towards accountability, agency, and reflexivity—I frame my fieldwork findings on warehouse workers’ experiences with labor-tracking technologies. I describe the patterns of algorithmic system effects. Lastly, I explore potential design directions, viewed through the lens of reactivity.\r\n\r\n",

However, it also triggers social, cultural, and ecological concerns and inequities like data colonialism and data extractivism. In this provocation, we unweave the hegemonic trends of data and data practices, which generate capitalist and anthropocentric knowledge and narrow socio-technological imaginaries. We suggest alternative approaches to spin new data threads that might enable us to include alternative epistemologies and knowledges, other-than-human communities and entities, aiming for worlds where the focus is on he good life of all, rather than just enhancing humanity. We also address the significance of means-oriented design practice for exploring these challenging spaces and engaging with more researchers and practitioners in HCI to reweave plural worlds. ",

This one-day workshop will provide a space for HCI researchers and technology designers to reflect on the timelines that govern their work and explore where and how ethical issues emerge. In drawing on real-world ethical dilemmas that participants have experienced, we hope to better understand how power dynamics and hierarchies can constrain or accelerate ethical decision making and consider the wider context and systems surrounding these processes. Through playful, creative experimentation, community building, and the use of non-violent communication and systems thinking tools, this workshop aims to build participants’ agency and inspire collective action. We also hope to promote change in the design practices and norms that perpetuate harm.",

This paper expands sleep technology to address more complex notions of sleep, proposing dream technology as a path for reflective practices that focus on nightly dreams rather than hours slept. Because dreams are ‘bizarre’ and hard to grasp we turn to speculative design practices in an RtD framework to investigate the nature of dreaming.  This process produced the ‘dream sticker machine’, a design proposal that visualises a user's dreams with an AI image generator. This tangible dream trace becomes sharable in both public and personal spaces. This proposal formed the basis of a probe to how people might imagine their dreams taking form in the real world, and led to ideas for how the materials of dreams might be taken up as part of design research practice.

While sticks are widely used in everyday objects, their applications as a TUI in XR have not been systematically studied. We conducted a participatory design session with twelve experts in XR and Human-Computer Interaction to investigate the affordances of stick-based objects and how to utilize them in XR. As a result, we presented a taxonomy of stick-based objects' affordances in terms of their functions and holding gestures. Following that, we proposed four types of stick-based XR controller forms and discussed their advantages and limitations. In the end, we juxtaposed twenty-six existing XR controllers against our proposed forms and identified Landed (Cane) Stick, Thin Stick's flexible usages, and Modular Design as the major opportunities that remain unexamined yet for stick-based XR TUI design.",

At the same time, physical inactivity is a big societal challenge and dedicated urban planning and design can contribute to more active lifestyles. In this paper, we investigate how user-generated big data can support designers in shaping more activity-friendly and adaptive environments, addressing both timely challenges. Bridging the fields of HCI and urbanism, we introduce two data lenses. The individual lens primarily builds on empathic design skills and calls for a highly personal approach. The collective lens emphasizes systematic and holistic design skills, focusing on creating overview and surfacing collective interests. Through exploratory data visualizations, using a large dataset from a run-tracking smartphone application combined with public data sources, and a workshop, we investigate how these lenses can yield meaningful insights. We discuss the value of these lenses to the urban design and HCI communities and address the challenges and opportunities that arise at the cross-section of these perspectives. ",

      "abstract": "While social relationships are important for human well-being, maintaining these relationships can be difficult, especially for individuals living apart from friends and loved ones. We present \"Light Bridge\", an ambient spatial interaction concept designed to convey a sense of closeness and co-presence through changes in ambient lighting that reflect the partner's location and activity, thus providing a subtle form of communication that blends seamlessly into daily routines. We tested our concept in a Wizard-of-Oz study with pairs of subjects in a separated locations (N=20) with a controlled protocol of activities to mimic a daily routine. Our study addressed four questions: social connectedness, privacy, distraction and joint action motivation. The results showed that ambient light can effectively convey a sense of physical closeness between separated individuals without causing distraction or irritation in terms of privacy. The study provides valuable insights regarding the potential of ambient spatial interaction in smart homes to improve the sense of social connectedness.",

      "abstract": "Goods are designed, produced, and eventually purchased by consumers who will typically use them as their marketing and branding suggests. What happens when, instead, existing products are used to provide the foundational components for novel devices?  We argue that post-consumer product reuse should be a central and ongoing concern in the design of interactive devices. This paper examines four case studies of interactive devices produced by reusing and repurposing existing consumer products. By critically analyzing these case studies, we demonstrate how reuse is leveraged in practice to exploit macro and micro economic niches. These case studies illustrate factors beyond noble ecological intent that make reuse sustainable: mechanical robustness, affordability, and technological bootstrapping. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities inherent to this mode of production.",

      "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that many deployed AI systems do not sufficiently support end-user interaction and information needs. Engaging end-users in the design of these systems can reveal user needs and expectations, yet effective ways of engaging end-users in the AI explanation design remain under-explored. To address this gap, we developed a design method, called \\textit{AI-DEC}, that defines four dimensions of AI explanations that are critical to the integration of AI systems in the workplace---communication content, modality, frequency, and direction---and offers design examples for end-users to design AI explanations that meet their needs. We evaluated this method through co-design sessions with workers in healthcare, finance, and management industries who regularly use AI systems in their daily work. Findings indicate that the AI-DEC effectively supported workers in designing explanations that accommodated diverse levels of performance and autonomy needs, which varied depending on the AI system's workplace role and worker values. We discuss the implications of using the AI-DEC for the user-centered design of AI explanations in real-world systems.",

We believe that there is a common thread between work from many different researchers, but that the people doing that work are spread across different disciplines and geographical locations.

However, current data exploration paradigms, such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), heavily rely on visualizations to unveil patterns and insights. This visual-centric approach poses significant challenges for blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals. To address this gap, we built a prototype that supports non-visual data exploration and conducted an observational user study involving 18 BLV participants. Participants were asked to conduct various analytical tasks, as well as free exploration of provided datasets. The study findings provide insights into the factors influencing inefficient data exploration and characterizations of BLV participants' analytical behaviors. We conclude by highlighting future avenues of research for the design of data exploration tools for BLV users.",

So called ‘smart’ Internet of Things (IoT) devices, now ubiquitous in our homes, are increasingly contributing to this waste stream, due to their lack of repairability and consumer cycles driven by planned obsolescence. However, other electronic household products, such as gaming devices, are often used and cared for by their owners for far longer than other IoT devices, whose protean lifecycles are driven by fast moving, profit-focussed consumer markets. This paper argues that by developing a deeper understanding of the relationship between gamers and their devices, and the communities they inhabit, design practitioners and researchers can learn to engender the design of IoT products that foster emotional durability and care, and support the development of more sustainable repair practices, to tangibly improve the lifespans of next generation IoT products.",

This is especially problematic in cases where designers and users are not co-located and have to travel to participatory meetings. Distributed co-design through remote participation technologies has been hoped to alleviate these issues. However, distributed co-design has its own issues, such as requirement of an access to suitable technology independently by the participants. In this paper we present three cases where distributed co-design has been mediated through WhatsApp\\textsuperscript{TM}, the currently most wide-spread mobile instant messaging app. Our lessons learned from these projects indicate that mobile instant messaging has potential in distributed co-design, and the continuous access to communication channels can enable detailed discussions between the designers and the participants. To summarise our findings, we present a framework to help future academics and practitioners to plan and implement (part of) their co-design process in mobile instant messaging services.",

      "abstract": "How To Train Your Drone is a novel human-drone interaction that demonstrates the generative potential of a design metaphor: the umwelt. We describe the concept of the umwelt and detail how we applied it to inform our soma design process, creating an interactive space where somatic understandings between human and drone could emerge. The system was deployed for a month into a shared household. We describe how three people explored and shaped the umwelts of their drones, leading to unique and intimate human-drone couplings. We discuss the compatibility of the umwelt to soma design practice and identify future avenues for research inspired by artificial life and evolutionary robotics. As our contribution, we illustrate how the umwelt as a design metaphor, can open up a generative new design space for human-drone interaction.",

      "abstract": "GenFrame is an interactive picture frame that mimics traditional paintings while being equipped with generative AI capabilities. Painting \"portraits of a girl\" has been a trope in art history for centuries. However, in the era of generative AI models, the permanence of traditional art is challenged. When an AI model is able to mimic any painting style, it can also give agency to the viewer to repaint the painting per individual desires. In this installation, we modify the role of the museum placard to provide a minimal tangible interface to change the style of the image and the mood of the depicted girl. In this way, the generative AI model is interfaced in tangible ways, instead of the regular prompt paradigm.\r\nDemo video available here: https://youtu.be/ga7pFgAOPiY",

      "abstract": "Interactions between the physical and the digital have become increasingly ubiquitous. They are particularly challenging to visualize and illustrate, as they usually unfold over time and space and involve multiple devices, locations, services, and actors. Traditional approaches to sketching user experiences and storyboarding fall short of clearly illustrating how meaningful relationships between people, things, technology, and places are created when they are consistently transitioning from physical spaces into digital spaces and back again. To address this gap, the pictorial showcases how a design framework based on blending theory informs our illustrative best practices and techniques for Art Directing Blended Experiences. The pictorial further discusses the opportunities and challenges of this narrative sketching technique to help designers further explore and capture the essence of how things, relationships, people, and change weave together new personal social spaces and deeper meanings of physical place.

We developed a low-fidelity prototyping tool to support this design work and describe our experiences of using this tool in a workshop with a car manufacturer. We share the co-designed patterns that we developed: re-engaging in driving; dis-engaging from driving; saying farewell; and being held while turning. Our analysis contributes design knowledge on how we should design for a car seat to `touch' larger, potentially heavier parts of the body including the back, shoulders, hips, and bottom. The non-habitual experience of shape-changing elements in the driver seat helped pinpoint the link between somatic experience and intelligent rational behaviour in driving tasks. Relevant meaning-making processes arose when the two were aligned, improving on the holistic coming together of driver, car, and the road travelled.",

To help conceptualise associations between thermal perception and affective experience, we turn to \\emph{Cí poetry}, a form of classical Chinese literature rich with evocative descriptions of embodied, environmentally situated, first-person experience.\r\nWe conducted a lexical analysis to identify thermal-affective associations, and propose a design framework addressing thermal design and evaluation. We demonstrate the value of this framework via analysis of existing thermal design exemplars.",

However, insufficient studies investigate the experience and design space of AI image technology (AIGT) applications for playful urban interaction, despite its widespread adoption. To explore this gap, we conducted an exploratory study involving four participants who wandered and photographed within Eindhoven Centre and interacted with an image-to-image AI. Preliminary findings present their observations, the effect of their familiarity with places, and how AIGT becomes an explorer's tool or co-speculator. We then highlight AIGT's capability of supporting playfulness, reimaginations, and rediscoveries of places through defamiliarizing and familiarizing cityscapes. Additionally, we propose the metaphor AIGT as a 'tourist' to discuss its opportunities for engaging explorations and risks of stereotyping places. Collectively, our research provides initial empirical insights and design considerations, inspiring future HCI endeavors for creating urban play with generative AI.",

One of the challenges is designing Mixed Reality application-specific experiences in the wild. In this paper, we present a structured reflection approach to revisit projects from the past. In applying this structured reflection to the data collected during a nine-month industrial project, we unveiled the Virtuality-Reality Clash. To generate a sufficient data corpus, we structurally analysed git commits, tickets, emails, handwritten notes, and weekly snapshots of the 3D designs. The clash could be narrowed down in our data corpus to the situations in which we were fusing the real environment with the virtual content. Finally, we could find five design patterns for MR experience. With these patterns, we aim to help developers and designers of MR applications identify situations where Virtuality and Reality clash and propose approaches to address them.",

      "abstract": "Personal Informatics (PI) systems like self-trackers implicitly or explicitly judge user behaviour based on the data they collect. In a behaviour change context, this may help individuals recognise corrective actions to take. However, these value judgments are unnecessary or harmful in some situations, for instance when (a) the user does not use the self-tracker with an intent to change, (b) the user needs to reflect more deeply on their data to achieve their desired change, or (c) the user's behaviour or intended use case is non-normative. In this provocation, we aim to challenge the normative status quo by offering reflections on alternative, \"non-judgmental\" ways to represent self-tracking systems interfaces. We present three design concepts to support these reflections. We discuss what makes PI systems judgmental by detangling the elements embedding judgment, and the relations between judgmental and normative. Is it even possible to remove all value judgments from PI systems after all? ",

      "abstract": "Recently, various digital solutions have emerged to enhance the process of self-reflection, which can be crucial for personal growth and resilience. However, whether technology can meaningfully match or augment a traditional approach like pen or paper remains to be ascertained. Our objective was to build an better understanding of design paradigms' role in introspection. Through formative iterations, informed by Self-Determination Theory (SDT), we designed and developed different tool formulations (\\textit{Analogue}, \\textit{Digital}, and \\textit{Hybrid}) for comparison. Participants (\\textit{N} = 48) received one variant, completing a pre- and post-six-week assessment with the Self Reflection and Insight Scale (SRIS) and intermediary self-reports for qualitative feedback. We found scores for \\textit{Hybrid} and \\textit{Digital} conditions change significantly, suggesting format decisions have meaningful impacts on the efficacy of designs to alter intrinsic motivation toward introspective behaviour. We also identify determinants and design considerations to help others conceive solutions to support or stimulate a component of broader well-being.",

Different home objects can be augmented to facilitate different types of exercises at home. However, there is a lack of research investigating how home objects can be augmented into non-exercise-related objects, and how they should be tailored depending on the exercise. To obtain such insights, we conducted a study involving a design activity and focus group discussion. We found common categories of personal motivation for augmentation of home objects, how properties of the home object and movement of the exercise should be considered for augmentation, and how augmentation should include physically meaningful and engaging interactions, to ensure effective exercising and exergaming in AR at home. Our results contribute to the existing body of research by providing designers with factors to consider when selecting potential augmentations.",

      "abstract": "Robots in urban environments will inevitably encounter situations beyond their capabilities (e.g., delivery robots unable to press traffic light buttons), necessitating bystander assistance. These spontaneous collaborations possess challenges distinct from traditional human-robot collaboration, requiring design investigation and tailored interaction strategies. This study investigates playful help-seeking as a strategy to encourage such bystander assistance. We compared our designed playful help-seeking concepts against two existing robot help-seeking strategies: verbal speech and emotional expression. To assess these strategies and their impact on bystanders' experience and attitudes towards urban robots, we conducted a virtual reality evaluation study with 24 participants. Playful help-seeking enhanced people's willingness to help robots, a tendency more pronounced in scenarios requiring greater physical effort. Verbal help-seeking was perceived less polite, raising stronger discomfort assessments. Emotional expression help-seeking elicited empathy while leading to lower cognitive trust. The triangulation of quantitative and qualitative results highlights considerations for robot help-seeking from bystanders.",

As DIS gains interest in interactions with living organisms and more-than-human design goals, we reflect upon these trends and call for practices that surface nonhuman perspectives and critically draw out our own. We propose tracing as a material practice that surfaces insights on care and relation in the rich space between the human-designer and organism. Through reflective writings, we present a first-person account of tracing slime mold through visualizations, embodied experiences, and sonifying electrical resistance. These tracings capture both the slime mold's ways and our own, inviting us to observe our actions to facilitate its life. By tracing our experiences of growing and making with slime mold, we re-orient toward nonhuman perspectives and discuss how such practices might advance capacities of design research.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Take a deep breath; what do you smell? While sight and hearing dominate our perceptions, the sense of smell is often overlooked, even undervalued. However, the importance of our sense of smell goes beyond detecting odours. It shapes our emotions, memories, behaviour, and quality of life. Recent advances in olfactory interfaces have sparked discussions about the future of smell in human-computer interaction. While efforts mainly focus on the realization of new olfactory interfaces, here we collectively explore alternative worlds centred around the sense of smell. First, we conducted a design futuring workshop involving individuals with varying smell capabilities and expertise to envision and discuss smell-centred futures. Then, through iterative reflection, we arrived at three smell worlds presented as narratives and visuals. From this conceptual work, we offer new perspectives and generative possibilities for design research that prioritizes our noses.",

In this paper, we investigate such a collaboration with the use of emerging generative AI tools, and we explore how they may help in achieving agreement and semantic convergence between designers. We conducted workshops using Text-to-Image AI with design students and found that in addition to known advantages of brainstorming, the text prompts required by the AI system engaged students in verbal articulations that aided their design process. In collaborative contexts, the generated images shifted the centre of attention for team members to reach convergence through sharing their interpretations. We conclude that text-to-image AI can be beneficial for students' design processes as a catalyst for brainstorming rather than a tool for generating design imagery and presentations.",

Since then, a rich body of work has contributed with critical views and design considerations for designing self-tracking technologies to improve one’s health and wellbeing. Most recently, HCI researchers have highlighted a trend for Spiritual Informatics but work in religious and spiritual (R/S) contexts is rather limited, highlighting a gap in understanding how self-tracking technologies could be designed for R/S practice. This provocation presents a critique of two market exemplars that incorporate tracking functionalities for monitoring and supporting prayer or worship activities in two R/S contexts: Catholicism and Islam. These exemplars are discussed in light of previous work in Personal Informatics to critically conceptualise an interaction design space for supporting R/S practice and people’s spiritual journey.",

Through participant observation and semi-structured interviews with 13 members of the online forum r/bisexual on Reddit, we found participants collaboratively constructing an understanding of bisexuality. We found this knowledge-building fills an epistemic gap resulting from bisexuality often being poorly understood. When individuals do not possess knowledge key to understanding their own lives, this can be seen as hermeneutical injustice – a type of epistemic injustice. We use the lens of hermeneutical injustice to shed light on participants’ experiences on r/bisexual. Our work contributes to recent research on epistemic injustice in HCI by looking at how members of r/bisexual mitigate epistemic injustice by reclaiming residuality – the space outside the gay-straight binary. We also discuss considerations for hermeneutical injustice to inform the design of online communities and HCI research practice.",

      "abstract": "Human-AI interaction in text production increases complexity in authorship. In two empirical studies (n1 = 30 & n2 = 96), we investigate authorship and ownership in human-AI collaboration for personalized language generation. We show an AI Ghostwriter Effect: Users do not consider themselves the owners and authors of AI-generated text but refrain from publicly declaring AI authorship. Personalization of AI-generated texts did not impact the AI Ghostwriter Effect, and higher levels of participants’ influence on texts increased their sense of ownership. Participants were more likely to attribute ownership to supposedly human ghostwriters than AI ghostwriters, resulting in a higher ownership-authorship discrepancy for human ghostwriters. Rationalizations for authorship in AI ghostwriters and human ghostwriters were similar. We discuss how our findings relate to psychological ownership and human-AI interaction to lay the foundations for adapting authorship frameworks and user interfaces in AI in text-generation tasks.",

      "abstract": "Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have potential to provide effective and accessible care to entire populations, but low client uptake and engagement are significant problems. Few prior studies explore the lived experiences of non-engagers, because reaching this population is inherently difficult. We present an observational inquiry into the barriers to sign-up and early use of a DMHI, along with reasons for initial interest in the DMHI. We collected 205 online questionnaire responses and 20 interviews from self-referring participants across four healthcare ecosystems in the UK and US. Questionnaire results revealed that uncertainty about DMHI usefulness and usability were the main barriers to uptake, whereas forgetting about it, not finding time for it and not finding it useful were the main barriers to early engagement. Participants reported multiple reasons for considering the DMHI, reflecting the contextual, subjective nature of mental health. Our thematic analysis generated themes around (1) the need for human connection, (2) the impact of self-stigma on help-seeking, (3) the lack of knowledge around DMHIs and psychological therapy, (4) the desire for personally relevant care, and (5) the fluctuating, perennial nature of mental health. We discuss implications for DMHI design, implementation and future research, as well as transdisciplinary opportunities.",

      "abstract": "Although physical artifacts that represent data have been used for centuries, the research field—known as data physicalization—has only recently gained traction. Compared to data visualization, there is no established vocabulary for analyzing and discussing the properties of physicalizations. Through a grounded analysis of examples and literature, we propose a comprehensive design vocabulary, which consist of three separate, but connected parts: explicit variables, implicit properties, and consequential aspects. Explicit variables build on visual variables known from visualization and extend it to account for physicalization’s multi-modal nature. Implicit properties concern elements which are central to the design intention and user experience of physicalizations, yet are not a result of “explicit” encoding strategies. Finally, consequential aspects refer to unintentional effects of design decisions, that influence how a physicalization is experienced. Our work illustrates how physicalizations incorporate opportunities and challenges that are not afforded in other data representations, such as embodiment and imagined touch. With this, we contribute to generating theory on physicalization. Our design vocabulary can support (1) creators through informing their design processes and highlighting design strategies, (2) educators, and (3) academics and practitioners to analyse existing physicalizations, and reflect on the impact of design decisions on interpretation and experience.",

      "abstract": "Searching for Us is a pervasive tangible narrative that integrates physical avatars, real-time data such as weather or traffic, and a non-linear, multiplayer narrative. It uses marionette-like avatars and RFID-tagged props to create a pervasive narrative experience that blurs the boundaries between physical and digital aspects of the story. The narrative can dynamically adjust through a server-based system, offering unique story fragments based on user interactions and environmental factors. By fostering performative interaction and collaborative storytelling, Searching for Us aims to deepen engagement with friendship, loyalty, and resilience themes. This experience aims to expand traditional interactive storytelling by encouraging users to engage with urban spaces and create dynamic narrative trajectories, ultimately seeking to offer a more meaningful and immersive storytelling experience.",

A set of musically responsive robots were built that could be accessed through existing online communication platforms, enabling their control from anywhere in the world. This resulted in a series of playful interactions which revealed underlying tensions in the systems that the world came to depend upon during the pandemic. I propose to bring several of the robots from this project to the DIS Playful Experiences Demotrack, allowing users both locally and from around the world to control them through musical sound. ",

      "abstract": "This paper presents Robots for Distant Musicians (RFDM), a project developed as part of a residency at the MICA Game Lab in Baltimore, Maryland in 2020-21. A set of musically responsive robots were built that could be accessed through existing online communication platforms, enabling their control from anywhere in the world. This resulted in a series of playful interactions which revealed underlying tensions in the systems that the world came to depend upon during the pandemic. I propose to bring several of the robots from this project to the DIS Playful Experiences Demotrack, allowing users both locally and from around the world to control them through musical sound. ",

In this demonstration, we build on top of our previous work and showcase a series of handcrafted PaperTouch swatches that convert simple physical interactions into touchscreen triggers. We also demonstrate how others can use simple stationary and materials to build such paper interfaces by hand. Through these swatches and live making demonstrations, we hope to demystify the PaperTouch approach for others.",

      "abstract": "PaperTouch is a tangible computing approach that translates interactions in the physical world to trigger touch events on a digital device with paper mechanisms. In this demonstration, we build on top of our previous work and showcase a series of handcrafted PaperTouch swatches that convert simple physical interactions into touchscreen triggers. We also demonstrate how others can use simple stationary and materials to build such paper interfaces by hand. Through these swatches and live making demonstrations, we hope to demystify the PaperTouch approach for others.",

Oyster reefs provide food, breeding grounds, nursery areas, hiding places and shelter for numerous species that are experiencing habitat decline. By converting oyster shells that have been removed from the sea for consumption into shell paste structures and placing these in the sea, we playfully speculate that new habitats could be supported. As well as speculating on how the material could be returned, this project also highlights the complexity of involving the material, the oyster, the oyster farmer, and the designer in speculative engagements with the environment, industry and the sea itself. We propose a playful demonstration of inviting the audience to participate in making their own speculative habitable structures using low-tech technology. These structures will then be placed in the sea at the end of the exhibition.",

      "abstract": "The natural oyster reefs in the North Sea are disappearing. Oyster reefs provide food, breeding grounds, nursery areas, hiding places and shelter for numerous species that are experiencing habitat decline. By converting oyster shells that have been removed from the sea for consumption into shell paste structures and placing these in the sea, we playfully speculate that new habitats could be supported. As well as speculating on how the material could be returned, this project also highlights the complexity of involving the material, the oyster, the oyster farmer, and the designer in speculative engagements with the environment, industry and the sea itself. We propose a playful demonstration of inviting the audience to participate in making their own speculative habitable structures using low-tech technology. These structures will then be placed in the sea at the end of the exhibition.",

Drawing, as a direct manipulation technique, allows artists to design with the expressiveness of CAM-based tools without needing to work with a numerical system or constrained system. SketchPath works to provide artists with direct control over the outcomes of their form by not abstracting away machine operations or constraining the kinds of artifacts that can be produced. Artifacts produced with SketchPath emerge at a unique intersection of manual qualities and machine precision, creating works that blend handmade and machine aesthetics. In interactions with our system, ceramicists without a background in CAD/CAM were able to produce more complex forms with limited training, suggesting the future of CAM-based fabrication design can take on a wider range of modalities.

MoSS is composed by a number of software and hardware components, allowing people to customize, modify and modulate its synthetic voice in real-time. Through playfully combining the different tools and parameters, MoSS facilitates an investigation of human/machine interaction with voice controlled smart home objects, with a focus on the exploration of sound and voice synthesis.
