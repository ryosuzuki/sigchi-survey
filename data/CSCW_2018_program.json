      "abstract": "Following a cancer diagnosis, patients must cope with numerous physical, emotional, and practical challenges. While health information exists to help patients learn how to manage these challenges, health information seeking often declines over time, recalling information is difficult, and limited time with healthcare providers can leave patients feeling uninformed about their illness. We designed MyPath to overcome these information access challenges. The mobile system offers personalized, dynamic, and trusted health information recommendations to help patients learn about and manage their cancer. Through a seven-month deployment study with breast cancer patients, we found that use of the application encouraged proactive health management behaviors, and identified factors that motivated technology adoption and abandonment. We discuss the implications of these results for facilitating use of mHealth tools by a rural patient population and the importance of scaling support to a large range of information needs. We use this work to demonstrate the value of personalized health information systems and to motivate future CSCW research developing personalized support systems for other health situations with complex information access models.",

      "abstract": "Collective socialization involves introducing new members to an organization as a group or cohort. In traditional offline organizations, collective socialization is a standard and effective socialization strategy. This article investigates the impact of collective socialization on newcomers’ motivation and learning in an online community and the effect it has on newcomers’ reaction to feedback from the community. One observational field study and two random-assignment experiments involving editing Wikipedia articles show that collective socialization altered the way newcomers responded to feedback from the community. The observational study of students editing Wikipedia articles as part of a classroom assignment found that those who worked relatively independently without peer support made more edits in response to critical, negative feedback, presumably to fix errors, whereas students who had peer support did not. Two experiments in which Mechanical Turk workers edited Wikipedia articles independently or in a group found that working in a group diffused the impact of both positive and negative feedback. We discuss these findings, which highlight the importance of considering the negative consequences of introducing a new socialization practice to an online community.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the changes in motivation factors in crowdsourced policymaking. By drawing on longitudinal data from a crowdsourced law reform, we show that people participated because they wanted to improve the law, learn, and solve problems. When crowdsourcing reached a saturation point, the motivation factors weakened and the crowd disengaged. Learning was the only factor that did not weaken. The participants learned while interacting with others, and the more actively the participants commented, the more likely they stayed engaged. Crowdsourced policymaking should thus be designed to support both epistemic and interactive aspects. While the crowd's motives were rooted in self-interest, their knowledge perspective showed common-good orientation, implying that rather than being dichotomous, motivation factors move on a continuum. The design of crowdsourced policymaking should support the dynamic nature of the process and the motivation factors driving it.",

      "abstract": "This paper studies commonalities in response across disasters in online social networks (OSNs) and Twitter specifically. After presenting an algorithm for extracting vocabularies across disasters, we extract type-specific vocabularies for terrorist attacks, earthquakes, and climate-related disasters between 2012 and 2017. Within similar disasters, commonalities emerge: terrorism responses reference the \"attack\" and law enforcement, earthquake responses mention the quake and its magnitude, and climate-related responses include safety and requests for aid. Across disaster types, tweets regularly mention victims/affected and prayer, consistent with communal coping and social support in crisis aftermath. Using these disaster-type vocabularies, we study Twitter as an alternate measure for severity, correlating casualties to Twitter volume. These vocabularies better correlate with casualties than baseline crisis lexica, especially in western countries. Twitter response and casualties diverge at the extreme, and Twitter response is stronger in Western countries, suggesting perceived severity is driven by additional factors.",

However, in this paper we emphasize the social and collaborative needs for PVI to fully integrate into society as equals. The study assesses how PVI collaborate with different types of sighted partners when shopping together. We chose to study grocery shopping because it is a critical and challenging task for PVI. We conducted field observations and in-depth interviews with five PVI and their sighted shopping partners, including spouses, caseworkers, and store-provided courtesy shoppers. We found several factors that modulated these collaborations with varying forms of common ground: 1) knowledge about how to assist PVI; 2) interpersonal knowledge resulting from common experience and interpersonal relationship history; and 3) knowledge of shopping as a practice. We discuss our findings with respect to the implications for designing collaborative interactions.",

      "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective method of scaling-up tasks previously reserved for a small set of experts. Accordingly, researchers in the large-scale online learning space have begun to employ crowdworkers to conduct research about large-scale, open online learning. We here report results from a crowdsourcing study (N=135) to evaluate the extent to which crowdworkers and MOOC learners behave comparably on lecture viewing and quiz tasks---the most utilized learning activities in MOOCs. This serves to (i) validate the assumption of previous research that crowdworkers are indeed reliable proxies of online learners and (ii) address the potential of employing crowdworkers as a means of online learning environment testing. Overall, we observe mixed results---in certain contexts (quiz performance and video watching behavior) crowdworkers appear to behave comparably to MOOC learners, and in other situations (interactions with in-video quizzes), their behaviors appear to be disparate. We conclude that future research should be cautious if employing crowdworkers to carry out learning tasks, as the two populations do not behave comparably on all learning-related activities.",

      "abstract": "Transgender individuals in the United States face significant threats to interpersonal safety; however, there has as yet been relatively little research in the HCI and CSCW communities to document transgender individuals’ experiences of technology-mediated safety and harm. In this study, we interviewed 12 transgender and non-binary individuals to understand how they find, create, and navigate safe spaces using technology. Managing safety was a universal concern for our transgender participants, and they experienced complex manifestations of harm through technology. We found that harmful experiences for trans users could arise as targeted or incidental affronts, as sourced from outsiders or insiders, and as directed against individuals or entire communities.. Notably, some violations implicated technology design, while others tapped broader social dynamics. Reading our findings through the notions of “space” and “place,” we unpack challenges and opportunities for building safer futures with transfolk, other vulnerable users, and their allies.",

Social computing researchers are increasingly interested in these studies that examine user behavior across different sites. For example, researchers have conducted multi-sited studies to understand user behavior across culture, language, and media. In such studies, researchers are challenged to develop and execute methodologies that allow them to navigate frameworks that enable comparisons among multiple sites. Researchers face challenges adapting their methodologies to handle diverse populations, regulations, large datasets and more.

      "abstract": "Novel collaborative technologies afford new modes of behavior, which are often not regulated by established social norms. In particular, shared augmented reality (AR) - where multiple users can create, attach, and interact with the same virtual elements embedded into the physical environment – has the potential to interrupt current social norms of behavior. The objective of our study is to shed light on the ways in which shared AR challenges existing behavioral expectations. Using a simulated lab experimental design, we performed a study of users’ interactions in a shared AR setting. Content analysis of participants’ interviews reveals users’ concerns over the preservation of their self- and social identity, as well as concerns related to personal space and the sense of psychological ownership over one’s body and belongings. Our findings also point to the need for regulation of shared AR spaces and design of the technology’s control mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "While having a step-by-step breakdown for a task—an action plan—helps people complete tasks, prior work has shown that people prefer not to make action plans for their own tasks. Getting planning support from others could be beneficial, but it is limited by how much domain knowledge people have about the task and how available they are. Our goal is to incorporate the benefits of having action plans in the complex domain of writing, while mitigating the time and effort costs of creating plans. To mitigate these costs, we introduce a vocabulary—a finite set of functions pertaining to writing tasks—as a cognitive scaffold that enables people with necessary context (e.g. collaborators) to generate action plans for others. We develop this vocabulary by analyzing 264 comments, and compare plans created using it with those created without any aid, in an online study with 768 comments (N=145) and a lab study with 96 comments (N=8). We show that using a vocabulary reduces planning time and effort and improves plan quality compared to unstructured planning, and opens the door for automation and task sharing for complex tasks.",

      "abstract": "Indirect disclosure strategies include hinting about an experience or a facet of one’s identity or relaying information explicitly but through another person. These strategies lend themselves to sharing stigmatized or sensitive experiences such as a pregnancy loss, mental illness, or abuse. Drawing on interviews with women in the U.S. who use social media and experienced pregnancy loss, we investigated factors guiding indirect disclosure decisions on social media. Our findings include 1) a typology of indirect disclosure strategies based on content obviousness, original content creator, and content sharer, and 2) an examination of indirect disclosure decision factors related to the self, audience, platform affordances, and temporality. We identify how people intentionally adapt social media and indirect disclosures to meet psychological (e.g., keeping a personal record) and social (e.g., feeling out the audience) needs associated with loss. We discuss implications for design and research, including features that support disclosures through proxy, and relevance for algorithmic detection and intervention. CAUTION: This paper includes quotes about pregnancy loss.",

Here we propose a set of dimensions that capture major components of many relationships -- derived both from relevant academic literature and people's everyday descriptions of their relationships. We first review prominent findings in sociology and social psychology, highlighting dimensions that have been widely used to categorize social relationships. Next, we examine the validity of these dimensions empirically in two crowd-sourced experiments. Ultimately, we arrive at a set of ten major dimensions that can be used to categorize relationships: similarity, trust, romance, social support, identity, respect, knowledge exchange, power, fun, and conflict. These ten dimensions, while not dispositive, offer higher resolution than existing models. Indeed, we show that one can more accurately predict missing links in a social graph by using these dimensions than by using a state-of-the-art link embeddedness method. We also describe tinghy.org, an online platform we built to collect data about how social media users perceive their online relationships, allowing us to examine these dimensions at scale. Overall, by proposing a new way of modeling social graphs, our work aims to contribute both to theory in network science and practice in the design of social-networking applications.",

      "abstract": "Behavior change systems help people manage their time online. These systems typically consist of a single static intervention, such as a timer or site blocker, to persuade users to behave in ways consistent with their stated goals. However, static interventions decline in effectiveness over time as users begin to ignore them. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of static interventions to a rotation strategy, where users experience different interventions over time. We built and deployed a browser extension called HabitLab, which features many interventions that the user can enable across social media and other web sites to control their time spent browsing. We ran three in-the-wild field experiments on HabitLab to compare static interventions to rotated interventions. Rotating between interventions increased effectiveness as measured by time on site, but also increased attrition: more users uninstalled HabitLab. To minimize attrition, we introduced a just-in-time information design about rotation. This design reduced attrition rates by half. With this research, we suggest that interaction design, paired with rotation of behavior change interventions, can help users gain control of their online habits.",

Gaining knowledge about service landscapes is particularly difficult because they are often complex, non-transparent, and fragmented. We address this gap through an interview study of 19 U.S. parents regarding how they navigated health services for their young children, and how they gained competence in navigation practices. We describe a similar process all participants went through including four inherently iterative stages: seeking and integrating knowledge, decision-making, encountering breakdowns, and repairing and reflecting. We further elucidate what constitutes navigational competence, or the creation of resources about how to navigate, for our participants. We discuss how our study could advance understanding of navigation practices, and the importance for HCI design to support these complex yet essential navigation practices and the accumulation of navigational competence.",

      "abstract": "Many people’s social media feeds include posts in languages they do not understand. While previous research has examined bilingual social media users’ language choices, little research has focused on how people make sense of foreign language posts. In the present study, we interviewed 23 undergraduate social media users about how they consume and make sense of posts in other languages. Interviewees reported that they often did not pay attention to or engage with foreign language posts, due to a lack of relevance and contextual knowledge. When they did actively engage with foreign language posts, interviewees did not rely solely on machine translation output but instead actively collected and combined various cues from within and outside the post in order to understand what it was about. Interviewees further reported different types of goals for trying to make sense of foreign language posts; some focused on simply extracting and understanding the emotional components of a post while others tried to gain a fuller understanding of a post, including its contextual and cultural meanings. Based on these findings, we suggest design possibilities that could better aid multilingual communication in social media.",

      "abstract": "With recent shifts from email to messaging apps for personal communication, many communication partners are no longer able to converse using multiple threads within one platform as they used to via email. Romantic couples are the most frequently messaged contacts on mobile and communicate about a wide range of topics with each other, need to make joint decisions, and may have several roles in relation to each other (e.g., spouse, co-parent). Through a 3-week field study with ten U.S. diverse couples we studied how couples use a messaging app that allows them to compartmentalize their conversations into multiple “channels” around topics of their choice. We detail how couples managed and used channels in daily life, and channels’ strengths and limitations. We found that channels made couples feel more organized, and helped with finding content and keeping track of topics. However, it was sometimes difficult to choose or navigate channels. We discuss perceived impacts of channels on relationships (e.g., topic-switching during conflicts), and outline design opportunities for messaging apps. ",

With interest in developing MST technologies continuing to grow, it is important to create standardized methods for measuring the effect of these novel systems. We designed and validated a 9-item questionnaire to measure the \"Social Disfordance\" of Mediated Social Touch, with three scales that focus on Social Discomfort, Communicational Expressiveness, and Need for Additional Consideration. A high degree of \"social disfordance\" of an MST system signifies that it may not provide the appropriate social affordances for mediating touch in a particular context. The development of the Social Disfordance of Mediated Social Touch (SDMST) instrument included a systematic literature review, expert feedback, and think-out-loud piloting. Its refinement included an exploratory factor analysis with a subsequent reduction of questions and scales. We report its psychometric properties, including metrics of inter-item reliability, convergent validity, test-retest reliability, and concurrent validity, confirming that these properties are sufficient for future use. We conclude with examples of scoring, appropriate use, and a discussion of the limitations.",

To explore this question, we designed and implemented Message Builder, a text-based communication system that encourages relational partners to send increasingly long messages. We report findings from a field trial in which 14 dyads used Message Builder for everyday relational maintenance. While some of the effort-provoking features of Message Builder were described as problematic, we found that the system had value in guiding users towards authentic and meaningful effort investments that were valuable within their individual relationships.",

The app was intended to provide timely loan information for the drivers and support the collaborative work of loan collection and payment.  We report on the initial experiences with the app, exploring both its intended and its unintended consequences. We do this by comparing the workflows before and after introduction of the app through the lens of the three phases of moneywork: that is, what changed during pre-, at-, and post-transaction moments. Whilst the app certainly streamlined the workflows, unintended consequences arose from making previously hidden work visible, as well the shifting of control towards the back office, reducing field agents’ flexibility.",

      "abstract": "Online advertisements that masquerade as non-advertising content pose numerous risks to users. Such hidden advertisements appear on social media platforms when content creators or \"influencers\" endorse products and brands in their content. While the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires content creators to disclose their endorsements in order to prevent deception and harm to users, we do not know whether and how content creators comply with the FTC's guidelines. In this paper, we studied disclosures within affiliate marketing, an endorsement-based advertising strategy used by social media content creators. We examined whether content creators follow the FTC's disclosure guidelines, how they word the disclosures, and whether these disclosures help users identify affiliate marketing content as advertisements. To do so, we first measured the prevalence of and identified the types of disclosures in over 500,000 YouTube videos and 2.1 million Pinterest pins. We then conducted a user study with 1,791 participants to test the efficacy of these disclosures. Our findings reveal that only about 10% of affiliate marketing content on both platforms contains any disclosures at all. Further, users fail to understand shorter, non-explanatory disclosures. Based on our findings, we make various design and policy suggestions to help improve advertising disclosure practices on social media platforms.",

However, the interactions among victims of IPV, abusers, law enforcement, counselors, and others --- and the roles that digital technologies play in these interactions --- are poorly understood. We present a qualitative study that analyzes the role of digital technologies in the IPV ecosystem in New York City. Findings from semi-structured interviews with 40 IPV professionals and nine focus groups with 32 survivors of IPV reveal a complex set of socio-technical challenges that stem from the intimate nature of the relationships involved and the complexities of managing shared social circles. Both IPV professionals and survivors feel that they do not possess adequate expertise to be able to identify or cope with technology-enabled IPV, and there are currently insufficient best practices to help them deal with abuse via technology. We also reveal a number of tensions and trade-offs in negotiating technology's role in social support and legal procedures. Taken together, our findings contribute a nuanced understanding of technology's role in the IPV ecosystem and yield recommendations for HCI and technology experts interested in aiding victims of abuse.",

      "abstract": "Social media, and people’s online self-presentations and social networks, add complexity to people’s experiences managing changing identities during life transitions. I use gender transition as a case study to understand how people experience liminality on social media. I qualitatively analyzed data from transition blogs on Tumblr (n=240), a social media blogging site on which people document their gender transitions, and in-depth interviews with transgender bloggers (n=20). I apply ethnographer van Gennep’s liminality framework to a social media context and contribute a new understanding of liminality by arguing that reconstructing one’s online identity during life transitions is a rite of passage. During life transitions, people present multiple identities simultaneously on different social media sites that together comprise what I call social transition machinery. Social transition machinery describes the ways that, for people facing life transitions, multiple social media sites and networks o\"en remain separate, yet work together to facilitate life transitions.",

However, the quality of the information available, as well as the motivations of its posters, has been questioned. This work examines the individuals on social media that are posting questionable health-related information, and in particular promoting cancer treatments which have been shown to be ineffective (making it a kind of misinformation, willful or not). Using a multi-stage user selection process, we study 4,212 Twitter users who have posted about one of 139 such \"treatments\", and compare them to a baseline of users generally interested in cancer. Considering features capturing user attributes, writing style, and sentiment, we build a classifier which is able to identify users prone to propagate such misinformation at an accuracy of over 90%, providing a potential tool for public health officials to identify such individuals for preventive intervention.",

      "title": "Designing for Collaborative Infrastructuring: Supporting Resonance Activities",
      "trackId": 10042,
      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "‘Infrastructuring’ as a concept draws attention to the way in which a designed artefact or system is not the end of the development process. Rather, technology development takes place up to, and including, its successful establishment in an associated body of practices. This places emphasis upon the role of practitioners as designers of their own practice environments. While the activities of professional technology development have been reasonably well discussed and conceptualized, activities that practitioners perform to make things work for them are less acknowledged as a systematic contribution to the successful establishment of the use of IT. This paper considers in particular the so-called ‘point of infrastructuring’: the moment at which practitioners become aware of opportunities to (re-)design their infrastructures, usually initiated by breakdowns or the recognition of potential innovations and reconsideration of current infrastructural use. From this point onwards, end users themselves may start configuring, tailoring or developing new conventions until a point has been reached in which a new technology usage has been successfully established. However, points of infrastructuring do not only provoke end-user driven in-situ design (or ‘infrastructuring’) activities. They also evoke so-called ‘resonance activities’. These encompass all of the observations and communications that attend upon a point of infrastructure as it becomes visible within a work environment. Examination of resonance activities can be a starting point for a better understanding of the practitioner’s activities beyond single infrastructural changes, providing a way of highlighting the relationship between different points of infrastructuring. How to capture and understand resonance activities and how to design technological support for them is still an open question. Based on previous work outlined in the literature and an empirical study that looked at collaborative appropriation activities (the most important aspect of infrastructuring) during 3D printing processes, we outline the concept of sociable technologies as a technological approach for capturing and supporting resonance activities and thus enabling infrastructuring activities more broadly.",

      "abstract": "mHealth applications (\"apps\") must be searched for and downloaded prior to use, creating a potential barrier to uptake. Integrating health interventions into existing online social environments removes this barrier. However, little is known about the effects of linking sensitive health information to existing online identities. Our qualitative analysis of online comments (n=192) explores the user views of an HIV intervention integrated into the geosocial hookup app Grindr. We find some HIV positive users report keeping their status private to reduce their stigma exposure, whilst others report publicly disclosing their status to avoid being stigmatised by others. Where users keep their status private, we find concerns that social assumptions may develop around these non-disclosures, creating a privacy unraveling effect which restricts disclosure choice. Using Peppet's four proposed limits to privacy unraveling, we develop a set of descriptive conceptual designs to explore the privacy respecting potential of these limits within this context and propose further research to address this privacy challenge.",

In this paper, we explore how quantification mediates virtual teamwork through an ethnographic study of quantification in League of Legends, a popular team-based online game with a highly competitive culture. In the game, rich statistics about each individual player’s gaming history and performance are publicly available, analyzed and displayed on numerous third-party sites. We describe how players were entangled with numbers. They derived knowledge from numbers but struggled with proper ways of interpretation. They utilized numbers to quantify teammates and opponents, but in-game tensions and conflicts easily ensued. They noticed how quantification became burdensome and stressed the importance of proper use. We discuss how this case of quantified self and others manifests complex relationships between self-knowledge, numerical authority, and virtual teamwork.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine co-located collaboration in larger groups (of 8-12 users) seated around a large-scale high-resolution multi-touch horizontal display. Our findings shed light on: 1) the effect of collaboration patterns of larger groups on equity of participation; 2) the role of participants’ position around the tabletop in forming collaborations; and 3) the mechanisms, which facilitate coordination and collaboration in larger group interacting around large-scale tabletops; We also contribute computational methods that leverage image processing to analyze interaction around large-scale tabletops. Finally, we discuss implications for the design of large-scale tabletop systems for supporting co-located collaboration in larger groups.",

      "abstract": "If scientific research can be described as ``arm's length'' cooperative work, then the sciences engaged in the creation and maintenance of cooperatively built classification systems might be said to require extremely long arms; workers must reach across great distances of time, space and awareness to independently contribute to the creation and maintenance of a conceptual infrastructure. This is particularly the case for the field of biological taxonomy, in which researchers across the globe have, for more than three hundred years, cooperatively developed a massive knowledge organization system describing all life on earth. As taxonomists move from paper-based workflows to born-digital, data-first modes of publishing, new tools and approaches are needed to support their work. In this paper, we present research conducted as part of the \"Transforming Taxonomic Interfaces\" project aimed at improving interfaces for taxonomic software. We describe biological taxonomy in the context of CSCW, and identify key strategies taxonomists deploy to facilitate loosely coupled cooperative work. We also contribute a discussion of \\textit{semantic refactoring}, a unique kind of ``articulation work'' entailed in developing, maintaining, and migrating classification systems. This work has implications for the design and study of knowledge organization systems and infrastructure, classification research, and for the development of general semantic web tools and software as well as those specifically for biological taxonomy.",

      "abstract": "Many systems have been designed to study social aspects in physical activity tracking. In most, social functions are performed at a distance, such as posting comments and achievements, or via in-app leaderboards. We present an activity tracking app designed instead to encourage face-to-face encounters. Stickers for Steps seeks to recreate the experience of a physical sticker book, where digital ‘stickers’ are collected in an album, but where stickers are awarded for reaching activity targets. Users will accrue duplicate stickers, which can be swapped with other co-located users over a Bluetooth connection. We explore the usage of our app, reporting on a trial with 33 participants. We find that our app successfully encouraged groups of users to swap duplicates, review progress and to discuss their levels of activity. We provide design recommendations for future activity tracking systems that could incorporate face-to-face interactions.",

      "abstract": "Smart home Internet of Things (IoT) devices are rapidly increasing in popularity, with more households including Internet-connected devices that continuously monitor user activities. In this study, we conduct eleven semi-structured interviews with smart home owners, investigating their reasons for purchasing IoT devices, perceptions of smart home privacy risks, and actions taken to protect their privacy from those external to the home who create, manage, track, or regulate IoT devices and/or their data. We note several recurring themes. First, users' desires for convenience and connectedness dictate their privacy-related behaviors for dealing with external entities, such as device manufacturers, Internet Service Providers, governments, and advertisers. Second, user opinions about external entities collecting smart home data depend on perceived benefit from these entities. Third, users trust IoT device manufacturers to protect their privacy but do not verify that these protections are in place. Fourth, users are unaware of privacy risks from inference algorithms operating on data from non-audio/visual devices. These findings motivate several recommendations for device designers, researchers, and industry standards to better match device privacy features to the expectations and preferences of smart home owners.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "One way to improve the productivity of knowledge workers is to increase their self-awareness about productivity at work through self-monitoring. Yet, little is known about expectations of, the experience with, and the impact of self-monitoring in the workplace. To address this gap, we studied software developers, as one community of knowledge workers. We used an iterative, user-feedback-driven development approach (N=20) and a survey (N=413) to infer design elements for workplace self-monitoring, which we then implemented as a technology probe called WorkAnalytics. We field-tested these design elements during a three-week study with software development professionals (N=43). Based on the results of the field study, we present design recommendations for self-monitoring in the workplace, such as using experience sampling to increase the awareness about work and to create richer insights, the need for a large variety of different metrics to retrospect about work, and that actionable insights, enriched with benchmarking data from co-workers, are likely needed to foster productive behavior change and improve collaboration at work. Our work can serve as a starting point for researchers and practitioners to build self-monitoring tools for the workplace.",

      "abstract": "Automatic Gender Recognition (AGR) is a subfield of facial recognition that aims to algorithmically identify the gender of individuals from photographs or videos. In wider society the technology has proposed applications in physical access control, data analytics and advertising. Within academia, it is already used in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to analyse social media usage. Given the long-running critiques of HCI for failing to consider and include transgender (trans) perspectives in research, and the potential implications of AGR for trans people if deployed, I sought to understand how AGR and HCI understand the term \"gender\", and how HCI describes and deploys gender recognition technology. Using a content analysis of papers from both fields, I show that AGR consistently operationalises gender in a trans-exclusive way, and consequently carries disproportionate risk for trans people subject to it. In addition, I use the dearth of discussion of this in HCI papers that apply AGR to discuss how HCI operationalises gender, and the implications that this has for the field's research. I conclude with recommendations for alternatives to AGR, and some ideas for how HCI can work towards a more effective and trans-inclusive treatment of gender.",

      "abstract": "Children under age 12 increasingly use Internet-connected devices to go online. And while Internet use exposes people to privacy and security risks, few studies examine how these children perceive and address such concerns. To fill this gap, we conducted a qualitative study of 18 U.S. families with children ages 5-11. We found that children recognized certain privacy and security components from the contextual integrity framework, but children ages 5-7 had gaps in their knowledge. Children developed some strategies to manage concerns but largely relied on parents for support. Parents primarily used passive strategies to mediate children’s device use and largely deferred teaching children about these concerns to the future. We argue that helping children develop strong privacy and security practices at a young age will prepare them to manage their privacy and security as adolescents and adults. We offer recommendations to scaffold children’s learning on privacy and security.",

      "abstract": "In response to a perceived caregiver shortage and need to support aging in place, telehealth home care systems are being developed to provide remote care and monitoring to older people. Though research has examined the experiences of teleoperators delivering care through these systems, we know less about the experiences of older adults receiving this care. We report findings from a three-month study of a tablet-based telehealth home care system that provides support for aging in place. We find that there is a mismatch between the designer’s conception of how care should be delivered and the ways that participants were interested in using the system. This mismatch exists in four areas: participants’ interest in getting to know the human teleoperators and rejecting the virtual avatar, interrogating the interface to figure out the inner workings of the platform, pushing for a more symmetrical relationship, and negotiating the relation work that they were willing to perform in the “sacred space” of their homes. We draw on the concept of heteromation to understand the political dimensions of telehealth aging in place technologies. We also provide implications and future directions for technologies requiring relation work as well as the design of avatar-based remote companionship.",

In this paper, we describe a long-standing set of inefficiencies that have plagued new page patrolling by drawing a contrast to the more efficient, distributed processes for counter-vandalism. To effect better page review distribution, we develop an effective automated topic model based on a labeling strategy that leverages a folksonomy developed by subject specific working groups in Wikipedia (WikiProject tags) and a flexible ontology (WikiProjects Directory) to arrive at a hierarchical and uniform label set.  We are able to attain very high fitness measures (macro ROC-AUC: 95.2%, macro PR-AUC: 74.5%) and real-time performance using word2vec-based features on the intial draft versions of articles. Finally, we present a proposal for how incorporating this model into current tools will shift the dynamics of new article review positively.",

      "abstract": "Ride-hailing services have received attention as part of the growing work around the sharing economy, but the focus of these studies has largely been on drivers. In this paper, we examine how ride-hailing is transforming the transportation practices of one group of passengers - people with visual impairments in metropolitan India. Through a qualitative study consisting of interviews and observations, we examined the use and impact of these services on our target population, who otherwise contend with chaotic, unreliable, and largely inaccessible modes of transportation. We found that ride-hailing services positively affects participants' notions of independence, and we tease out how independence for our participants is not just about 'doing things alone, without help' but is also situated, social and relative. Furthermore, we show how accessibility, in the case of ride-hailing in India, is a socio-technical and collaborative achievement, involving interactions between the passenger, the driver, and the technology.",

      "abstract": "We report on an initial ethnographic exploration of the situation of sex-trafficking survivors in Nepal. In the course of studying trafficking survivors in a protected-living situation created by a non-governmental organization in Nepal, we adapted photo-elicitation to hear the voices of the survivors by making the technique more communal.  Bringing sociality to the forefront of the method reduced the pressure on survivors to assert voices as individuals, allowing them to speak. We make three contributions to research. First, we propose a communal form of photo-elicitation as a method to elicit values in sensitive settings. Second, we present the complex circumstances of the survivors as they undergo rehabilitation and move towards life with a \"new normal\". Third, our work adds to HCI and CSCW literature on understanding specific concerns of trafficking survivors and aims to inform designs that can support reintegration of survivors in society. The values that the survivors hold and their notion of future opportunities suggest possession of limited but important social capital in some domains that could be leveraged to aid reintegration.",

      "abstract": "From statistics and mapping to engineering and medicine, technology has long been a tool of governance, shaping how nation states control their own and other regions' populations and natural resources. More recently, a nation's capacity to cultivate citizens as tech innovators and entrepreneurs is considered an indicator of its economic prosperity and global power. We show how this turn towards innovation and entrepreneurship is central to how technological and political elites tinker with new modes of governance and define the relationship between the future of the nation and its citizenry in economic terms. Drawing from long-term multi-sited ethnographic research in the United States, China, and Africa, we present a subset of findings to show how these shifts in governance are being enacted through interconnections between politicians and technologists, and the products, spaces, and educational ideals they fund and create. We argue that making sense of these shifts in governance is essential for current and future CSCW scholarship as they intersect with issues of power within social computing.",

      "abstract": "From Fortune 500 companies to local communities, organizations often strive to build a shared understanding about complex problems. Design competitions provide a compelling approach to create incentives and infrastructure for gathering insights about a problem-space. In this paper, we present an analysis of a two-month civic design competition focused on transportation challenges in a major US city. We examine how the event structure, discussion platform, and participant interactions affected how a community collectively discussed design constraints and proposals. Ninety-two participants took part in the competition's online discussion, hosted on Slack. Applying a mixed-methods analysis, we found that participants shared less as they settled into teams and, due to the discussion system, had difficulty seeing how topics connected across channels; we also learned that certain messages led participants to add depth to existing topics. Based on the findings we provide recommendations for civic competitions aimed at building knowledge around a problem.",

Information and communication technologies (ICT) have the potential to support collaboration and cooperation between people with dementia and their caregivers and to promote the independence, wellbeing and quality of life of all parties involved. In this context, we investigated the potential for an ICT-based videogame system to generate and facilitate social experiences for people with dementia and their caregivers. 26 people with dementia and their caregivers participated in a 16-month participatory design case study. The results suggest that collaboration and cooperation amongst the parties involved was increased by using the system. The study also revealed both positive and negative social experiences triggered by the videogame-based system. This article will report on these results and consider their implications for the future design of similar systems and their potential to further encourage collaboration and cooperation amongst people with dementia and their caregivers.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we examine how activist organizations, focused on human rights violations (HRVs) in Mexico, obtain and translate data to produce actionable insight for social change. Through interviews with 15 participants working in think tanks, human rights centers, non-governmental organizations, and nonprofit organizations, we identified two key data challenges that impact their work: absent and conflicting data. We then describe how these nonprofits try to understand these issues by building alliances to address specific, detrimental knowledge and data gaps. Next, we articulate how these activists use data to work towards social change by informing citizens, requesting action, and building capacity. Lastly, we propose recommendations on how to design for HRVs-focused data practices, focusing on issues related to addressing technology and infrastructure constraints, designing for safety, and supporting community data collection and dissemination.",

Patients’ values for health and well-being influence their healthcare priorities, but recent work suggests that the values discussed in clinical settings do not reflect the full breadth of patients’ values. To address an evidence gap regarding how discussions about values occur in clinical settings, we conducted a field study with patients with multiple chronic conditions and their health care providers, including clinical observations, interviews, and home visits. We report on the extent to which certain categories of patients’ values identified in prior research were discussed in clinic visits. We then discuss how patients and providers coordinated their perspectives to establish connections among patients’ values and health concerns. These findings have implications for the design of systems to support patient-provider communication to incorporate patients’ values and promote concordant priorities for health care.",

At the same time, they can be abused to engage in cyberbullying, which can cause significant psychological harm to those affected. Thus, with the growth in multimodal communication platforms, there is an urgent need to devise multimodal methods for cyberbullying detection and prevention. However, there are no existing approaches that use automated audio and video analysis to complement textual analysis. Based on the analysis of a human-labeled cyberbullying data-set of Vine \"media sessions\" (six-second videos, with audio, and corresponding text comments), we report that: 1) multiple audio and visual features are significantly associated with the occurrence of cyberbullying, and 2) audio and video features complement textual features for more accurate and earlier cyberbullying detection. These results pave the way for more effective cyberbullying detection in emerging multimodal (audio, visual, virtual reality) social interaction spaces.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Popularity systems, like Twitter retweets, Reddit upvotes, and Pinterest pins  have the potential to guide people toward posts that others liked. That, however, creates a feedback loop that reduces their informativeness: items marked as more popular get more attention, so that additional upvotes and retweets may simply reflect the increased attention and not independent information about the fraction of people that like the items. How much information remains? For example, how confident can we be that more people prefer item A to item B if item A had hundreds of upvotes on Reddit and item B had only a few? We investigate using an Internet game called GuessTheKarma that collects independent preference judgments (N=20,674) for 400 pairs of images, approximately 50 per pair. Unlike the rating systems that dominate social media services, GuessTheKarma is devoid of social and ranking effects that influence ratings. Overall, Reddit scores were not very good predictors of the true population preferences for items as measured by GuessTheKarma: the image with higher score was preferred by a majority of independent raters only 68\\% of the time. However, when one image had a low score and the other was one of the highest scoring in its subreddit, the higher scoring image was preferred nearly 90% of the time by the majority of independent raters. Similarly, Imgur view counts for the images were poor predictors except when there were orders of magnitude differences between the pairs. We conclude that popularity systems marked by feedback loops may convey a strong signal about population preferences, but only when comparing items that received vastly different popularity scores.",

Despite its importance, ambiance has been crucially overlooked by urban planners and scientists alike, not least because it is difficult to record and analyze at scale. We explored the possibility of using social media data to reliably map the ambiance of neighborhoods in the entire city of London. To this end, we collected geo-referenced picture tags from Flickr and matched those tags with the words in a newly created ambiance dictionary. In so doing, we made four main contributions: i) map the ambiance of London neighborhoods; ii) ascertain that such a mapping meets residents' expectations, which are derived from a survey we conducted; iii) show that computer vision techniques upon  geo-referenced pictures are of  predictive power for neighborhood ambiance; and iv) explain each prediction of a neighborhood's ambiance by identifying the picture that best reflects the meaning of that ambiance (e.g., artsy) in that neighborhood (e.g., South Kensington---the richest and most traditional neighborhood---and  Shoreditch---among the most progressive and hipster neighborhoods in the city---are both `artsy' but in very different ways). The combination of the predictive power of mapping ambiance from images and the ability to explain those predictions makes it possible to discover hidden gems across the city at an unprecedented scale.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Online harassment is a pervasive and pernicious problem. Techniques like natural language processing and machine learning are promising approaches for identifying abusive language, but they fail to address structural power imbalances perpetuated by automated labeling and classification. Similarly, platform policies and reporting tools are designed for a seemingly homogenous user base and do not account for individual experiences and systems of social oppression. This paper describes the design and evaluation of HeartMob, a platform built by and for people who are disproportionately affected by the most severe forms of online harassment. We conducted interviews with 18 HeartMob users, both targets and supporters, about their harassment experiences and their use of the site. We examine systems of classification enacted by technical systems, platform policies, and users to demonstrate how 1) labeling serves to validate (or invalidate) harassment experiences; 2) labeling motivates bystanders to provide support; and 3) labeling content as harassment is critical for surfacing community norms around appropriate user behavior. We discuss these results through the lens of Bowker and Star’s classification theories and describe implications for labeling and classifying online abuse. Finally, informed by intersectional feminist theory, we argue that fully addressing online harassment requires the ongoing integration of vulnerable users’ needs into the design and moderation of online platforms.",

      "title": "Constructing Urban Tourism Space Digitally: A Study of Airbnb Listings in Two Berlin Neighborhoods",
      "trackId": 10042,
      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Over the past decade, Airbnb has emerged as the most popular platform for renting out single rooms or whole apartments. The impact of Airbnb listings on local neighborhoods has been controversially discussed in many cities around the world. The platform's widespread adoption led to changes in urban life, and in particular urban tourism. In this paper, we argue that urban tourism space can no longer be understood as a fixed, spatial entity. Instead, we follow a constructionist approach and argue that urban tourism space is (re-)produced digitally and collaboratively on online platforms such as Airbnb. We relate our work to a research direction in the CSCW community that is concerned with the role of digital technologies in the production and appropriation of urban space and use the concept of representations as a theoretical lens for our empirical study. In that study, we qualitatively analyzed how the two Berlin neighborhoods Kreuzkölln and City West are digitally constructed by Airbnb hosts in their listing descriptions. Moreover, we quantitatively investigated to what extend mentioned places differ between Airbnb hosts and visitBerlin, the city's destination management organization (DMO). In our qualitative analysis, we found that hosts primarily focus on facilities and places in close proximity to their apartment. In the traditional urban tourism hotspot City West, hosts referred to many places also mentioned by the DMO. In the neighborhood of Kreuzkölln, in contrast, hosts reframed everyday places such as parks or an immigrant food market as the must sees in the area. We discuss how Airbnb hosts contribute to the discursive production of urban neighborhoods and thus co-produce them as tourist destinations. With the emergence of online platforms such as Airbnb, power relations in the construction of tourism space might shift from DMOs towards local residents who are now producing tourism space collaboratively.",

      "abstract": "The web affords connections by which end-users can receive paid, expert help—such as programming, design,and writing—to reach their goals. While a number of online marketplaces have emerged to facilitate suchconnections, most end-users do not approach a market to hire an expert when faced with a challenge. To reduce friction in hiring from peer-to-peer expert crowd work markets, we propose Ink, a system that crowd workers can use to showcase their services by embedding tasks inside web tutorials—a common destination for users with information needs. Workers have agency to define and manage tasks, through which users can request their help to review or execute each step of the tutorial, for example, to give feedback on a paper outline, perform a statistical analysis, or host a practice programming interview. In a public deployment,over 25,000 pageviews led 168 tutorial readers to pay crowd workers for their services, most of whom had not previously hired from crowdsourcing marketplaces. A field experiment showed that users were more likely to hire crowd experts when the task was embedded inside the tutorial rather than when they were redirected to the same worker’s Upwork profile to hire them. Qualitative analysis of interviews showed that Ink framed hiring expert crowd workers within users’ well-established information seeking habits and gave workers more control over their work.",

      "abstract": "Although “privacy by design” (PBD)—embedding privacy protections into products during design, rather than retroactively—uses the term “design” to recognize how technical design choices implement and settle policy, design approaches and methodologies are largely absent from PBD conversations. Critical, speculative, and value-centered design approaches can be used to elicit reflections on relevant social values early in product development, and are a natural fit for PBD and necessary to achieve PBD’s goal. Bringing these together, we present a case study using a design workbook of speculative design fictions as a values elicitation tool. Originally used as a reflective tool among a research group, we transformed the workbook into artifacts to share as values elicitation tools in interviews with graduate students training as future technology professionals. We discuss how these design artifacts surface contextual, socially-oriented understandings of privacy, and their potential utility in relationship to other values levers.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Personal informatics systems for supporting health largely grew out of a \"self\"-centric orientation: self-tracking, self-reflection, self-knowledge, self-experimentation, self-improvement. Health management, however, even when self-driven, is inherently social and depends on a person’s direct relationships and broader sociocultural contexts, as an emerging line of research is coming to recognize, study, and support. This is particularly true in the case of mental health. In this paper, we engage with individuals managing the serious mental illness bipolar disorder and members of their support circles to (a) identify key social relations and the roles they play in condition management, (b) characterize patients' complex interactions with these relations (e.g., positive or negative, direct or peripheral, steady or unstable), and (c) understand how personal informatics mediates these recovery relations. Based on these insights, we offer a model of this social ecology, along with design implications for personal informatics systems that are sensitive to these interpersonal contexts.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates how a teleoperated surgical robot reconfigures teamwork in the operating room by spatially redistributing team members. We report on findings from two years of fieldwork at two hospitals, including interviews and video data. We find that while in non-robotic cases team members huddle together, physically touching, introduction of a surgical robot increases physical and sensory distance between team members. This spatial rearrangement has implications for both cognitive and affective dimensions of collaborative surgical work. Cognitive distance is increased, necessitating new efforts to maintain situation awareness and common ground. Moreover, affective distance is introduced, decreasing sensitivity to shared and non-shared affective states and leading to new practices aimed at restoring affective connection within the team. We describe new forms of physical, cognitive, and affective distance associated with teleoperated robotic surgery, and the effects these have on power distribution, practice, and collaborative experience within the surgical team.",

      "abstract": "To ensure the post quality, Q&A sites usually develop a list of quality assurance guidelines for \"dos and don'ts\", and adopt the collaborative editing mechanism to fix violations of community norms. Guidelines are mostly high-level principles, and many tacit and context-sensitive aspects of the expected community norms cannot be easily enforced by a set of explicit rules. Collaborative editing is a reactive mechanism after low-quality posts have been posted. Our study of collaborative editing data on Stack Overflow suggests that tacit and context-sensitive norm-meeting knowledge is manifested in the editing patterns of large numbers of collaborative edits. Inspired by this observation, we develop and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network based approach to learn mid-level editing patterns from historical post edits for predicting the need of editing a post. Our approach provides a proactive policy assurance mechanism that warns users potential issues in a post before it is posted.",

      "abstract": "As digital fabrication technology has become mainstream, the increased demand for 3D printed objects has created a new market for professional outsourcing. Given that most of this work does not require advanced training, and is an appropriate entry-level manufacturing job, there is an exciting opportunity to employ youth already skilled in \"making\" and interested in technology to do this work as an after-school job. The combination of this new technology and workforce calls for new workflows that streamline client-driven digital manufacturing. However, the limitations of current digital fabrication technology and youth schedules require that this work be spread between multiple shifts, necessitating employees to coordinate and handoff their work. We investigated the collaborative practices between youth employees while working on client jobs in a 3D print shop during one year of field work. In this paper, we describe instances where youth employees successfully, and unsuccessfully, handed off work between shifts and identify techniques utilized by youth to support successful handoffs, including: counting physical artifacts, using asynchronous chat programs, and documenting work. We then discuss the impact of the print shop manager's presence, physical characteristics of 3D prints, and youth perspectives of work on the selection of and effectiveness of these techniques. Finally, we offer lessons learned from successful handoffs in the print shop and recommendations for supporting youth in collaborative work environments.",

Despite the increasing interest in EBSNs, little research has paid attention to the privacy issues coming from the unique features of EBSNs; the on-site information of users is highly relevant to real lives. In this paper, we try to investigate privacy leakages in EBSNs, by examining a popular EBSN service Meetup. More specifically, we tried to answer what private information can be mined from the site’s publicly available data. To this end, we have conducted a measurement study by crawling webpages from Meetup containing 240K groups, 8.9M users, 27M group affiliations and 78M topical interests. By analyzing the dataset, we  find that LGBT status of users, which is one of the most sensitive privacy information, can be predicted with 93% accuracy. Finally we discuss the cause of the privacy leakage on EBSNs and its possible ensuing damages.",

While gamification itself is receiving a large amount of attention, there has been little beyond individual studies to assess its suitability or success for citizen science; similarly, while frameworks exist for assessing citizen science performance, they tend to lack any appreciation of the effects that game elements might have had. We therefore review the literature to determine what the trends are regarding the performance of particular game elements or characteristics in citizen science, and survey existing projects to assess how popular different game features are. Investigating this phenomenon further, we then present the results of a series of interviews carried out with the EyeWire citizen science project team to understand more about how gamification elements are introduced, monitored, and assessed in a live project. Our findings suggest that projects use a range of game elements with points and leaderboards the most popular, particularly in projects that describe themselves as “games.” Currently, gamification appears to be effective in citizen science for maintaining engagement with existing communities, but shows limited impact for attracting new players.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge-sharing live streams are distinct from traditional educational videos, in part due to the large concurrently-viewing audience and the real-time discussions that are possible between viewers and the streamer. Though this medium creates unique opportunities for interactive learning, it also brings about the challenge of creating a useful archive for post-hoc learning. This paper presents the results of interviews with knowledge sharing streamers, their moderators, and viewers to understand current experiences and needs for sharing and learning knowledge through live streaming. Based on those findings, we built StreamWiki, a tool which leverages the availability of live stream viewers to produce useful archives of the interactive learning experience. On StreamWiki, moderators initiate high-level tasks that viewers complete by conducting microtasks, such as writing summaries, sending comments, and voting for informative comments. As a result, a summary document is built in real time. Through the tests of our prototype with streamers and viewers, we found that StreamWiki could help viewers understand the content and the context of the stream, during the stream and also later, for post-hoc learning.",

      "abstract": "Engagements with social media today frequently involve the use of multiple platforms, which often exchange personal data about users. We explore individuals’ experiences with the flow of personal data across platforms through interviews about dating apps, often requiring integration with a Facebook account. Inductive analysis revealed complex and, at times, conflicted ideas over what appropriate behaviors around personal data should look like in multiplatform engagements—central to these tensions were the multiple relationships that must be managed through participation in these ecosystems. For example, individuals talked of resignation in relation to specific platforms and the “cost” of using free services (people:platform), a lack of clarity and agency in defining what personal data might be shared between platforms (people:platform:platform), and, of course, the role of personal data in their efforts to establish and maintain relationships with other users in these “social discovery” ecosystems (people:people). We explore how these attitudes can be understood as morally charged, drawing attention to the ways in which personal data flows can enact expectations and obligations between various sociotechnical actors in personal data ecosystems and how these compound relationships reveal the complexity and texture of multiplatform participation.",

Existing work has examined the potentials and weaknesses of its use during specific events. Fewer studies, however, have focused on citizens’ perceptions of social media in emergencies, and none have deployed a representative sample to examine this. We present the results of the first representative study on citizens’ perception of social media in emergencies that we have conducted in Germany. Our study highlights, for example, that around half (45%) of people have used social media during an emergency to share and / or look for information. In contrast, false rumours on social media (74%) are perceived as a threat. Moreover, only a minority of people have downloaded a smartphone app for emergencies (15.5%), with the most popular ones’ weather and first aid apps.",

These news articles are often posted on social media and attract user engagement in the form of comments. In this paper, we investigate linguistic (especially emotional and topical) signals expressed in user comments in the presence of misinformation and fact-checking. We collect and analyze a dataset of 5,303 social media posts with 2,614,374 user comments from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, and associate these posts to fact-check articles from Snopes and PolitiFact for veracity rulings (i.e., from true to false). We find that linguistic signals in user comments vary significantly with the veracity of posts, e.g., we observe more misinformation-awareness signals and extensive emoji and swear word usage with falser posts. We further show that these signals can help to detect misinformation. In addition, we find that while there are signals indicating positive effects after fact-checking, there are also signals indicating potential \"backfire\" effects.",

We study the crowdsourcing of large networks where the crowd provides the network topology via microtasks. Crowds can explore many types of social and information networks, but we focus on the network of causal attributions, an important network that signifies cause-and-effect relationships. We conduct experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) testing how workers propose and validate individual causal relationships and introduce a method for independent crowd workers to explore large networks. The core of the method, Iterative Pathway Refinement, is a theoretically-principled mechanism for efficient exploration via microtasks. We evaluate the method using synthetic networks and apply it on AMT to extract a large-scale causal attribution network, then investigate the structure of this network as well as the activity patterns and efficiency of the workers who constructed this network. Worker interactions reveal important characteristics of causal perception and the network data they generate can improve our understanding of causality and causal inference.",

In this paper, we compare different information sharing techniques and determine an efficient technique for the collaboration between workers. In our user experiment, participants performed a floor plan design task in a designer and engineer pairing on a desktop VR environment. The results showed that the proposed information sharing technique, in which objects are updated based on local users' actions, is more suitable than real-time updates. In addition, we discuss design implications that can be applied to different collaborative scenarios.",

As part of the growing technological support for such collaboration, an opportunity exists to design systems that actively guide and facilitate collaborative problem solving toward the most productive outcomes. A better understanding of the dynamics of open-ended collaboration on complex problems is needed to realize this opportunity. Motivated by this need for better understanding, we investigate the collaborative problem solving ecosystem of the scientific-discovery game Foldit. Our investigation is guided by two primary questions: how do the social aspects of Foldit impact an individual's behavior? and what factors have significant impact on group success? We find that collaboration and competition are associated with increased participation and that collaboration increases individual performance. We also find that measures of group skill, individual skill, and participation correlate with better group performance.",

The current study examines the effects of culture on affective grounding. We conducted a laboratory experiment in which pairs of participants, half from America (A) and half from China (C), collaborated over instant messaging (IM).

      "abstract": "Online experiments allow researchers to collect data from large, demographically diverse global populations. Unlike in-lab studies, however, online experiments often fail to inform participants about the research to which they contribute. This paper is the first to investigate barriers that prevent researchers from providing such science communication in online experiments. We found that the main obstacles preventing researchers from including such information are assumptions about participant disinterest, limited time, concerns about losing anonymity, and concerns about experimental bias. Researchers also noted the dearth of tools to help them close the information loop with their study participants. Based on these findings, we formulated design requirements and implemented Digestif, a new web-based tool that supports researchers in providing their participants with science communication pages. Our evaluation shows that Digestif's scaffolding, examples, and nudges to focus on participants make researchers more aware of their participants' curiosity about research and more likely to disclose pertinent research information.",

      "abstract": "Decreasing our demand for energy is an important component of the global effort to reduce carbon emissions. Energy consumption, both at home and in the workplace, is greatly influenced by human behaviour. Our research investigates how technological interventions could support behaviour-based energy reduction. This paper reports a Living Lab study on the co-design of a device for improving energy efficiency via behaviour change in a large public-sector organisation. We emphasise the importance of taking a broad view of organisational behaviour, highlighting the complex and indirect ways that it influences energy use.  Methods and findings are reported from a series of insight and innovation workshops that we held with staff, and which led to the development of a prototype device - LILEE: The Little Interface for Lab Equipment Efficiency. We describe LILEE and discuss how it embodies wider lessons for the design of effective energy-related behaviour change interventions.",

      "abstract": "Understanding whether and how motivation affects participation in online experiments is critical because who contributes and how they contribute can affect the validity of findings. Analyzing data from 7,674 participants across three different studies on the volunteer-based online experiment platform LabintheWild, we  identified five motivation types for participating: boredom, comparison, fun, science, and self-learning. We found that these motivation types affect study selection, attention, and dropouts. Participants who were highly motivated by boredom paid less attention and were more likely to dropout than those who were motivated by the possibility of contributing to science. We additionally show that motivation can impact study results and suggest how researchers can take participants' motivation into account when designing and analyzing data from volunteer-based online experiments.",

      "abstract": "Citizen participation in crisis communication increasingly occurs in social media contexts. As some platforms – e.g., social news sites – evolve around collaborative voting, filtering, and information sharing, the aggregation of breaking news information during crisis situations appears more often as an emergent practice in these online communities. Drawing from 53 interviews and descriptive quantitative analysis of reddit posts and comments, this paper presents a qualitative case study examining reddit.com members aggregate information during crisis events within the context of reddit's post/comment structure, crowd voting, and ranking algorithms. Using the lens of network gatekeeping, the paper shows how participants evaluate sources, organize information, and verify details to demonstrate how different affordances and limitations of information production allow or restrict particular types of network gatekeeping.",

      "abstract": "Norms are central to how online communities are governed. Yet, norms are also emergent, arise from interaction, and can vary significantly between communities---making them challenging to study at scale. In this paper, we study community norms on Reddit in a large-scale, empirical manner. Via 2.8M comments removed by moderators of 100 top subreddits over 10 months, we use both computational and qualitative methods to identify three types of norms: macro norms that are universal to most parts of Reddit; meso norms that are shared across certain groups of subreddits; and micro norms that are specific to individual, relatively unique subreddits. Given the size of Reddit's user base---and the wide range of topics covered by different subreddits---we argue this represents the first large-scale study of norms across disparate online communities. In other words, these findings shed light on what Reddit values, and how widely-held those values are. We conclude by discussing implications for the design of new and existing online communities.",

A new application area of live streaming is in the video game community, where players stream their gameplay. Since most of the streamed games are team-based, one’s live streaming may involve other players’ gameplay and disclosure. In the present paper, we aim to understand the attitudes and strategies of players who have been streamed by others in video game live streaming. From an interview study with 20 World of Warcraft (WoW) players, we found that participants had concerns about being streamed due to different factors, and adopted individual and collaborative strategies to cope with their concerns. We discuss privacy challenges in live streaming and present design implications for live streaming tools to improve privacy management.",

      "abstract": "Research in social computing has typically conceptualized community growth as a process through which a group welcomes newcomers individually. However, online communities also grow through formal and informal mergers, where groups of newcomers with shared experiences join in batches. To understand this process, we conducted a six month, comparative ethnography of two mergers of World of Warcraft raid guilds. While one merger led to a single, thriving community, the other led to the dissolution of both pre-merger groups. Analysis of our ethnographic data suggests that differences in managing organizational culture (a concept drawn from organization studies) led the successful and failed cases to diverge. The study contributes to our understanding of why some attempts to integrate members of different communities are more successful than others. We outline several ways that community leaders, researchers, and designers can effectively take organizational culture into account.",

Using linguistic methods to compare political discourse on far-left, mainstream and alt-right news articles covering the #MeToo movement, we reveal rhetorical similarities and differences in commenting behavior across the political spectrum. We employed natural language processing techniques and qualitative methods on a corpus of approximately 30,000 Facebook comments from three politically distinct news publishers. Our findings show that commenting behavior reflects how social movements are framed and understood within a particular political orientation. Surprisingly, these data reveal that the structural patterns of discourse among commenters from the two alternative news sites are similar in terms of their relationship to those from the mainstream – exhibiting polarization, generalization, and othering of perspectives in political conversation. These data have implications for understanding the possibility for civil discourse in online venues and the role of commenting behavior in polarizing media sources in undermining such discourse.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Many social media systems explicitly connect individuals (e.g., Facebook or Twitter); as a result, they are the targets of most research on social networks. However, many systems do not emphasize or support explicit linking between people (e.g., Wikipedia or Reddit), and even fewer explicitly link communities. Instead, network analysis is performed through inference on implicit connections, such as co-authorship or text similarity. Depending on how inference is done and what data drove it, different networks may emerge. While correlated structures often indicate stability, in this work we demonstrate that differences, or misalignment, between inferred networks also capture interesting behavioral patterns. For example, high-text but low-author similarity often reveals communities \"at war'' with each other over an issue or high-author but low-text similarity can suggest community fragmentation. Because we are able to model edge direction, we also find that asymmetry in degree (in-versus-out) co-occurs with marginalized identities (subreddits related to women, people of color, LGBTQ, etc.). In this work, we provide algorithms that can identify misaligned links, network structures and communities. We then apply these techniques to Reddit to demonstrate how these algorithms can be used to decipher inter-group dynamics in social media.",

Mental health researchers and clinicians do not consistently agree about whether smartphone addiction exists nor what it would look like if it does. Our goal in this study was to explore the patterns of responses that people invoked when talking about the role of smartphones in their lives and the lives of those around them. Responses suggested that both parents and teens are aware of and potentially influenced by a narrative that smartphones are addictive and can lead to negative, though largely undefined, consequences. We examine potential origins of this narrative, including media coverage, and examine the critical need for a deeper examination in the CSCW community of how this narrative could be influencing well-being, sense of self, and sensemaking around smartphone use.",

      "abstract": "Audio annotation is key to developing machine-listening systems; yet, effective ways to accurately and rapidly obtain crowdsourced audio annotations is understudied. In this work, we seek to quantify the reliability/redundancy trade-off in crowdsourced soundscape annotation, investigate how visualizations affect accuracy and efficiency, and characterize how performance varies as a function of audio characteristics. Using a controlled experiment, we varied sound visualizations and the complexity of soundscapes presented to human annotators. Results show that more complex audio scenes result in lower annotator agreement, and spectrogram visualizations are superior in producing higher quality annotations at lower cost of time and human labor. We also found recall is more affected than precision by soundscape complexity, and mistakes can be often attributed to certain sound event characteristics. These findings have implications not only for how we should design annotation tasks and interfaces for audio data, but also how we train and evaluate machine-listening systems.",

      "abstract": "One of the limits of web content discovery tools, let them be recommender systems or content curation tools such as social rating, social bookmarking and other social media, is the scarcity of user input (e.g. rate, submit, share). This problem is even worse in the case of what we call communities of a place: people who study, live or work at the same place. Such people often share common interests but either do not know each other or fail to actively engage in submitting and relaying information. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using the aggregated clicks of entire communities of users to passively emulate a content curation service a la Reddit. To this end, we prototype and deploy WeBrowse, a content curation service based on the processing of raw HTTP logs. Evaluation based on our deployments demonstrates feasibility at scale while respecting user privacy. The majority of WeBrowse's users welcome the quality of content it promotes.",

      "abstract": "Independence is a central concern for people in the care of many chronic conditions. It is often viewed as a goal that can be facilitated with the use of patient data. It is also viewed, especially from the medical side, as something an individual achieves. However, in the lived experience, independence is often a set of collaborative practices. In this paper, we unpack findings from an interview-based study of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) self-care. We found that independence - both functional and in the form of effecting agency - must be co-constructed by the choices and activities of the care network, including the person with disability, caregivers, and clinicians. This collaboratively shaped independence also affects potential collection and use of data in support of self-care. We describe how collaboratively shaped independence informs requirements and constraints for the design of sensor-based networks for self-care in long-term chronic disability.",

      "abstract": "Contemporary code review is a widespread practice used by software engineers to maintain high software quality and share project knowledge. However, conducting proper code review takes time and developers often have limited time for review. In this paper, we aim at investigating the information that reviewers need to conduct a proper code review, to better understand this process and how research and tool support can make developers become more effective and efficient reviewers. Previous work has provided evidence that a successful code review process is one in which reviewers and authors actively participate and collaborate. In these cases, the threads of discussions that are saved by code review tools are a precious source of information that can be later exploited for research and practice. In this paper, we focus on this source of information as a way to gather reliable data on the aforementioned reviewers' needs. We manually analyze 900 code review comments from three large open-source projects and organize them in categories by means of a card sort. Our results highlight the presence of seven high-level information needs, such as knowing the uses of methods and variables declared/modified in the code under review. Based on these results we suggest ways in which future code review tools can better support collaboration and the reviewing task.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "In this study, we address the role of Participatory Design (PD) in emerging public sector governance forms and, more specifically, civic engagement and we-government initiatives. We achieve this by first providing a research overview of the development of PD approaches since they originated in the 1970s, identifying different PD generations and associated concepts, contexts, and challenges, and then relating them to current public sector trends. Next, we link the overview to a practical example by presenting a case of applying PD to a civic engagement project that takes place in the Swedish emergency response system. Our example findings sustain previously identified needs to return to broad change processes and balance this with ICT re-configuration and structuration of the collaborative processes, the related stakeholders, and their needs, this time in a context where work tasks and responsibilities are not yet defined, known or experienced among stakeholders. We then suggest methodological ways to handle this by (1) applying an interdisciplinary PD approach, (2) replacing the traditional design group with a combination of various qualitative methods and PD techniques, e.g., focus groups, modified scenario-based future workshops, exercises, and after-action-reviews, and (3) support PD activities with context-specific frameworks. We argue that applying PD concepts to the governance forms that are emerging in resource-constrained public sector organizations poses a number of challenges, many of them relating directly to the unknown character of the work setting and the practical difficulties of involving civil citizens as end-users. However, if they are addressed and handled adequately, making civic engagement initiatives work processes and ICT support to work smoothly, this can contribute to a re-politicization of PD in terms of space, action, and the empowerment of citizens both by enhancing their skills and by having them represented in design activities.",

      "abstract": "Public discussions on social media platforms are an intrinsic part of online information consumption. Characterizing the diverse range of discussions that can arise is crucial for these platforms, as they may seek to organize and curate them. This paper introduces a computational framework to characterize public discussions, relying on a representation that captures a broad set of social patterns which emerge from the interactions between interlocutors, comments and audience reactions. We apply our framework to study public discussions on Facebook at two complementary scales. First, we use it to predict the eventual trajectory of individual discussions, anticipating future antisocial actions (such as participants blocking each other) and forecasting a discussion's growth. Second, we systematically analyze the variation of discussions across thousands of Facebook sub-communities, revealing subtle differences (and unexpected similarities) in how people interact when discussing online content. We further show that this variation is driven more by participant tendencies than by the content triggering these discussions.",

      "abstract": "Malaria surveillance is a practice concerned with collection and analysis of data. This paper presents an ethnographical account of an international team of researchers producing data about malaria in the Zanzibar archipelago. We show that malaria is increasingly an electronic entity, inextricably interwoven with the practices of data workers using ICT tools. The use of mobile ICT tools enables new data production practices that include situated coordination mechanisms such that 1) more people can be surveyed, including individuals not suffering from malaria but possibly carrying the parasite, 2) greater geographical areas can be covered, and 3) more data can be validated and included in malaria statistics. As electronic data, malaria builds and mobilizes diverse human, organizational, and infrastructural worlds around it, who must now be dedicated to its production, management, and care. We discuss implications for design of digital data collection tools that support the work of teams surveying malaria, as well as implications for disease surveillance methods and practices.",

      "abstract": "The increasing volume of text data is challenging the cognitive capabilities of expert analysts. Machine learning and crowdsourcing present new opportunities for large-scale sensemaking, but we must overcome the challenge of modeling the overall process so that many distributed agents can contribute to suitable components asynchronously and meaningfully. In this paper, we explore how to crowdsource the sensemaking process via a pipeline of modularized steps connected by clearly defined inputs and outputs. Our pipeline restructures and partitions information into \"context slices\" for individual workers. We implemented CrowdIA, a software platform to enable unsupervised crowd sensemaking using our pipeline. With CrowdIA, crowds successfully solved two mysteries, and were one step away from solving the third. The crowd’s intermediate results revealed their reasoning process and provided evidence that justifies their conclusions. We suggest broader possibilities to optimize each component, as well as to evaluate and refine previous intermediate analyses to improve the final result.",

      "abstract": "When and why do information dashboards enhance team productivity? We explore this question in the context of project teams whose members have to work across multiple teams at the same time. We expected multi-teaming, especially that involving a high variety in team members, would have a negative effect on team performance by impairing a team’s transactive memory system (TMS), a critical form of shared cognition allowing members to keep track of who knows what. Further, we expected the use of an information dashboard with member skills could combat the harmful effects of high-variety multi-teaming. To test our hypotheses experimentally, we developed an online game (Knowledge Worker’s Dilemma) that simulates the coordination decisions that professionals face in app development teams. Results show multi-teaming hurt team performance by reducing TMS; use of an information dashboard benefited high-variety teams and, surprisingly, hurt the performance of low-variety teams. Potential explanations and implications are discussed.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the relationship between design and intervention, and how scholars of computing and design might strengthen their repertoire of intervention amidst a pervasive sense of there being “no alternative” to structures of inequality and capitalist expansion. Drawing from the authors’ long-term ethnographic research on maker, entrepreneurship, and innovation cultures as well as their engagements with professional communities of computing and design, this paper introduces and theorizes modes of intervention that do not fit familiar images of political action such as the countercultural hero or localized resistance. The paper contributes by expanding the analytical repertoire of an interventionist-oriented social computing scholarship. Specifically, it offers three inter-related analytical sensibilities from feminist and critical race studies—“noticing differently,” “walking alongside” and “parasitic resistance”— to support political and activist approaches in CSCW and related fields.",

      "abstract": "Using ethnographic data, we provide a critical reflection on the discrepancies between the application of agile development principles and the conditions which render these principles effective for global software development work. This reflection is based on the analysis of a failed collaboration within a global software project, which relied heavily on feedback from mundane project tools utilized for everyday coordination and monitoring. Our study reveals that these tools hid serious issues relating to both the distribution of socio-technical skills and a discharge of accountability in task execution. As a result, markers of complex collaborative problems were concealed. Furthermore, the imbalance evident in outsourcing setups, which is enacted through high and low status task distribution among partners, further compounds collaboration problems by emphasizing assumptions about remote workers in the absence of direct forms of knowledge interchange.",

      "abstract": "Many smallholder coffee farmers in Latin America join cooperatives for increased access to global markets. This requires them to understand their costs relative to a complex sustainable coffee production process. To that end, we designed CalcuCafé, a web-based application for cooperative technicians and coffee farmers to calculate a farmer’s costs of coffee production. We iteratively developed and evaluated CalcuCafé’s design with members of two coffee cooperatives in Peru. Our research uncovered different expectations about the application between technicians and farmers, stemming from differing backgrounds, goals, and perspectives. Learning to use the application in a group setting helped overcome these differences and facilitated collaboration, resulting in a strong buy-in for the application. Our paper contributes a research and design effort to support smallholder coffee farmers, an underrecognized group at the intersection of HCI for sustainable agriculture and HCI for development.",

      "abstract": "As social media platforms become a larger part of sharing life, they have by necessity become a part of sharing death. In life, pop culture fans can have parasocial (one-sided, mediated) relationships with celebrities. Yet when fans of departed celebrities express their grief in public comment threads, conversations often result in disagreements about how to grieve. These disagreements consistently appear in response to the deaths of public figures, and have been broadly labeled “grief policing.” We performed a thematic analysis of public Facebook comments responding to the deaths of Alan Rickman, David Bowie, and Prince. Our findings describe prominent grief policing practices and explain how commenters may be importing norms from other contexts when shared spaces consist of transient interactions that make norm formation difficult. Our findings contribute to a broader understanding of how conflicting norms affect discourse in transient online spaces. Approaching online incivility through a lens of conflicting social norm enforcement may open doors for improvements in public discourse online.",

      "abstract": "Scientific discoveries are often driven by finding analogies in distant domains, but the growing number of papers makes it difficult to find relevant ideas in a single discipline, let alone distant analogies in other domains. To provide computational support for finding analogies across domains, we introduce SOLVENT, a mixed-initiative system where humans annotate aspects of research papers that denote their background (the high-level problems being addressed), purpose (the specific problems being addressed), mechanism (how they achieved their purpose), and findings (what they learned/achieved), and a computational model constructs a semantic representation from these annotations that can be used to find analogies among the research papers. We demonstrate that this system finds more analogies than baseline information-retrieval approaches; that annotators and annotations can generalize beyond domain; and that the resulting analogies found are useful to experts. These results demonstrate a novel path towards computationally supported knowledge sharing in research communities.",

      "abstract": "The key to successful adaptation for immigrants in a new country is their social capital, or those resources embedded in their social networks. Research suggests that information and communication technologies (ICTs) foster immigrants' social capital and facilitate their adaptation. However, it is unclear how recent immigrants use ICTs to develop social capital and how this supports their adaptation needs. We performed semi-structured interviews with thirteen recent immigrants and five long-term immigrants. We found that ICTs and technology-mediated connections: (1) easily addressed immigrants’ settlement needs, (2) minimally addressed their financial and cultural needs, and (3) were not used to address their emotional needs. To support recent immigrants’ adaptation, we suggest ways for ICTs to (1) reduce uncertainty about meeting local-born populations, (2) foster reciprocity among immigrant communities, and (3) facilitate safe resource exchanges.",

      "abstract": "Making effective use of patient-generated data (PGD) is challenging for both patients and providers. Designing systems to support collaborative and individual use of PGD is a topic of importance in CSCW, considering the limitations of informatics tools. To inform better system design, we conducted a study including focus groups, observations and interviews with patients and providers to understand how PGD is interpreted and used. We found that while PGD is useful for identifying and solving disease-related problems, the following differences in patient-provider perceptions challenge its effective use - different perceptions about what is a problem, selecting what kinds of problems to focus on, and using different data representations. Drawing on these insights, we reflect on two specific conceptualizations of disease management behavior (sensemaking and problem-solving) as they relate to data specific activities of patients and providers and provide design suggestions for tools to support collaborative and individual use of PGD.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Online experimentation with volunteers relies on participants' non-financial motivations to complete a study, such as to altruistically support science or to compare oneself to others. Researchers rely on these motivations to attract study participants and often use incentives, like performance comparisons, to encourage participation. Often, these study incentives are advertised using a slogan (e.g., ``What is your thinking style?''). Research on framing effects suggests that advertisement slogans attract people with varying demographics and motivations. Could the slogan advertisements for studies risk attracting only specific users? To investigate the existence of potential sample biases, we measured how different slogan frames affected which participants self-selected into studies. We found that slogan frames impact recruitment significantly; changing the slogan frame from a `supporting science' frame to a `comparing oneself to others' frame lead to a 9% increase in recruitment for some studies. Additionally, slogans framed as learning more about oneself attract participants significantly more motivated by boredom compared to other slogan frames. We discuss design implications for using frames to improve recruitment and mitigate sources of sample bias in online research with volunteers.",

We refer to feedback written in an unnecessary harsh tone as negative feedback. We conducted an online experiment to investigate the efficacy of three coping activities for mitigating the influence of negative feedback: self-affirmation, expressive writing, and distraction. Participants (N=480) received feedback sets with different balances of neutral and negative valence content and revised their essays after performing the assigned activity. We measured participants’ affective states, extents of revision, and their perceptions of the feedback and its providers. Our results showed even a small amount of negativity had significant adverse effects on all the measures. For the coping activities, we found that expressive writing encouraged essay revision, distraction improved affective states and feedback provider perception, and self-affirmation had no significant effects on the measures. Our results contribute further empirical knowledge of how negative valence feedback impacts content creators and how the coping activities tested mitigate these effects. We also offer practical guidelines regarding when and how to use the activities tested in online feedback platforms.",

We conducted 14 interviews with a variety of participants who collaborate as administrators and contributors of these online communities. The communities we examined have two central components: the citizens who crowd-sourced data about instances of crime in different neighborhoods in and around Mexico City, and the administrators of the Facebook sites who use the crowd-sourced data to intervene and collaborate with other stakeholders. From our interviews, we identify the community, data, and action practices used by group administrators to collect, curate, and publish information about public safety that would otherwise go unreported. The combination of these practices improves the reputation of the groups on Facebook, increases trust, and encourages sustained participation from citizens. These practices also legitimize data gathered by group members as an important grassroots tool for responding to issues of public safety that would otherwise not be reported or acted upon. Our findings contribute a growing body of work that aims to understand how social media enable political action in contexts where people are not being served by existing institutions.",

      "abstract": "This study builds upon the 30-years HCI research of collaborative writing and focuses on users’ experience of writing together in today’s context. By interviewing 30 participants from both academia and industry, the paper examines how people write together using today’s commercially available systems. The analysis focuses on the new co-editing capabilities (e.g., track changes) that are integrated into commercial tools and thus adopted by users widely in the last decade. These capabilities enable new ways of working together (e.g., directly edit the content at the character level at the same time), but users reported reluctance to fully commit to these new working styles. We thus systematically analyze users’ rationales of why they do not want to write together while they are writing together with other. We argue that the development of collaborative writing tools is far from finished and these findings provide insights for the design of technology, and suggest future directions for research.",

In this paper, we answer this question through a mixed-methods investigation. Through secondary analysis of interview data from 26 participants and an online questionnaire (N=285) we found three major interpretations of anonymity among AA and NA members: “unidentifiability,” “social contract,” and “program over individual.” While unidentifiability has been the focus of computing investigations, the other interpretations provide a significant and novel lens on anonymity. To understand how and when the unidentifiability interpretation was most likely to be enacted, we conducted a quantitative analysis of traces of activity in a large online recovery community. We observed that members were less likely to enact “unidentifiability” if they were more connected to the particular community and had more time in recovery. We provide implications for future research on context-specific anonymity and implications for design in online recovery spaces and similar sensitive contexts.",

Our goal is to understand if and how the multimodal affordances of SNS mediate participation and new literacies for dyslexic youth, and how these affordances interact with identity work. Seven young people struggling with literacy were interviewed about their use of SNS. Our results show that the visual affordances of SNS enable new forms of participation and expression, furthering our understanding of visual literacies. Nonetheless, despite the pervasive use of visual affordances to perform identity work, we also find that young people’s learning differences are not always obviated but re-constructed, or even confronted in SNS.",

Moreover, there are few tools to address the problem of protecting group privacy. This paper discusses an emerging class of software applications and services that pose new risks to group privacy by revealing group-level information based on individual information, such as social media postings or fitness app usage. The paper describes the results of two experiments that empirically establish the concept of group privacy  and shows that it affects user perceptions of and interactions with information technology.

      "abstract": "We report a study of peer support in online health communities for pregnancy care along three gestational stages (trimesters) to investigate how pregnant women seek and receive peer support during different stages of pregnancy. Using Babycenter.com as our research setting, we found that pregnant women sought peer support due to constrained access to healthcare providers, dissatisfaction with healthcare services/medical advice, limited offline social support, and unavailability of information in other venues. While the particular topics of concern typifying each trimester were distinct, pregnant women consistently sought advice, informal and formal knowledge, reassurance, and emotional support from peers during each stage of pregnancy. BabyCenter.com peers provided support by leveraging their own experiential knowledge and passing along clinical expertise acquired during the course of their own healthcare. We discuss design implications for health services and IT systems that meet pregnant women’s temporal and multi-faceted needs during prenatal care.",

      "abstract": "Dual processing theories in psychology suggest that people process persuasive requests by assessing the quality of arguments (systematic processing) or by relying on heuristic rules (heuristic processing). However, the factors that act as systematic and heuristic processing cues and affect the success of persuasion have not been adequately described in social lending contexts. This research examines the effectiveness of systematic and heuristic cues in persuasive requests in Kiva lending teams intended to convince members to donate. An analysis of 88,596 requests exchanged in 1,610 teams shows that certain heuristic processing cues (e.g.,liking between requesters and potential lenders, advocates low authority in their teams and the importance of the team to the lender) strongly predicted whether lenders would contribute to a  loan  request.   In  contrast,  cues  that  required systematic  processing  are  less  influential. We also found that behavioral cues are more important than verbal ones. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our work.",

These personal informatics (PI) and quantified self (QS) technologies are designed to help users capture, reflect on, and get actionable information about personal data. In the past (and still in many cases), the design of such systems emphasized an individual-centric vantage point that focused on supporting an individual’s self-tracking, self-knowledge, and self-management activities. Over time, however, a growing number of PI researchers are recognizing that such practices are socially motivated, collaboratively conducted, and embedded in interpersonal contexts, in ways that extend well beyond single-user use cases and requirements. This is resulting in the appearance of a host of new theories, methods, and frameworks for understanding social contexts and practices within PI literature and design spaces.",

In this paper, we conduct a study to further the understanding of which factors from prior work in both OSS and art communities are predictive of successful collaboration – defined as reuse of previous songs – in three different songwriting communities, namely Songtree, Splice, and ccMixter. The main findings from this study confirm that the success of collaborations is associated with high community status of recognizable authors and low degree of derivativity of songs.",

We explore the transition disclosure practices of Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) students who are transitioning from an individualistic culture to one that is highly collective. As ROTC students routinely evaluate their peers through a ranking system, the act of disclosure may impact a student's ability to secure limited opportunities within the military upon graduation. Through a qualitative interview study of active ROTC students (N=14) examining how they use information communication technologies (ICTs) to disclose their struggles in a hyper-competitive environment, we find they engage in a process of highly selective disclosure, choosing different groups with which to disclose based on the types of issues they face. We share implications for designing ICTs that better facilitate how ROTC students cope with personal challenges during their formative transition into the military.",

We construct a “shared audience graph”, revealing structural and ideological disparities between two groups of participants (one on the political left, the other on the political right). We utilize an integrated networked gatekeeping and framing lens to examine how #BlackLivesMatter frames were produced—and how they were contested—by separate communities of supporters and critics. Among other empirical findings, this work demonstrates hashtags being used in diverse ways—e.g. to mark participation, assert individual identity, promote group identity, and support or challenge a frame. Considered from a networked gatekeeping perspective, we illustrate how hashtags can serve as channeling mechanisms, shaping trajectories of information flow. This analysis also reveals a right-leaning community of BlackLivesMatter critics to have a more well-defined group of crowdsourced elite who largely define their side’s counter-frame.",

We combine a user-centred approach to understanding lived experiences of families (interviews, design workshops) with an expert-led understanding of what makes interventions psychologically effective. Our findings suggest the potential of technology to enable a shift in how prevention interventions are designed and delivered: empowering children and parents through a new model of `child-led, situated interventions', where participants learn through actionable support directly within family life, as opposed to didactic in-person workshops and a subsequent `skills application'. This conceptual model was then instantiated in a technology probe, which was deployed with 14 families. The promising field study findings provide an initial proof-of-concept validation of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Most US social media users engage regularly with multiple platforms. For LGBTQ+ people, this means making self-presentation decisions not just on one platform, but many. These choices are made in the face of sometimes-overlapping platform environments, which can have consequentially different norms, audiences, and affordances. Moreover, many LGBTQ+ users face high stakes in online self-presentation, due to the risk of stigmatization of their LGBTQ+ identity, increasing the importance of self-presentation decisions that enable them to achieve their goals and avoid stigmatization. This combination of environmental complexity and high stakes is not adequately accounted for in existing work on self-presentation, but doing so is important to support and understand the experiences of LGBTQ+ and other potentially stigmatized users. We adopt an ecological approach to an interview and cognitive mapping study of 20 LGBTQ+ social media users. We find that participants employ the platforms, audiences, affordances, and norms within what we call their “personal social media ecosystems” to avoid stigmatization while still allowing for expression of their LGBTQ+ identity and the flexibility to adjust their presentation over time.",

      "abstract": "Behavioral statescan be transferred to others, leading people to behave in ways similar to those around them. Can this phenomenon of behavioral contagion be seen in the workplace? Using employees’ organizational social media data and their workplace hierarchical network structure, we studied contagion across a large multinational corporation, focusing on an important workplace behavior – employee engagement. We measured employees’ engagement based on their word choice in organizational social media, and we applied a longitudinal statistical technique which controls for homophily, employees’ traits and prior expressions of engagement. We found that engagement and disengagement spread from one employee to another with direct peers exerting the strongest influence. While engagement-spread was more powerful laterally among people at the same organizational level, disengagement-spread followed the vertical managerial chain. Further, we found that disengaged co-workers exerted a stronger influence on employee’s future engagement compared to the engaged co-workers. Our results suggest the need for organizations to sense and address workplace disengagement promptly. Moreover, our findings offer opportunities for using workplace interventions to promote engagement and mitigate disengagement.",

We thus draw on and extend research that examines challenges facing public health infrastructures in underserved contexts by taking a critical feminist approach. Using Haraway's lens of situated knowledges, we highlight the disconnects present across the partial perspectives of the clinics' stakeholders, including the healthcare providers, community health workers, and patient groups. We also analyze how these disconnects affect collaborations, negotiations, and contestations around healthcare. Finally, we provide takeaways from our research towards bridging disconnected knowledges by way of redesigning healthcare interventions, revisiting patient empowerment, and redefining the role of frontline health workers as key infomediaries.",

      "abstract": "Among platform designers there is still little actionable knowledge about how to foster community engagement, and new community platforms are likely to fail. Much research has documented effects that could inform better designs, however there is a lack of practical methods to review particular concerns. We design a lightweight method for systematic reviews of community engagement scenarios, based on a catalogue of 59 techniques, presented in the form of method cards, and co-developed with community engagement experts. We validate it in problem-solving workshops with organisers, and find that a full review is feasible in under 15 minutes, that it provides effective prompts and important guidance, and can successfully support process innovation. Finally, we validate it for use in summative evaluations of online communities. In a large-scale observational study of 1 million Flickr users, application of the method reveals the surprising impact of a major site redesign: it successfully increased content engagement, but at the expense of social interactions.",

We show that this is a recurring problem in many domains, present machine-human (hybrid) algorithms that screen items efficiently and estimate the gain over human-only or machine-only screening in terms of performance and cost. We further show how, given a new classification problem and a set of classifiers of unknown accuracy for the problem at hand, we can identify how to manage the cost-accuracy trade off by progressively determining if we should spend budget to obtain test data (to assess the accuracy of the given classifiers), or to train an ensemble of classifiers, or whether we should leverage the existing machine classifiers with the crowd, and in this case how to efficiently combine them based on their estimated characteristics to obtain the classification. We demonstrate that the techniques we propose obtain significant cost/accuracy improvements with respect to the leading classification algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Although informal online learning communities are made possible by users’ decisions to share their creations, participation by females and other marginalized groups remains stubbornly low in technical communities. Using descriptive statistics and a unique dataset of shared and unshared projects from over 1.1 million users of Scratch—a collaborative programming community for young people—we show that while girls share less initially, this trend flips among experienced users. Using Bayesian regression analyses, we show that this relationship can largely be attributed to differences in the way boys and girls participate. We also find that while prior positive feedback is correlated with increased sharing among inexperienced users, this effect also reverses with experience or with the addition of controls. Our findings provide a description of the dynamics behind online learners’ decisions to share, open new research questions, and point to several lessons for system designers.",

Social media companies are now problematizing some campaigns, specifically those that intentionally obscure their origins, as ‘information operations’. This research examines how social media accounts linked to one such operation—allegedly conducted by Russia’s Internet Research Agency—participated in an online discourse about the #BlackLivesMatter movement and police-related shootings in the U.S. during 2016. We study the interactions of these accounts within the online crowd using interpretative analysis of a network graph based on retweet flows in combination with a qualitative content analysis. Our empirical findings show how these accounts imitated ordinary users to systematically micro-target different audiences, foster antagonism and undermine trust in information intermediaries. Conceptually, this research enhances our understanding of how information operations can leverage the interactive social media environment to both reflect and shape existing social divisions.",

      "abstract": "A new kind of online movement has emerged on social media: identity hashtag movements, through which individuals share \"selfies\" and personal stories to elucidate the experiences of marginalized social groups. These movements have the potential to counteract bias and enable social justice, but are enacted in a forum rife with identity and boundary management concerns. To understand this type of movement, we present a qualitative study of #ILookLikeAnEngineer, a hashtag created to challenge engineering stereotypes. We interviewed 32 people, including participants and non-participants of the movement, about their experiences with the hashtag. We found that personally identifiable participation promoted feelings of empowerment and strengthened connections within the marginalized community. At the same time, the personal and professional identity focus raised ambiguity about the boundaries of the collective and the movement's ability to change stereotypes. We discuss implications for online collective action and the use of social media for addressing stereotypes.",

      "abstract": "Prior research suggests that public negative feedback on social knowledge sharing platforms can be powerfully demotivating to newcomers, particularly when it involves peer feedback mechanisms such as ratings and commenting systems. What is the impact on newcomer retention when feedback is private, and from a single peer reviewer? We study these effects using the example of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, a Wikipedia-style social mapping platform where the review process is closer to a teacher-learner model rather than a public peer review. We observe peer feedback for early contributions by 1,300 newcomers, and assess the impact of different classes of feedback, including performance feedback, corrective feedback, and verbal rewards. We find that verbal rewards and immediate feedback can have a powerful effect on newcomer retention. In order to better support such positive engagement effects, we recommend that system designers conceptually distinguish between mechanisms for quality control and for learner feedback.",

      "abstract": "The ´project’ is a prevalent form for organising endeavours of construction, innovation, IT development and organisational change. ‘Projects’ involve coordination and cooperation between colocated and distributed actors, and are relevant for CSCW (computer supported cooperative work) research as a particular kind of cooperative work. A survey of CSCW publications only identified 26 papers that explicitly address project management (PM), of which most primarily focus on IT development. We argue that CSCW’s conceptual and methodological tools can make significant contributions to PM research, practice and its computational support. We point to four issues of relevance for future CSCW research on projects: continue to sophisticate the empirical and conceptual understanding of projects, broaden research beyond IT projects into other domains, develop agile approaches beyond IT development and focus on computational support for project work and management. In all, we argue that CSCW can advance our understanding of project work and management and the design of adequate computational support.",

      "abstract": "Software is an integral element of the work of science yet it is not commonly an object of inquiry in studies of scientific infrastructures. This paper presents findings from an ethnographic study of a cosmology group’s collaborative scientific software production. We demonstrate how these cosmologists use plots to simultaneously test their software and analyze data while interrogating multiple layers of infrastructural components. We broaden perspectives on scientific software development using a sociotechnical, software studies lens to examine this work of scientific discovery as a creative and embodied, yet exacting and methodical, activity that requires a ‘human in the loop’. We offer a new reading of scientific software practices to convey how creating scientific software is often really the act of doing science itself—an intervention we believe is necessary to more successfully support scientific software sharing and infrastructure production.",

      "abstract": "Researchers have focused intensively on the emotional effects of browsing social media, with many emphasizing possible negative effects and others suggesting the positive emotions in status updates are contagious. Despite this focus, however, very few studies have investigated the actual emotional experience of browsing social media in the moment, and none with more than a few emotions, making it difficult to understand the effects research should endeavor to explain. To address this gap, I use experience sampling with diverse samples of Facebook (N = 362) and Twitter (N = 416) users, assessing the browsing experience across a wide range of emotions. Surprisingly, results provide little evidence of robust positive or negative effects, suggesting instead that the primary effect of browsing social media is a lessening of arousal. That is, contrary to stereotype, people tend to wind down — feel more relaxed, sleepy, bored and so on — not wind up.",

Biosignals can help us achieve a deeper understanding of each other by revealing or clarifying the psychological processes that underlie our subjective experience. We conducted an exploratory study investigating expressive biosignals, comparing the influence of a variety of brain activity visualizations on impression formation. Results revealed that while participants readily infer emotional and cognitive states from visualized brain activity, the ambiguity of the data can lead to diverse perceptions and interpretations. Participants also expressed concerns that the observation of another individual's data during interaction might be invasive or distracting. We present a set of design considerations addressing issues of interpretability, integration, and privacy of biosignals in interpersonal contexts.",

Tracing the tumultuous history of one of the first examples of computer-supported cooperative learning (CSCL) allows us to question some present-day assumptions regarding the universal appeal of learning to program computers that undergirds popular CSCL initiatives today, including the Scratch programming environment and the “FabLab” makerspace movement. Furthermore, teasing out the individualistic and anti-authority threads in this project and its links to present day narratives of technology development exposes the deeply atomized and even oppositional notions of collaboration in these projects and others under the auspices of CSCW today that draw on early notions of ‘hacker culture.’ These notions tend to favor a limited view of work, learning, and practice—an invisible constraint that continues to inform how we build and evaluate CSCW technologies.",

      "abstract": "Following successful crowd ideation contests, organizations in search of the \"next big thing\" are left with hundreds of ideas. Expert-based idea filtering is lengthy and costly; therefore, crowd-based strategies are often employed. Unfortunately, these strategies typically (1) do not separate the mediocre from the excellent, and (2) direct all the attention to certain idea concepts, while others starve. We introduce DBLemons - a crowd-based idea filtering strategy that addresses these issues by (1) asking voters to identify the worst rather than the best ideas using a ``bag of lemons'' voting approach, and (2) by exposing voters to a wider idea spectrum, thanks to a dynamic diversity-based ranking system balancing idea quality and coverage. We compare DBLemons against two state-of-the-art idea filtering strategies in a real-world setting. Results show that DBLemons is more accurate, less time-consuming, and reduces the idea space in half while still retaining 94% of the top ideas.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) are widely used by organizations, researchers, and individuals to outsource a broad range of tasks to crowd workers. Prior research has shown that crowdsourcing can pose privacy risks (e.g., de-anonymization) to crowd workers. However, little is known about the specific privacy issues crowd workers have experienced and how they perceive the state of privacy in crowdsourcing. In this paper, we present results from an online survey of 435 MTurk crowd workers from the US, India, and other countries and areas. Our respondents reported different types of privacy concerns (e.g., data aggregation, profiling, scams), experiences of privacy losses (e.g., phishing, malware, stalking, targeted ads), and privacy expectations on MTurk (e.g., screening tasks). Respondents from multiple countries and areas reported experiences with the same privacy issues, suggesting that these problems may be endemic to the whole MTurk platform. We discuss challenges, high-level principles and concrete suggestions in protecting crowd workers' privacy on MTurk and in crowdsourcing more broadly.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we describe the insights from an exploratory qualitative pilot study testing the feasibility of a solution that would encourage older adults to participate in online crowdsourcing tasks in a non-computer scenario. Therefore, we developed an Android TV application using Amara API to retrieve subtitles for TEDx talks which allows the participants to detect and categorize errors to support the quality of the translation and transcription processes. It relies on the older adults' innate skills as long-time native language users and the motivating factors of this socially and personally beneficial task. The study allowed us to verify the underlying concept of using Smart TVs as interfaces for crowdsourcing, as well as possible barriers, including the interface, configuration issues, topics and the process itself. We have also assessed the older adults' interaction and engagement with this TV-enabled online crowdsourcing task and we are convinced that the design of our setup addresses some key barriers to crowdsourcing by older adults. It also validates avenues for further research in this area focused on such considerations as autonomy and freedom of choice, familiarity, physical and cognitive comfort as well as building confidence and the edutainment value.",

      "abstract": "In 2015, Reddit closed several subreddits-foremost among them r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown-due to violations of Reddit's anti-harassment policy. However, the effectiveness of banning as a moderation approach remains unclear: banning might diminish hateful behavior, or it may relocate such behavior to different parts of the site. We study the ban of r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown in terms of its effect on both participating users and affected subreddits. Working from over 100M Reddit posts and comments, we generate hate speech lexicons to examine variations in hate speech usage via causal inference methods. We find that the ban worked for Reddit. More accounts than expected discontinued using the site; those that stayed drastically decreased their hate speech usage-by at least 80%. Though many subreddits saw an influx of r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown \"migrants,\" those subreddits saw no significant changes in hate speech usage. In other words, other subreddits did not inherit the problem. We conclude by reflecting on the apparent success of the ban, discussing implications for online moderation, Reddit and internet communities more broadly.",

Effective fertility treatment requires continuous monitoring of a wide range of health indicators through self-tracking. The process of collecting and interpreting data and information about fertility is complex, and much of the burden falls on women. In this study, we analyzed patient-generated content in a popular online health community dedicated to fertility issues. The objective was to understand the process in which women engage in tracking relevant information, and the challenges they face. Leveraging the Personal Informatics Model, we describe women’s self-tracking experiences during their fertility cycles. We discuss how a complex and highly personalized context leads to responsibility, pressure, and emotional burden on women performing self-tracking activities, as well as the role of collaboration in creating individualized solutions. Finally, we provide implications for technologies aiming to support women with fertility care needs.",

We conducted an observational lab study to examine how preschoolers (age 3-5) and parents (N=74) from three different regions of the world (communities in China, Taiwan, and the United States) engage with two types of tablet games: an instructional game with goals and an exploratory, open-ended game. We found systematic differences among groups and between games. For example, parents from China and Taiwan frequently picked up their child’s hand and used it as a tool to engage with the screen, a practice parents in our U.S. sample did not employ. Dyads from all three samples exhibited more warmth when playing an instructional game than an exploratory one. Our results suggest that characteristics of the populations we sampled interact with design features—that is, the same design prompted opposing behaviors in different groups. We conclude that it may be useful to examine goal-free and goal-oriented JME as separate constructs, that design choices influence the roles parents adopt during JME, and that the range of behaviors we observed complicate the prevailing research narrative of what positive and productive JME looks like.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays people have many overlapping relationships across different social network sites. Will the communication frequency of a relationship on a focal SNS increase or decrease after the corresponding parties begin interacting with each other on a new SNS? What kinds of relationships and parties on the focal SNS are more robust to relationship overlapping across different sites? We conducted a case study on two Chinese popular social network sites (Weibo and Douban). Our results indicate that relationships' interactions on a new SNS have negative effect on the parties' communication frequency on the focal SNS. The communication frequency of older relationships on the focal SNS is more susceptible to the influence of the interacting on the new SNS, while relationships with more common groups and more extensive posts are less likely to be influenced. Our findings imply opportunities for SNS designers to strengthen their existing fragile ties and help users to build much more robust relationships.",

      "abstract": "CSCW scholarship has previously addressed how professionals use digital technologies for learning and communication, but limited attention has been paid to professional self-disclosure on social media. Acts of self-disclosure—intentionally revealing personal information to others—are often considered beneficial for communication and formation of relationships, and describing the role of disclosure in professional communication is important to advance CSCW research that focuses on occupations or organizational settings. In this paper, we present a mixed-methods study of professional self-disclosure in an online community focused on user experience design (UX), documenting how acts of self-disclosure may support professional development. We found that self-disclosure was frequently used as an effective rhetorical and content-focused strategy to provoke discussions and request assistance with the goal of developing or maintaining professional competence. Through the identification of these self-disclosure strategies, we discuss professional self-disclosure in relation to professional identity development in online communities.",

      "abstract": "Emoji are popular in digital communication, but they are rendered differently on different viewing platforms (e.g., iOS, Android). It is unknown how many people are aware that emoji have multiple renderings, or whether they would change their emoji-bearing messages if they could see how these messages render on recipients’ devices. We developed software to expose the multi-rendering nature of emoji and explored whether this increased visibility would affect how people communicate with emoji. Through a survey of 710 Twitter users who recently posted an emoji-bearing tweet, we found that at least 25% of respondents were unaware that the emoji they posted could appear differently to their followers. Additionally, after being shown how one of their tweets rendered across platforms, 20% of respondents reported that they would have edited or not sent the tweet. These statistics reflect millions of potentially regretful tweets shared per day because people cannot see emoji rendering differences across platforms. Our results motivate the development of tools that increase the visibility of emoji rendering differences across platforms, and we contribute our cross-platform emoji rendering software to facilitate this effort.",

This shift to digital transactions can create challenges for those without reliable home internet connections or with limited digital literacy by requiring them to submit sensitive information on public computers or on unfamiliar websites. Using interviews with 52 families from high-poverty communities in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S., we explore the compounding privacy and security challenges that economically disadvantaged individuals face when navigating online services. We describe the real, perceived, and unknown risks they face as they navigate online transactions with limited technical skills, as well as the strategies and heuristics they employ to minimize these risks. The findings highlight a complex relationship between participants’ negative experiences and their general mistrust of sharing data through online channels. We also describe a range of strategies participants use to try and protect their personal information. Based on these findings, we offer design recommendations to inform the creation of educational resources that we will develop in the next phase of this project.",

      "abstract": "The Guardian---the fifth most widely read online newspaper in the world as of 2014---changed conversations on its commenting platform by altering its design from non-threaded to single-level threaded in 2012. We studied this naturally occurring experiment to investigate the impact of conversation threading on user retention as mediated by several potential changes in conversation structure and style. Our analysis shows that the design change made new users significantly more likely to comment a second time, and that this increased stickiness is due in part to a higher fraction of comments receiving responses after the design change. In mediation analysis, other anticipated mechanisms such as reciprocal exchanges and comment civility did not help to explain users' decision to return to the commenting system; indeed, civility did not increase after the design change and reciprocity declined. These analyses show that even simple design choices can have a significant impact on news forums' stickiness. Further, they suggest that this influence is more powerfully shaped by affordances---the new system made responding easier---than by changes in users' attention to social norms of reciprocity or civility. This has an array of implications for designers.",

      "abstract": "Wikipedia has a strong norm of writing in a ``neutral point of view'' (NPOV). Articles that violate this norm are tagged, and editors are encouraged to make corrections. But the impact of this tagging system has not been quantitatively measured. Does NPOV tagging help articles to converge to the desired style? Do NPOV corrections encourage editors to adopt this style? We study these questions using a corpus of NPOV-tagged articles and a set of lexicons associated with biased language. An interrupted time series analysis shows that after an article is tagged for NPOV, there is a significant decrease in biased language in the article, as measured by several lexicons. However, for individual editors, NPOV corrections and talk page discussions yield no significant change in the usage of words in most of these lexicons, including Wikipedia's own list of ``words to watch.'' This suggests that NPOV tagging and discussion does improve content, but has less success enculturating editors to the site's linguistic norms.",

      "abstract": "Real-time collaboration between a requester and crowd workers expands the scope of tasks that crowdsourcing can be used for by letting requesters and crowd workers interactively create various artifacts (e.g., a sketch prototype, writing, or program code). In such systems, it is increasingly common to allow requesters to verbally describe their requests, receive responses from workers, and provide immediate and continuous feedback to enhance the overall outcome of the two groups' real-time collaboration. This work is motivated by the lack of a deep understanding of the challenges that end users of such systems face in their communication with workers and the need of design implications that can address such challenges for other similar systems. In this paper, we investigate how requesters verbally communicate and collaborate with crowd workers to solve a complex task. Using a crowd-powered UI design tool, we conducted a qualitative user study to explore how requesters with varying expertise communicate and collaborate with crowd workers. Our work also identifies the unique challenges that collaborative crowdsourcing systems pose: potential expertise differences between requesters and crowd workers, the asymmetry of two-way communication (e.g., speech versus text), and the shared artifact's concurrent modification by two disparate groups. Finally, we make design recommendations that can inform the design of future real-time collaboration processes in crowdsourcing systems.",

      "abstract": "Design instructors are integrating the use of online peer review platforms to keep pace with growing class sizes. However, these platforms typically prioritize randomized peer assignment strategies and show only the current solution to peers when writing feedback. This can result in low quality feedback in project-based design courses. We report on an experiment in which students (N=59) worked on twelve-week design projects and both wrote and received online feedback at four stages. The experiment tested a novel assignment strategy of peer mentorship, where peers were assigned to give feedback to all stages of the same project, and tested showing the context from the preceding design stage when composing feedback. The results showed that displaying the context from the preceding design stage led to feedback with higher perceived quality at the late design stages (but not at earlier stages) and feedback from mentors prompts longer responses from the feedback recipients. Our work contributes deeper empirical understanding of how assignment strategies and showing additional context affects peer feedback and provides practical guidelines for instructors to implement these methods in design courses.",

      "abstract": "Check-in data from social networks provide researchers a unique opportunity to model human dynamics at scale. However, it is unclear how indicative these check-in traces are of real human mobility. Prior work showed that a significant portion of Foursquare check-ins did not match with the physical mobility patterns of users, and suggested that misrepresented check-ins were incentivized by external rewards provided by the system. In this paper, our goal is to understand the root cause of inaccurate check-in data, by studying its validity in social media platforms without external rewards for check-ins. We conduct a data-driven analysis using an empirical check-in trace of more than 276,000 users from WeChat Moments, with matching traces of their physical mobility. We develop a set of hypotheses on the underlying motivations behind people's inaccurate check-ins, and validate them using a detailed user study which includes both surveys and interviews. Our analysis reveals that there are a surprisingly large number of inaccurate check-ins even in the absence of rewards: 43% of total check-ins are inaccurate and 61% of survey participants report they have misrepresented their check-ins. We also find that inaccurate check-ins are often a result of user interface design as well as for convenience, commercial advertisement and self-presentation.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Research in computer-supported cooperative work has historically focused on behaviors of individuals at scale, using frames of interpersonal interaction such as Goffman's theories of self-presentation. These frames prioritize research detailing the characteristics, personal identities, and behaviors of large numbers of interacting individuals, while the social identity concepts that lead to intra- and inter-group dynamics have received far less attention. We argue that the emergent properties of self-categorization and social identity, which are particularly fluid and complex in online spaces, provide a complementary perspective with which to re-examine traditional topics in social computing. We discuss the applicability of the Social Identity Perspective to both established and new research domains in CSCW, proposing alternative perspectives on self-presentation, social support, collaboration, misbehavior, and leadership. We propose a set of methodological considerations derived from this body of theories and accompanying empirical work. We close by considering how broad concepts and lessons from social identity provide a valuable lens for inspiring future work in CSCW.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "We study the inclusion of a social awareness stream (SAS) in the peer-to-peer payment app Venmo. While SASs are prominent in many social network sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, Venmo’s use offers an illustrative example of how SASs can be used in task-oriented apps, particularly in a domain, finance, which people often view as sensitive. Through interviews with 14 Venmo users and surveys of 164 peer-to-peer payment app users and 80 Venmo users, we find uses consistent with other SASs and uncover novel uses that reflect the unusual inclusion of an SAS within a utilitarian app for personal finance. For many users, the SAS is a flexible feature that creates an experience that blends their task-driven use with social benefits. People write purely functional transaction descriptions with strangers, while in transactions with friends, they sometimes craft playful descriptions that enhance their experience or perform their social relationships. The SAS provides opportunities for learning about how to use the application and for keeping up with friends. The results of this study extend the CSCW community’s knowledge of SASs and offer guidance to designers considering use of SAS in a variety of applications.",

      "abstract": "Public WiFi networks are increasingly viewed as last-mile Internet solutions for rural areas given the infrastructure intensive nature of fibre optic broadband connectivity, but how inclusive are they? This study reports on interviews, observations, and practices around WiFi access points in public spaces in a rural community in India. It illustrates the ways in which Internet savvy women may continue to experience exclusions in Internet access and use. Bound by social norms that restrict their movements and tether them to spotty mobile data, women’s Internet usage is limited in comparison to men, whose relatively unconstrained mobility permits them access and use of the free WiFi in the community. Additionally, interviews with a commercial WiFi provider reveals naive assumptions about women’s Internet habits and gendered mobilities constraining access. The findings suggest that in certain contexts, women may remain invisible as potential customers despite their desire and ability to pay for WiFi access.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Time bounded events such as hackathons, data dives, codefests, hack-days, sprints or edit-a-thons have increasingly gained attention from practitioners and researchers. Existing research, however, has mainly focused on the event itself, while potential outcomes of hackathons have received limited attention. Furthermore, most research around hackathons focuses on collegiate or civic events. Research around hackathons internal to tech companies, which are nearly ubiquitous, and present significant organizational, cultural, and managerial challenges, remains scarce. In this paper we address this gap by presenting findings from a case study of five teams which participated in a large scale corporate hackathon. Most team members voiced their intentions to continue the projects their worked on during the hackathon, but those whose projects did get continued were characterized by meticulous preparation, a focus on executing a shared vision during the hackathon, extended dissemination activities afterwards and a fit to existing product lines. Such teams were led by individuals who perceived the hackathon as an opportunity to bring their idea to life and advance their careers, and who recruited teams who had a strong interest in the idea and in learning the skills necessary to contribute efficiently. Our analysis also revealed that individual team members perceived hackathon participation to have positive effects on their career parts, networks and skill development.",

We consider bias and discrimination in the context of popular online dating and hookup platforms in the United States, which we call intimate platforms. Drawing on work in social-justice-oriented and Queer HCI, we review design features of popular intimate platforms and their potential role in exacerbating or mitigating interpersonal bias. We argue that focusing on platform design can reveal opportunities to reshape troubling patterns of intimate contact without overriding users' decisional autonomy. We identify and address the difficult ethical questions that nevertheless come along with such intervention, while urging the social computing community to engage more deeply with issues of bias, discrimination, and exclusion in the study and design of intimate platforms.",

To attain a deeper understanding of the practices of frontline health workers engaged in data collection, we conducted fieldwork in underserved contexts of Delhi, India. In particular, we interviewed these workers and observed their interactions with 200 households. Our analysis takes a postcolonial feminist perspective to examine how these frontline health workers navigate the multiple demands placed on them by their families, society, local residents, and health organizations.

      "abstract": "We present Domino, a descriptive framework for hybrid collaboration and hybrid coupling styles in partially distributed teams. Domino enables researchers to describe, analyze, and understand real-world hybrid collaboration practices, i.e., collaborative practices that involve simultaneous co-located and remote collaboration with phases of both synchronous and asynchronous work that spans multiple groupware applications and devices. It also helps to categorize collaborative activities based on yet undocumented hybrid coupling styles between the members of multiple partially distributed or co-located subgroups. Our Domino framework was derived from initial observations of real-world practice and refined by the detailed analysis of participants' behavior and working styles during a simulation of a complex hybrid collaboration task with six partially distributed teams of four users in our lab. The resulting framework allows researchers to view collaboration through a new analytical lens, apply new analytical tools, and also derive implications for the design of collaborative systems.",

      "abstract": "Computer mediated-communication tools (CMC) support loved ones in maintaining connections with one another over distance, yet it can be difficult to actually do activities together. We studied the use of telepresence robots for supporting distance-separated loved ones in engaging in the joint activity of shopping over distance. One partner shopped in person while the other used a telepresence robot from a remote location. As a point of comparison, we had a second group of participants use video chat on a tablet, instead of a telepresence robot. Compared to the tablet group, we found that when partners communicated through a telepresence robot, the remote partner’s personality and presence were strongly expressed through the movements and physicality of the medium. However, the use of the telepresence robot introduced tension between partners regarding responsibility, dependency, and contribution to the act of shopping. These results demonstrate the benefits of a mobile embodiment for remote partners, as well as the need for greater physical capabilities to support both physical connection and remote contribution to leisure activities.",

      "abstract": "Current collaborative photo privacy protection solutions can be categorized into two approaches: controlling the recipient, which restricts certain viewers' access to the photo, and controlling the content, which protects all or part of the photo from being viewed. Focusing on the latter approach, we introduce privacy-enhancing obfuscations for photos and conduct an online experiment with 271 participants to evaluate their effectiveness against human recognition and how they affect the viewing experience. Results indicate the two most common obfuscations, blurring and pixelating, are ineffective. On the other hand, inpainting, which removes an object or person entirely, and avatar, which replaces content with a graphical representation are effective. From a viewer experience perspective, blurring, pixelating, inpainting, and avatar are preferable. Based on these results, we suggest inpainting and avatar may be useful as privacy-enhancing technologies for photos, because they are both effective at increasing privacy for elements of a photo and provide a good viewer experience.",

      "abstract": "Peer production communities often struggle to retain contributors beyond initial engagement. This may be a result of contributors' level of motivation, as it is deeply intertwined with activity. Existing studies on participation focus on activity dynamics but overlook the accompanied changes in motivation. To fill this gap, this study examines the interplay between contributors’ fun motives and activity over time. We combine motivational data from two surveys of Wikipedia newcomers with data of two periods of editing activity. We find that persistence in editing is related to fun, while the amount of editing is not: individuals who persist in editing are characterized by higher fun motives early on (when compared to dropouts), though their motives are not related to the number of edits made. Moreover, we found that newcomers’ experience of fun was reinforced by their amount of activity over time: editors who were initially motivated by fun entered a virtuous cycle, whereas those who initially had low fun motives entered a vicious cycle. Our findings shed new light on the importance of early experiences and reveal that the relationship between motivation and participation levels is more complex than previously understood.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a field study on using peer-based cooperative fitness tracking (PCFT) to promote workplace fitness. The social bonding achieved through a collective fitness goal and the sharing of fitness data between two co-workers has been explored as a motivational factor that can encourage physical activity. The study involved 10 dyads of co-workers in two groups (a distributed vs. a co-located group) based on their proximity at work. The effectiveness of the proposed PCFT was examined by comparing fitness data over a period of three weeks: the baseline week, the PCFT intervention week, and the post-intervention week. The proximity effects on PCFT were investigated by comparing the fitness data, goal commitment, and interview results between the two groups. The quantitative results showed that the physical activity of participants in the co-located group improved significantly after the PCFT intervention. The qualitative results suggested that PCFT may improve the awareness of being physically active, stimulate exchange of knowledge to support active lifestyles and facilitate including fitness breaks in the daily work routine. Based on these findings, we discuss design implications for the future development of the PCFT-based applications and their potential contribution to increased office vitality.",

Interview outcomes informed metrics for our bibliometric analysis of gender and collaboration in papers published between 1996 and 2016 in three top HCI and ML conferences.

Prevalent approaches to emotional biosensing are too limited, focusing on the individual, optimization, and normative categorization. Conceptual shifts can help explore alternatives: toward materiality, from representation toward performativity, inter-action to intra-action, shifting biopolitics, and shifting affect/desire. We contribute (1) synthesizing wide-ranging conceptual lenses, providing analysis connecting them to emotional biosensing design, (2) analyzing selected design exemplars to apply these lenses to design research, and (3) offering our own recommendations for designers and design researchers. In particular we suggest humility in knowledge claims with emotional biosensing, prioritizing care and affirmation over self-improvement, and exploring alternative desires. We call for critically questioning and generatively re-imagining the role of data in configuring sensing, feeling, ‘the good life,’ and everyday experience.",

      "abstract": "We describe more than 19 months of ethnographic fieldwork with people who have embraced minimalism, a lifestyle movement focused on reducing modern life's clutter. We found that for minimalists, the home is a central but porous site for making and staging their values around objects. The home's porous boundary allows minimalists to reinforce their values around objects for others and themselves, but it also necessitates adopting strategies to assert their values when objects---entangled with others' values---move in and out the boundaries of the home. Drawing from our fieldwork, we introduce the concept of the porous boundary. \"Porosity\" impels us to consider the coupling of objects with values as we do boundary practices for the home. A porous boundary perspective, we argue, can open new design spaces in the development of novel technologies for the home.",

The problem gets worse when more computer-generated filters are introduced. To enhance filter findability, we semantically name and organize color effects leveraging data curated by creative communities online. We first model semantic mappings between color themes and keywords in everyday language. Next, we index and organize each filter by the derived semantic information. We conduct three separate studies to investigate the benefit of the semantic features on filter exploration.

      "abstract": "Stress constitutes a persistent wellbeing challenge to college students, impacting their personal, social, and academic life. However, violent events on campuses may aggravate student stress, due to the induced fear and trauma. In this paper, leveraging social media as a passive sensor of stress, we propose novel computational techniques to quantify and examine stress responses after gun violence on college campuses. We first present a machine learning classifier for inferring stress expression in Reddit posts, which achieves an accuracy of 82%. Next, focusing on 12 incidents of campus gun violence in the past five years, and social media data gathered from college Reddit communities, our methods reveal amplified stress levels following the violent incidents, which deviate from usual stress patterns on the campuses. Further, distinctive temporal and linguistic changes characterize the campus populations, such as reduced cognition, higher self pre-occupation and death-related conversations. We discuss the implications of our work in improving mental wellbeing and rehabilitation efforts around crisis events in college student populations.",

      "abstract": "User-generated content is central to social computing scholarship. However, researchers and practitioners often presume that these users are alive. Failing to account for mortality is problematic in social media where an increasing number of profiles represent those who have died. Identifying mortality can empower designers to better manage content and support the bereaved, as well as promote high-quality data science. Based on a computational linguistic analysis of post-mortem social media profiles and content, we report on classifiers developed to detect mortality and show that mortality can be determined after the first few occurrences of post-mortem content. Applying our classifiers to content from two other platforms also provided good results. Finally, we discuss trade-offs between models that emphasize pre- vs. post-mortem precision in this sensitive context. These results mark a first step toward identifying mortality at scale, and show how designers and scientists can attend to mortality in their work.",

      "abstract": "Although accessibility in academic and professional workplaces is a well-known issue, understanding how teams with different abilities communicate and coordinate in technology-rich workspaces is less well understood. When hearing people collaborate around computers, they rely on the ability to simultaneously see and hear as they start a shared document, talk to each other while editing, and gesture towards the screen. This interaction norm breaks down for teams of people with different sensory abilities, such as Deaf and hearing collaborators, who rely on visual communication. Through interviews and observations, we analyze how Deaf-hearing teams collaborate on a variety of naturalistic tasks. Our findings reveal that Deaf-hearing teams create accessibility through their moment-to-moment co-located interaction and emerging team practices over time. We conclude with a discussion of how studying co-located Deaf-hearing interaction extends our understanding of accessibility in mixed-ability teams and provides new insights for groupware systems.",

      "abstract": "Prior research on technology use in the Global South suggests that people in marginalized communities frequently share a single device among multiple individuals. However, the data privacy challenges and tensions that arise when people share devices have not been studied in depth. This paper presents a qualitative study with 72 participants that analyzes how families in Bangladesh currently share mobile phones, their usage patterns, and the tensions and challenges that arise as individuals seek to protect the privacy of their personal data. We show how people share devices out of economic need, but also because sharing is a social and cultural practice that is deeply embedded in Bangladeshi society. We also discuss how prevalent power relationships affect sharing practices and reveal gender dynamics that impact the privacy of women's data. Finally, we highlight strategies that participants adopted to protect their private data from the people with whom they share devices. Taken together, our findings have broad implications that advance the CSCW community's understanding of digital privacy outside the Western world.",

Yet, little is known about how social technologies impact the day-to-day work of entrepreneurs in resource-constrained contexts. We performed a qualitative study involving interviews with 26 micro-entrepreneurs in Detroit and observations of entrepreneurship events. We found that micro-entrepreneurs in Detroit are often pushed into entrepreneurship in response to unexpected life disruptions, barriers to employment, and desire to benefit the community. Their resource-constrained contexts shape how they use social technologies, such as sharing economy tools and social media groups, particularly with respect to privacy, safety, and professional agency. We expand the discussion in CSCW around what it means to be an entrepreneur and provide implications for how social technologies can be designed to better meet the employment needs of people in resource-constrained communities.",

We conducted participant observation for 120 hours and 58 semi-structured interviews with different stakeholders (including teachers, staff, parents, and students) at the center over nine weeks from December 2015 to July 2016. Taking an assets-based approach in an underserved context, we uncover the role of care as a resource and present the rich and varied caring behaviors enacted in this sociotechnical system. We then discuss how care effects a greater sense of ownership, interdependency, and community. Examining the role of aligning values in motivating caring behavior, we conclude with recommendations for supporting, leveraging, and extending care via technology design in an underserved, technology-enhanced learning environment.",

However, such code-switching makes others feel excluded and thus not considered appropriate during formal meetings. To offer NNSs more flexibility to code-switch in a group discussion while minimizing the cost of excluding others, we introduced a language support tool that automatically detects between two pre-defined spoken languages, and then transcribe as well as translate them into another language (common language or NNS’s native language). In a within-subject study involving 19 quads (two Japanese and two Chinese) in a collocated setting, participants were asked to perform a series of decision-making tasks with and without the tool. Results showed that the language support tool encouraged diverse use of language during a meeting, resulting in more equal participation from each group member. Although the perceived quality of collaboration became lower, it also elicited helping behaviors among the NNS pairs.",

Various models of hierarchical governance have been established and managed in different online venues, with both successes and failures. Recently, a new model of non-hierarchical governance has emerged using crowdsourcing technology to allow an online community to manage itself. How do people view and work with non-hierarchical governance? In this paper, we present an interview study with people from two sites: the video game League of Legends and Weibo, a microblogging site in China. We found that people were passionate about participation in crowdsourcing, but at the same time, struggled with the system, and acted beyond their designated role within the system. We derive implications for designing online non-hierarchical governance from our research. ",

      "abstract": "We have created and evaluated a novel mobile messaging app named Curtains Messenger. The app has been designed to support synchrony in messaging. It does this by requiring users to be in the app at the same time as each other in order to send, receive and read messages. This design is contrary to typical apps where messages can be sent and read asynchronously at an individual's convenience. We have conducted a field trial in which 15 users installed the app on their own devices and used it in the wild. We present a qualitative analysis of interviews with the participants following the trial. The findings address how the app was used, how synchrony affected conversational flows, how synchrony raised issues of attention and intimacy, and what issues users faced in the practical work of conducting synchronous messaging. This work demonstrates how core concepts in the study of cooperative work such as a/synchrony can be drawn upon to reconsider taken-for-granted design features of mobile applications and the lived experience of communication.",

While participants compete for prizes in these contests, over half of contests conducted on online platforms allow participants to share ideas during contests, for benefits such as individual learning, community building, and cumulative innovation. Such sharing, however, is at tension with the competitive nature of crowd contests. To understand this tension, this study investigates community-level sharing of code on Kaggle, a contest platform for predictive modeling. Analyzing data on 25 contests in 2015 and 2016, we find that 10% of users shared code during contests, that participants doing medium well in the contest were the most likely to share code, and that sharing code improved individual, but not collective performance. These findings allow us to contribute insights about the participants, conditions, process, and outcomes of community-level collaboration to both research on and design of open innovation contests.",

      "abstract": "Menstruation has long remained a conversational taboo across India, resulting in inadequate dissemination of menstrual health education (MHE). Menstrupedia, a digital platform designed for an Indian audience, aims to bridge this information gap to impart MHE via its website and comic. We contribute a study of Menstrupedia---the information exchange on its website, the education it aims to provide, and the perceptions of its users. Using a combination of qualitative research methods, and engaging a feminist Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) lens, we critically analyze Menstrupedia's affordances and shortcomings. We also make recommendations for the design of technology-based dissemination of MHE, as well as additional sensitive and taboo topics.",

      "abstract": "Community policing to collaboratively maintain community safety and order in conjunction with law enforcement is becoming increasingly popular and efficient with the use of mobile technologies. Beyond sharing information about local problems such as crime via online discussion forums, there has been an increased focus on the impact of mobile, location-based systems on community policing. In this study, we designed a novel communitysourced patrolling campaign in which community members schedule their own patrol times and routes, then perform location-based patrolling with video capturing and sharing using their smartphones. We conducted a four-week field study (n=20) on a university campus to verify the campaign's feasibility and observe users' behavior. Our results show key findings about users' task scheduling, event capturing and reporting behaviors, factors affecting task selection and execution, and user motivation and engagement. Finally, we discuss several practical design implications in building location-based systems for communitysourced patrolling.",

      "abstract": "Approximately 8 million U.S. children have at least one immigrant parent. Lower-socioeconomic (SES) immigrant parents often rely on their children’s language skills to problem-solve family needs—a practice known as brokering. Yet it is unknown how children use their language and digital literacy skills to search and broker information online. This paper examines how children with lower-SES immigrant parents search and broker information online. We focused on Latino families as they are the fastest growing U.S. minority group. We conducted in-home interviews and observations of search tasks with 23 parent-child dyads. We demonstrate: (1) how Online Search and Brokering (OSB) is impacted by familial values and resources at an individual, family, community, and digital infrastructure level, and (2) through search vignettes, how parent-child dyads problem-solve family needs through OSB. Our work demonstrates a different purpose of technology use in families: intergenerational, bilingual, and online co-searching to problem-solve family needs.",

      "abstract": "Mobile videochat use has been growing, especially for teens. To better understand teens’ videochat practices, we conducted a two-week photo diary study with 16 teens. We found that most often, teens videochat with their closest friends from their bedrooms when they feel lonely or bored. Teens turned to videochat when understimulated but also felt understimulated during videochat. In order to manage this, they multitasked – teens moved from active chatting to co-presence while engaged in separate activities like scrolling social feeds or playing games. We uncovered social norms of reciprocity of attention, where teens match the attention level of the other and give leeway to briefly divert attention. Digital notifications did not feel disruptive to the videochat but family members’ interruptions felt disruptive as teens’ domestic context intruded into their virtual peer setting. We discuss these findings and their implications for research and design of videochat systems.",

      "abstract": "Self-disclosure of stigmatized conditions is known to yield therapeutic benefits. Social media sites are emerging as promising platforms enabling disclosure around a variety of stigmatized concerns, including mental illness. What kind of behavioral changes precede and follow such disclosures? Do the therapeutic benefits of ``opening up'' manifest in these changes? In this paper, we address these questions by focusing on disclosures of schizophrenia diagnoses made on Twitter. We adopt a clinically grounded quantitative approach to first identify temporal phases around disclosure during which symptoms of schizophrenia are likely to be significant. Then, to quantify behaviors before and after disclosures, we define linguistic measures drawing from literature on psycholinguistics and the socio-cognitive model of schizophrenia. Along with significant linguistic differences before and after disclosures, we find indications of therapeutic outcomes following disclosures, including improved readability and coherence in language, future orientation, lower self preoccupation, and reduced discussion of symptoms and stigma perceptions. We discuss the implications of social media as a new  therapeutic tool in supporting disclosures of stigmatized conditions.",

      "abstract": "Global virtual teams experience intercultural conflict. Yet, research on how Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) tools can mitigate such conflict is minimal. We conducted an experiment with 30 Japanese-Canadian dyads who completed a negotiation task over email. Dyads were assigned to one of three conditions: C1) no feedback; C2) automated language feedback of participant emails based on national culture dimensions; and C3) automated language feedback (as in C2), and participants’ shared self-reflections of that feedback. Results show Japanese and Canadian partners interpreted the negotiation task differently, resulting in perceptions of intercultural conflict and negative impressions of their partner. Compared to C1, automated language feedback (C2) and shared self-reflections (C3) made cultural differences more salient, motivating participants to empathize with their partner. Shared self-reflections (C3) served as a meta-channel to communication, providing insight into each partner’s intentions and cultural values. We discuss implications for CMC tools to mitigate perceptions of intercultural conflict.",

Motivated by the need for accessible online spaces for people experiencing vision impairment in older adulthood, we developed xPress, a voice-based online blogging community. Through a 10-week deployment with seven older adults with acquired vision loss, we analyze how this type of online community enables connecting with peers, sharing experiences, and offering social support in new ways. The design of xPress also highlights the importance of human voice in accessible social platforms and reveals expectations around community participation. We discuss designing for age and disability through the lens of intersectionality and offer design considerations for similar voice-based online communities.",

      "abstract": "Crowdsourcing more complex and creative tasks is seen as a desirable goal for both employers and workers, but these tasks traditionally require domain expertise. Employers can recruit only expert workers, but this approach does not scale well. Alternatively, employers can decompose complex tasks into simpler microtasks, but some domains, such as historical analysis, cannot be easily modularized in this way. A third approach is to train workers to learn the domain expertise. This approach offers clear benefits to workers, but is perceived as costly or infeasible for employers. In this paper, we present CrowdSCIM, a workflow that teaches domain expertise (historical thinking skills) to novice crowd workers. We compare CrowdSCIM with two crowd learning techniques from prior work and a baseline to explore the trade-offs between learning and productivity. Our evaluation (n=360) shows that CrowdSCIM allows workers to learn domain expertise while producing work of equal or higher quality versus other conditions, but efficiency is slightly lower.",

      "abstract": "Stickers, though similar in appearance to emoji, have distinct characteristics because they often contain animation, diverse gestures, and multiple characters and objects. Stickers can convey richer meaning than emoji, but their complexity and placement constraint may result in miscommunication. In this paper, we aim to understand how people perceive emotion in stickers, as well as how miscommunication related to sticker occurs in actual chat contexts. Toward this goal, we conducted an online survey (n = 87) and in-depth interviews (n = 28) in South Korea. We found emotional and contextual aspects of sticker misinterpretation. In particular, emotion misinterpretation mostly happened due to stickers' ambiguous (multiple) facial/bodily expressions and different perception of dynamism in gestures. In real chat settings, there were also contextual misinterpretations where senders and receivers differently interpret stickers' visual representation/reference, or/and corresponding textual messages. Based on these findings, we provide several practical design implications such as context awareness support in sticker interaction.",

We qualitatively analyzed patient-generated content in an online health community dedicated to fertility. We found five distinct types of engagement with data: positive, burdened, obsessive, trapped, and abandoning. Each of them is composed of an action and an emotional component that mutually influence each other. We discuss how the interplay of these components characterize a person’s engagement with data, how the online forum made these issues visible, and how they are embedded in the self-tracking culture. We also provide insights into the implications of these issues for self-tracking tools. Finally, we hypothesize how people transition through the types of relationships with data, suggesting directions for future research in the area. ",

      "abstract": "Online harassment is a complex and growing problem. On Twitter, one mechanism people use to avoid harassment is the blocklist, a list of accounts that are preemptively blocked from interacting with a subscriber. In this article, we present a rich description of Twitter blocklists – why they are needed, how they work, and their strengths and weaknesses in practice. Next, we use blocklists to interrogate online harassment – the forms it takes, as well as tactics used by harassers. Specifically, we interviewed both people who use blocklists to protect themselves, and people who are blocked by blocklists. We find that users are not adequately protected from harassment, and at the same time, many people feel that they are blocked unnecessarily and unfairly. Moreover, we find that not all users agree on what constitutes harassment. Based on our findings, we propose design interventions for social network sites with the aim of protecting people from harassment, while preserving freedom of speech.",

      "abstract": "Traditional employment usually provides mechanisms for workers to improve their skills to access better opportunities. However, crowd work platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) generally do not support skill development (i.e., becoming faster and better at work). While researchers have started to tackle this problem, most solutions are dependent on experts or requesters willing to help. However, requesters generally lack the necessary knowledge, and experts are rare and expensive. To further facilitate crowd workers' skill growth, we present Crowd Coach, a system that enables workers to receive peer coaching while on the job. We conduct a field experiment and real world deployment to study Crowd Coach in the wild. Hundreds of workers used Crowd Coach in a variety of tasks, including writing, doing surveys, and labeling images. We find that Crowd Coach enhances workers' speed without sacrificing their work quality, especially in audio transcription tasks. We posit that peer coaching systems hold potential for better supporting crowd workers' skill development while on the job. We finish with design implications from our research.",

      "abstract": "While group chat is becoming increasingly popular for team collaboration, these systems generate long streams of unstructured back-and-forth discussion that are difficult to comprehend. In this work, we investigate ways to enrich the representation of chat conversations, using techniques such as tagging and summarization, to enable users to better make sense of chat. Through needfinding interviews with 15 active group chat users, who were shown mock-up alternative chat designs, we found the importance of structured representations, including signals such as discourse acts. We then developed Tilda, a prototype system that enables people to collaboratively enrich their chat conversation while conversing. From lab evaluations, we examined the ease of marking up chat using Tilda as well as the effectiveness of Tilda-enabled summaries for getting an overview. From a field deployment, we found that teams actively engaged with Tilda both for marking up their chat as well as catching up on chat.",

Based on these interviews we propose that, compared to Couchsurfing, Airbnb: (1) appears to require higher quality services, (2) places more emphasis on places over people, and (3) shifts social power from hosts to guests. Using public profiles from both platforms, we present analyses exploring each theme. Finally, we present evidence showing that Airbnb's growth has coincided with a decline in Couchsurfing.

      "abstract": "Community edits to questions and answers (called post edits) plays an important role in improving content quality in Stack Overflow. Our study of post edits in Stack Overflow shows that a large number of edits are about formatting, grammar and spelling. These post edits usually involve small-scale sentence edits and our survey of trusted contributors suggests that most of them care much or very much about such small sentence edits. To assist users in making small sentence edits, we develop an edit-assistance tool for identifying minor textual issues in posts and recommending sentence edits for correction. We formulate the sentence editing task as a machine translation problem, in which an original sentence is ``translated'' into an edited sentence. Our tool implements a character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder-decoder model, trained with about 6.8 millions original-edited sentence pairs from Stack Overflow post edits. We evaluate our edit assistance tool using a large-scale archival post edits, a field study of assisting a novice post editor, and a survey of trusted contributors. Our evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of training a deep learning model with post edits by the community and then using the trained model to assist post editing for the community.",

      "abstract": "People are increasingly sharing information on social media during disaster events. This information could be valuable to emergency responders, but there remain challenges for using it to inform response efforts---including filtering relevant information from the large volumes of noise. Previous research has largely focused on identifying information that can contribute to a generalized concept of situational awareness. Our work explores the value of approaching this problem from a different perspective---one of actionability---with the idea that information relevance may vary across responder role, domain, and other factors. This approach asks how we can get the right information to the right person at the right time. We interviewed and surveyed diverse responders to understand what ``actionable'' information is, allowing that actionability might differ from one responder to another. Through the findings, we (1) offer a nuanced understanding of actionability such that it complements existing approaches based on situational awareness; (2) describe responders' perspective of what distinguishes good information when making rapid judgments; and (3) suggest opportunities for augmenting social media use to highlight information that needs immediate attention. We offer researchers an opportunity to frame different models of actionability to suit the requirements of a responding role.",

Like many citizen science projects, volunteer retention is a key measure of engagement and data quality. Through survival analysis, we found that participant age (self-reported at account creation) is a significant predictor of retention. Compared to all other age groups, participants aged 60-70 are much more likely to sign up for CoCoRaHS, and to remain active for several years. We also measured the influence of task difficulty and the relative frequency of rain, finding small but statistically significant and counterintuitive effects. Finally, we confirmed previous work showing that participation levels within the first month are highly predictive of eventual retention.

      "abstract": "Social capital is one of the most fundamental concepts in social computing. Individual so-cial capital is often connected with one’s happiness levels, well-being, and propensity to cooperate with others. The dominant approach for quantifying individual social capital remains self-reported surveys and generator-methods, which are costly, attention-consuming, and fraught with biases. Given the important role played by mobile phones in mediating human social lives, this study explores the use of phone metadata (call and SMS logs) to automatically infer an individual’s social capital. Based on Williams’ Social Capital survey as ground truth and ten-week phone data collection for 55 participants, we report that (1) multiple phone-based social features are intrinsically associated with social capital; and (2) analytics algorithms utilizing phone data can achieve high accuracy at automatically inferring an individual’s bridging, bonding, and overall social capital scores. Results pave way for studying social capital and its temporal dynamics at an unprecedented scale.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Despite being considered a fundamental issue in the design, use, and appropriation of digital technologies, IT security has found but little attention in CSCW so far. Approaches in Human-Computer Interaction and Software Engineering do not account appropriately for the weave of dispersed practices that it takes to ‘do’ IT security---practices that involve a heterogeneous set of actors and unfold at diverse sites and across organizational, legal, and professional boundaries. In this paper we propose to conceive of IT security through the lens of care, a notion that we draw from Science and Technology Studies. Caring for IT security requires continuous, often invisible work that relies upon tinkering and experimentation and addresses perennial oscillations between in-/securities. Caring for IT security, then, engages with established accountabilities and cultivates a moral stance that refrains from blaming insecurities upon single actors. We conclude with outlining a caring approach to IT security for CSCW.",

      "abstract": "Exploiting evidence that sporting results affect fans’ mood, we analyze whether National Football League game outcomes can affect the contributions of Wikipedia editors who identify as fans of a specific team. We find that the day after a team loses, their fans decrease their contributions towards football-related pages (relative to after a win). Relative decreases are bigger if losses are unexpected, or if losing margins are big. In contrast, unexpected wins do not cause more contributions relative to wins that were not unexpected. Neither do big wins result in more contributions relative to small wins. Additionally, contributions to non-football-related pages are not affected by NFL game results. Our findings add to the literatures on (i) the determinants of individual contributions to peer production communities, (ii) how community dynamics affect user contributions, (iii) the importance of emotions, (iv) the effect of offline events on online behavior, and (v) the applicability of behavioral economics concepts to the HCI literature.",

      "abstract": "Invisible work is an important CSCW research agenda, and also integral to operations within companies. To reveal these hidden practices, studies to date have suggested that companies use IT systems to share location, task progress, and enquiry information among employees, or to conduct research work which identifies informal practices. In this paper, we examine a work review system, in the form of a smartphone app feature, to identify hidden employees’ contributions. This Complimenting Feature, developed in April 2017 by an air cargo handling company in Hong Kong, allows its terminal staff to compliment other employees—anyone they like, and anytime they like. In December 2017, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 terminal staff regarding their experiences using the app. Our analysis of the interviews found a wide range of invisible work being identified despite the existence of a similar paper review form. We have also found evidence of increased employees’ motivation and social learning.",

      "abstract": "Video telehealth is growing to allow more clinicians to see patients from afar. As a result, clinicians, typically trained for in-person visits, must learn to communicate both health information and non-verbal affective signals to patients through a digital medium. We introduce a system called ReflectLive that senses and provides real-time feedback about non-verbal communication behaviors to clinicians so they can improve their communication behaviors. A user evaluation with 10 clinicians showed that the real-time feedback helped clinicians maintain better eye contact with patients and was not overly distracting. Clinicians reported being more aware of their non-verbal communication behaviors and reacted positively to summaries of their conversational metrics, motivating them to want to improve. Using ReflectLive as a probe, we also discuss the benefits and concerns around automatically quantifying the “soft skills” and complexities of clinician-patient communication, the controllability of behaviors, and the design considerations for how to present real-time and summative feedback to clinicians.",

Diba’s political activism can be characterized as negotiating a tension between two seemingly opposed goals. On the one hand is their construction of a pro-PRC message using the tactics of Internet subcultures (memes, trolling, etc.), but toned down to meet standards of civility. On the other hand, by collectively breaching the Great Firewall and establishing Facebook accounts, the group transgressed PRC technical and legal norms, which were designed to prevent unsanctioned collective action. We argue that the Diba Expedition exemplifies the coordinated use of a complex, transnational social media ecology to support and produce a mass-scale event and newsworthy spectacle, loosened if not severed from state control, and a discursively innovative polysemous message targeted at diverse international audiences: civilized trolling.",

Our study focuses on recurring meetings, both because recurring meetings are an ordinary aspect of organization life, and because their routine nature lends them a casual character that distinguishes them from one-time, issue-focused meetings. This paper analyzes accounts of 19 meetings and examines how various peripheral activities – side-talk, side-tracking, multi-tasking, pre- and post-meeting talk – have positive effects, as well as negative ones. We argue that viewing recurring meetings as a confluence of individual and collective aims suggests new approaches for designing technology that supports both meetings and participants.",

Yet how organizations apply anonymization techniques to data remains under-explored. We investigate how such measures are applied in organizations through a small-scale interview study, asking whether anonymization practices are used, what approaches are considered practical and adequate, and how decisions are made to protect the privacy of data subjects while preserving analytical value. Our findings suggest that applying anonymization is a complex socio-technical process and it is less common than we had originally expected. Organizations that employ anonymization often view their practices as sensitive and resort to anonymity by obscurity alongside technical means. Rather than being a purely technical question of applying the right algorithms, anonymization in practice relies on multi-stakeholder collaborations across organizational boundaries. Here we observe engagement of what Suchman has called \"multiple, located, partial perspectives\" in ongoing discussions necessary to negotiate the technical as well as organizational complexities of implementing data anonymization.",

      "abstract": "Cross-sectional research suggests that online risk exposure (e.g., cyberbullying, sexual solicitations, and explicit content) may negatively impact teens, increasing concerns over the risks teens are exposed to online. Yet, there has been little research as to how these experiences impact teens’ mood over time, or how long these effects may last. To examine the effects of online risk exposure on mood, we asked 68 teens to report their weekly online risk experiences, emotions, and sense of well-being for two months. We found that teens experienced more negative emotions the week that they reported cyberbullying and exposure to explicit content, but these effects were gone one week later. In addition, teens reported a slight in crease in positive emotions and mental well-being during weeks they were exposed to other risks. Our results suggest that most of the risks teens in our study experienced online only pose brief negative effects, if any, and initiates a discussion on how our society may overly problematize the negative effects of online risk exposure on teens.",

      "abstract": "Bots, or programs designed to engage in social spaces and perform automated tasks, are typically understood as automated tools or as social \"chatbots.\" In this paper, we consider bots' place alongside users within diverse communities in the emerging social ecosystem of audience participation platforms, guided by concepts from structural role theory. We perform a large-scale analysis of bot activity levels on Twitch, finding that they communicate at a much greater rate than other types of users. We build on prior literature on bot functionalities to identify the roles bots play on Twitch, how these roles vary across different types of Twitch communities, and how users engage with them and vice versa. We conclude with a discussion of where opportunities lie to re-conceptualize and re-design bots as social actors who help communities grow and evolve.",

      "abstract": "Today, social media provide the means by which billions of people experience news and events happening around the world. However, the absence of traditional journalistic gatekeeping allows information to flow unencumbered through these platforms, often raising questions of veracity and credibility of the reported information. Here we ask: How do the dynamics of collective attention directed toward an event reported on social media vary with its perceived credibility? By examining the first large-scale, systematically tracked credibility database of public Twitter messages (47M messages corresponding to 1,138 real-world events over a period of three months), we established a relationship between the temporal dynamics of events reported on social media and their associated level of credibility judgments. Representing collective attention by the aggregate temporal signatures of an event's reportage, we found that the amount of continued attention focused on an event provides information about its associated levels of perceived credibility. Events exhibiting sustained, intermittent bursts of attention were found to be associated with lower levels of perceived credibility. In other words, as more people showed interest during moments of transient collective attention, the associated uncertainty surrounding these events also increased.",

      "abstract": "Many couples are in long distance relationships due to a variety of reasons ranging from work opportunities to family obligations. However, current computer-mediated communication tools are not designed to support the entire range of communication behaviors that long distance couples engage in during daily life. Our research explored how telepresence robots might fit into the array of tools that long distance couples use to communicate, given the factors of mobility and physicality that could support acts of interactivity and autonomy between partners. We found that telepresence robot communication facilitated interactions in five areas: participation in mundane everyday routines, feelings of sharing a home, connection with one’s partner’s family and friends, increased helpfulness, and the enjoyment of quiet companionship. However, telepresence robots also presented challenges related to privacy and asymmetry, as well as continued deficiencies in the level of interactivity. In response to these findings, we discuss design opportunities for telepresence robots.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we present ReactionBot, a system that attaches emoji based on users’ facial expressions to text messages on Slack. Through a study of 16 dyads, we found that ReactionBot was able to help communicate participants’ affect, reducing the need for participants to self-react with emoji during conversations. However, contrary to our hypothesis, ReactionBot reduced social presence (behavioral interdependence) between dyads. Post study interviews suggest that the emotion feedback through ReactionBot indeed provided valuable nonverbal cues: offered more genuine feedback, and participants were more aware of their own emotions. However, this can come at the cost of increasing anxiety from concerns about negative emotion leakage. Further, the more active role of the system in facilitating the conversation can also result in unwanted distractions and may have attributed to the reduced sense of behavioral interdependence. We discuss implications for utilizing this type of cues in text-based communication.",

      "abstract": "The goal of this workshop is to bring together CSCW audiences who engage in studies and interventions related to care work. Our aims are to understand how care has been conceptualized in the extant CSCW community, identify core issues and concerns, and formalize how CSCW concepts could be used as a lens to inquire into this domain. This workshop will be devoted to understanding how notions of “care” shape the methods, contexts, and practices of CSCW researchers. By shifting focus from care (a term that often connotes particular contexts for research) to care-ing (practices that involve care), we will trace patterns across multiple genres of research: from those that we typically associate with care-work (e.g., healthcare, eldercare, childcare) to those in which care motivates research objectives (e.g., social justice, sustainability) and perspectives (e.g. postanthrocentrism, feminism). This shift brings with it an expanded notion of how we might understand and design with care by framing care as a term that congeals certain sets of practices and orientations to the subjects of research. The aim of this workshop is to bring multiple practitioners to question how CSCW researchers practice and can practice “caring” within multiple realms of research. For instance, how might insights from studies of caregiving in healthcare settings apply to research involving care for the environment? How can care shape how our research is practiced and presented? How might care force us to confront and motivate action in areas for which we have long been concerned? How can we broaden our understanding of care labor and caring beyond medicalized and formalized understandings of care? As interpersonal and community interactions are increasingly facilitated through the technologies we design, how can we ensure that these often-tacit interactions are still able to take place? How might we be able to improve their efficacy?",

Our interest in understanding politeness in an online community focused our attention on tools that would help automate politeness analysis. This paper highlights one popular classification tool designed to score the politeness of text. Our application of this tool to Wikipedia data yielded some unexpected results. Those unexpected results led us to question how the tool worked and its effectiveness relative to human judgment and classification. We designed a user study to revalidate the tool with crowdworkers labeling samples of content from Wikipedia talk pages, imitating the original efforts to validate the tool. This revalidation points to challenges for automatic labeling. Based on our results, this paper reconsiders politeness in online communities as well as broader trends in the use of machine classifiers in social computing research.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes the design and development of a preliminary qualitative coding tool as well as a method to improve the process of achieving inter-coder reliability (ICR) in small teams. Software applications that support qualitative coding do not sufficiently assist collaboration among coders and overlook some fundamental issues related to ICR. We propose a new dimension of collaborative coding called “coders’ certainty” and demonstrate its ability to illustrate valuable code disagreements that are missing from existing approaches. Through a case study, we describe the utility of our tool, Code Wizard, and how it helped a group of researchers effectively collaborate to code naturalistic observation data. We report the valuable lessons we learned from the development of our tool and method: (1) identifying coders’ certainty constitutes an important part of determining the quality of data analysis and facilitates identifying overlapping and ambiguous codes, (2) making the details of coding process visible helps streamline the coding process and leads to a sense of ownership of the research results, and (3) there is valuable information hidden in coding disagreements that can be leveraged for improving the process of data analysis.",

      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "For years, the CSCW community has sought to improve collocated large events — such as conferences, seminars, classes, festivals — through allowing spectators to participate in the creation of content for the event.  These tools often called backchannels or audience interaction systems, have provided the audience with a mediated channel to support their participation. Previous work has shown that these technologies redistribute agency and power in events and allow for new forms of communication to emerge. However, the focus in the research of these tools has often been only in mediated communication only or researchers have exhibited a separation of physical and digital interaction. This workshops invites researchers to revisit this distinction. Instead of analyzing mediated communication separate from the event, we call for analysis of hybrid events, highlighting changes in the communication channels, user roles and event design brought by the technology. Beyond a scientific motive to improve conceptual tools to study this phenomena, this workshop addresses changes in the technology landscape that has made audience participation easier. Compared with the previous research, today the pervasiveness of smart devices have made it simple and easy to integrate audience participation tools into events, and therefore, allow audience participation. As a result, several commercial services now exist allowing event organizers to rapidly and easily take these kinds of tools into use. This development demands a change in the research focus: instead of showing that this can be done, the research can now study emerging uses of these technologies not aided by the researchers. This means that the research should be moving from research prototypes to research product. To support academics in this transition, we believe that future research on this area must reflect aspects such as the emerging social practices or it should focus on improving socio-technical designs of existing systems. To direct the research towards these areas, this workshop seeks to develop a research agenda with conceptual frameworks and research strategies which together will direct academic studies further.",

      "abstract": "Open online communities rely on social norms for behavior regulation, group cohesion, and sustainability. Research on the role of social norms online has mainly focused on one source of influence at a time, making it difficult to separate different normative influences and understand their interactions. In this study, we use the Focus Theory to examine interactions between several sources of normative influence in a Wikipedia sub-community: local descriptive norms, local injunctive norms, and norms imported from similar sub-communities. We find that exposure to injunctive norms has a stronger effect than descriptive norms, that the likelihood of performing a behavior is higher when both injunctive and descriptive norms are congruent, and that conflicting social norms may negatively impact pro-normative behavior. We contextualize these findings through member interviews, and discuss their implications for both future research on normative influence in online groups and the design of systems that support open collaboration.",

      "abstract": "Crowdsourced classification of data typically assumes that objects can be unambiguously classified into categories. In practice, many classification tasks are ambiguous due to various forms of disagreement. Prior work shows that exchanging verbal justifications can significantly improve answer accuracy over aggregation techniques. In this work, we study how worker deliberation affects resolvability and accuracy using case studies with both an objective and a subjective task. Results show that case resolvability depends on various factors, including the level and reasons for the initial disagreement, as well as the amount and quality of deliberation activities. Our work reinforces the finding that deliberation can increase answer accuracy and the importance of verbal discussion in this process. We contribute a new public data set on worker deliberation for text classification tasks, and discuss considerations for the design of deliberation workflows for classification.",

      "abstract": "Drawing from fieldwork of 13 small food farms in the Midwestern U.S., we describe the on-the-ground, practical challenges of doing and communicating sustainability when local food production is not well-supported. We illustrate how farmers enact learned and honed tactics of sustainability at key sites such as farmers' markets and the Internet with consumers. These tactics reveal tensions with dominant discourse from government, Big Ag, and popular culture. The success of these tactics depends on farmers having fortitude--control, resilience, and the wherewithal to be exemplars of sustainability. In our discussion, we highlight how the local farmers' social movement work constitutes loosely organized small groups connecting others to an amorphous idea of a sustainable society--one that sustains an environmental, economic, local, cultural, and physical way of life. Using Fine’s concept of tiny publics, we identify design opportunities for supporting this less directed kind of social movement.",

      "abstract": "StackExchange is a network of Question & Answer (Q&A) sites that support collaborative knowledge exchange on a variety of topics. Prior research found a significant imbalance between those who contribute content to Q&A sites (predominantly people from Western countries) and those who passively use the site (the so-called \"lurkers\"). One possible explanation for such participation differences between countries could be a mismatch between culturally related preferences of some users and the values ingrained in the design of the site. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted a value-sensitive analysis of the design of the StackExchange site Stack Overflow and contrasted our findings with those of participants from societies with varying cultural backgrounds using a series of focus groups and interviews. Our results reveal tensions between collectivist values, such as the openness for social interactions, and the performance-oriented, individualist values embedded in Stack Overflow's design and community guidelines. This finding confirms that socio-technical sites like Stack Overflow reflect the inherent values of their designers, knowledge that can be leveraged to foster participation equity.",

      "abstract": "Support from family members is an important determinant of health. In this work, we probe opportunities for facilitating family support with TableChat, a chat-based mobile application for food journaling. Leveraging food as a test case of family support, TableChat virtually extends the experience of bonding over the dinner table. We surveyed 158 people about their existing family support practices and deployed TableChat with 10 families in the field. We found that tangible support was the most common form of support shared in TableChat and also the most appreciated by participants. However, we found that participants valued not only supportive actions taken by their family members, but also those deliberately not taken (e.g., not buying junk food). Finally, families reported that journaling meals eaten apart aided the exchange of support, satisfied curiosity, and provided a “check-in” that everything was alright, whereas journaling meals eaten together felt redundant. We conclude with a framework that illustrates how informatics tools can be designed to complement rather than compete with existing family interactions.",

In this paper, we present a qualitative investigation of the introduction of Uber in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Using interview data from drivers and riders, and content analysis of riders' Facebook posts, we highlight how Uber's introduction into Dhaka's existing transportation infrastructure influenced experiences and practices of mobility in the city. Drawing on Iris Marion Young's theory of justice, we demonstrate how the introduction of Uber in Dhaka reinforces existing modes of oppression and introduces new ones, even as it generates room for creative modes of resistance. Finally, we underline algorithms' opacity and veneer of objectivity as a potential source of oppression, call for deepening the postcolonial computing perspective, and make a case for stronger connections between technology interventions and policy.",

      "abstract": "Most commonly used approaches to developing automated or artificially intelligent algorithmic systems are Big Data-driven and machine learning-based. However, these approaches can fail, for two notable reasons: (1) they may lack critical engagement with users and other stakeholders; (2) they rely largely on historical human judgments, which do not capture and incorporate human insights into how the world can be improved in the future. We propose and describe a novel method for the design of such algorithms, which we call Value Sensitive Algorithm Design. Value Sensitive Algorithm Design incorporates stakeholders’ tacit knowledge and explicit feedback in the early stages of algorithm creation. This increases the chance to avoid biases in design choices or to compromise key stakeholder values. Generally, we believe that algorithms should be designed to balance multiple stakeholders’ needs, motivations, and interests, and to help achieve important collective goals. We also describe a specific project “Designing Intelligent Socialization Algorithms for WikiProjects in Wikipedia” to illustrate our method. We intend this paper to contribute to the rich ongoing conversation concerning the use of algorithms in supporting critical decision-making in society.",

In doing so, we offer an enriched understanding of how various social media channels might support informal, on-the-ground, crisis response, but also where they fall short in the process. Studying the emergence of care where social media fell short allows us to make recommendations for technology design to improve the effectiveness of logisticians in crisis response. By examining the bodily engagement of our participants at crisis sites, their efforts to deal with material convergence, and how they interacted with social media for technology-mediated care, we also contribute an understanding of the sociomateriality of care that emerges amidst efforts towards crisis relief.",

      "abstract": "In CSCW and HCI, work examining expression of mental health and illness on social media frequently aims to classify content, quantify visual trends, and predict user states. This approach to analysis is a form of the coded gaze, a type of algorithmic ‘way of seeing’ coined with respect to artificial intelligence techniques. The coded gaze classifies content through researcher- and machine-labeled categories, relying on a series of theoretical assumptions that influence how values pertaining to mental health and illness become inscribed in data. In this paper, we build upon this research to support alternative methods of data interpretation. We join manual collection of Instagram posts with semi-structured interviews and digital ethnography over six months to understand how Instagram users express their experiences with mental health and illness. We argue that individuals negotiate claims to mental health and illness through visibility and signaling, the boundaries between mental health and illness are porous and blurred, and reposting and remix are a form of participation. We discuss practical and ethical implications for studying the expression of mental health and illness online.",

This paper explores the need to establish new ways of supporting deliberation and decision-making in local planning. We report a study that explores the role of data in the complex processes involved in consultation events and the broader collaborative processes surrounding them.

      "abstract": "Social media are becoming sites of information operations—activities that seek to undermine information systems and manipulate civic discourse. Through a mixed methods approach, our research extends investigations of online activism to examine the “work” of online information operations conducted on Twitter. In particular, we analyze the English-language conversation surrounding the reemergence of Omran Daqneesh (the “Aleppo Boy”) on Syrian state television, almost a year after his family’s home was bombed in an airstrike conducted by the Syrian government. We uncover: a network of clustered users that contributes to a contested and politicized information space surrounding Omran’s story; the presence of undermining narratives that serve to disrupt the mainstream media’s narrative and confuse the audience; and the techniques used when promoting, defending, or undermining narratives. In the current climate of increasing polarization in online social spaces, this work contributes an improved understanding of information operations online and of the collaborations that take shape around and through them.",

      "abstract": "Researchers have long recognized the importance of using technology to support students’ collaboration in learning and problem solving tasks. Recently, there has been a lot of research in capturing and characterizing student discourse and how they regulate each other when they perform learning tasks in pairs or in small groups. In this paper, our goal is to dive a little deeper into how students collaborate, and the learning behaviors they exhibit when working in pairs on a learning by modeling task, while also teaching a virtual agent in the Betty’s Brain system. We report the results of a quasi-experimental study, where students were divided into two groups: one group worked in pairs and the other group worked individually. The results illustrate that students in the collaborative group built more correct causal maps than those working individually, and their pre-post test results show significantly higher learning gains in the science content. A differential sequence mining algorithm applied to their action sequences captured in log files showed differences in the learning behaviors between the two groups. The differences imply that the collaborative groups were better at debugging their evolving causal maps than the students who worked individually.",

      "abstract": "To accomplish collaborative work, collaborators need to know one another’s states of work for coordination. Similarly, in situations of knowledge transfer where experts need to instruct novices by passing implicit knowledge and personal experience about the task, one challenge lies in the knowledge gap between experts and novices. Both parties need to gain an awareness of each other’s state of task knowledge for effective knowledge transfer. In this paper, we aim to investigate how online knowledge transfer is supported by a design called knowledge transparency of a shared document workspace, which allows explicitly annotating and sharing ones’ knowledge state to make it visible to their collaborators. We conducted a laboratory study to examine how knowledge transparency affects knowledge transfer among experts and novices using an image editing task over an online document. The results shed light on how to support knowledge co-construction and communication for the purpose of knowledge transfer through interface design.",

      "abstract": "In crowd-civic systems, citizens form groups and work towards shared goals, such as discovering social issues or reforming official policies. Unfortunately, many real-world systems have been unsuccessful in continually motivating large numbers of citizens to participate voluntarily, despite various approaches such as gamification and persuasion techniques. In this paper, we examine the influence of personalized messages designed to support motivation as asserted by the Self-Determination Theory (SDT). We designed a crowd-civic platform for collecting community issues with personalized motivation-supportive messages and conducted two studies: a pair-comparison experiment with 150 participants on Amazon's Mechanical Turk and a live deployment study with 120 university members. Results of the pair-comparison study indicate applicability of SDT's perspective in crowd-civic systems. While applying it in the live system surfaced several challenges, including recruiting participants without interfering with general motivations, the collected data exhibited similar promising trends.",

      "abstract": "Mediated social touch technologies aim to transmit the sense of touch between two or more physically distributed partners. Previous work in CSCW has focused mostly on vibrotactile actuation, though there is also significant recent interest in exploring a wider variety of haptic actuation modalities. In this paper, we explore Shape Memory Alloys as a novel means for constriction and heat activation. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by implementing the SqueezeBands system, which augments social gestures over videochat with haptic actuation. We describe an evaluation of the system with 57 pairs of participants, collaborating on tasks either high or low emotional salience. Our results demonstrate that SqueezeBands encourage greater and more diverse demonstrations of touch and that they may be particularly appropriate for easing mental and physical demand in high emotion tasks. We end with a discussion of the opportunities and challenges in leveraging Shape Memory Alloy actuation for mediated social touch.",

It is often difficult to reach and recruit individuals for research purposes regarding a stigmatized condition or situation. Yet, researchers in our field have recognized the importance of work in this area and have individually developed a range of strategies to reach, recruit, and work with these populations. This will be an insightful one-day workshop on Saturday, November 3rd during the CSCW 2018 Conference in New York’s Hudson River (Jersey City). The workshop will be led by a group of researchers who have worked with different stigmatized groups, and they will share their experiences and challenges throughout the workshop! We invite any student, researcher, or practitioner who is or has worked with any type of stigmatized population. The focus of the workshop is to present, discuss, and compare strategies and experiences when working with stigmatized communities in the context of the ever evolving nature of technology. The outcomes of the workshop will include an outline for an article that will summarize the strategies and practices discussed as well as highlight the approaches that have led to the best outcomes across different populations. Thus, this will be a great opportunity for participants to discuss and learn how to work better with stigmatized populations!",

In this paper, we take a group development approach that considers how the behavior\r\nof crowds change over time in anticipation and as a result of their evaluation and recognition. Towards this\r\ngoal, this paper studies the collaborative behavior of groups comprised of editors of articles that have been\r\nrecognized for their outstanding quality and given the Good Articles (GA) status and those that eventually\r\nbecome Featured Articles (FA) on Wikipedia. The results show that the collaborative behavior of GA groups\r\nradically changes just prior to their nomination. In particular, the GA groups experience increases in the\r\nlevel of activity, centralization of workload, and level of GA experience and decreases in conflict (i.e., reverts)\r\namong editors. After being promoted to GA, they converge back to their typical behavior and composition.\r\nThis indicates that crowd behavior prior to their evaluation period is dramatically different than behavior\r\nbefore or after. In addition, the collaborative behaviors of crowds during their promotion to GA are predictive\r\nof whether they are eventually promoted to FA. Our findings shed new light on the importance of time in\r\nunderstanding the relationship between crowd performance and collaborative measures such as centralization,\r\nconflict and experience.",

      "abstract": "The rapid acceleration of corporate engagement with open source projects is drawing out new ways for CSCW researchers to consider the dynamics of these projects. Research must now consider the complex ecosystems within which open source projects are situated, including issues of for-profit motivations, brokering foundations, and corporate collaboration. Localized project considerations cannot reveal broader workings of an open source ecosystem, yet much empirical work is constrained to a local context. In response, we present eight observations from our eight-year engaged field study about the changing nature of open source projects. We ground these observations through 24 research questions that serve as primers to spark research ideas in this new reality of open source projects. This paper contributes to CSCW in social and crowd computing by delivering a rich and fresh look at corporately-engaged open source projects with a call for renewed focus and research into newly emergent areas of interest.",

      "abstract": "The sharing economy has quickly become a very prominent subject of research in the broader computing literature and the in human-computer interaction (HCI) literature more specifically. When other computing research areas have experienced similarly rapid growth (e.g. human computation, eco-feedback technology), early stage literature reviews have proved useful and influential by identifying trends and gaps in the literature of interest and by providing key directions for short- and long-term future work. In this paper, we seek to provide the same benefits with respect to computing research on the sharing economy. Specifically, following the suggested approach of prior computing literature reviews, we conducted a systematic review of sharing economy articles published in the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library to investigate the state of sharing economy research in computing. We performed this review with two simultaneous foci: a broad focus toward the computing literature more generally and a narrow focus specifically on HCI literature. We collected a total of 112 sharing economy articles published between 2008 and 2017 and through our analysis of these papers, we make two core contributions: (1) an understanding of the computing community's contributions to our knowledge about the sharing economy, and specifically the role of the HCI community in these contributions (i.e. what has been done) and (2) a discussion of under-explored and unexplored aspects of the sharing economy that can serve as a partial research agenda moving forward (i.e. what is next to do).",

      "trackId": 10042,
      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Conspiracy theories are omnipresent in online discussions---whether to explain a late-breaking event that still lacks official report or to give voice to political dissent. Conspiracy theories evolve, multiply, and interconnect, further complicating efforts to limit their propagation. It is therefore crucial to develop scalable methods to examine the nature of conspiratorial discussions in online communities. What do users talk about when they discuss conspiracy theories online? What are the recurring elements in their discussions? What do these elements tell us about the way users think? This work  answers these questions by analyzing over ten years of discussions in r/conspiracy---an online community on Reddit dedicated to conspiratorial discussions. We focus on the key elements of a conspiracy theory: the conspiratorial \\textit{agents}, the \\textit{actions} they perform, and their \\textit{targets}. By computationally detecting agent--action--target triplets in conspiratorial statements, and grouping them into semantically coherent clusters, we develop a notion of \\textit{narrative-motif} to detect recurring patterns of triplets. For example, a \\textit{narrative-motif} such as \\textit{``governmental agency--controls--communications''} {appears in diverse conspiratorial statements alleging that governmental agencies control information to nefarious ends. } Thus, \\textit{narrative-motifs} expose commonalities between multiple conspiracy theories even when they refer to different events or circumstances. In the process, these representations help us understand \\textit{how} users talk about conspiracy theories and offer us a means to interpret \\textit{what} they talk about. Our approach enables a population-scale study of conspiracy theories in alternative news and social media with implications for understanding their adoption and combating their spread.",

      "abstract": "Smart speakers with voice assistants, like Amazon Echo and Google Home, provide benefits and convenience but also raise privacy concerns due to their continuously listening microphones. We studied people's reasons for and against adopting smart speakers, their privacy perceptions and concerns, and their privacy-seeking behaviors around smart speakers. We conducted a diary study and interviews with seventeen smart speaker users and interviews with seventeen non-users. We found that many non-users did not see the utility of smart speakers or did not trust speaker companies. In contrast, users express few privacy concerns, but their rationalizations indicate an incomplete understanding of privacy risks, a complicated trust relationship with speaker companies, and a reliance on the socio-technical context in which smart speakers reside. Users trade privacy for convenience with different levels of deliberation and privacy resignation. Privacy tensions arise between primary, secondary, and incidental users of smart speakers. Finally, current smart speaker privacy controls are rarely used, as they are not well-aligned with users' needs. Our findings can inform future smart speaker designs; in particular we recommend better integrating privacy controls into smart speaker interaction.",

      "trackId": 10042,
      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Recently Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) are adopting more and more data-driven approaches to their work, yet NPOs often lack appropriate tools and expertise in such data related works. To compensate, many NPOs are using a new form of collaboration, civic data hackathons, to leverage on external volunteers’ data expertise. In this paper, we sought to understand how civic data hackathons could generate impactful data analytics for NPOs’ data-driven work, and how to support collaborative data analytics during hackathons. We collected various types of data (observations, surveys, and interviews) from two civic data hackathons with 9 NPOs and over 300 data volunteers in a Midwestern city in the U.S. Our results describe the collaboration activities and the types of actionable collaborative analytics outputs generated from these activities. We also identify a unique social group (i.e., client teams), who help with preparing and coordinating the event, perform brokering activities to support the collaborative analytics through the civic data hackathons. This broker role is vital for the success of the collaboration between domain experts and data experts. Our findings contribute to the CSCW research on the collaborative work of interdisciplinary hackathons, and to a broader understanding of civic data collaborations.",

      "abstract": "We designed and developed a “crowdcasting” prototype to enable remote people to participate in a live event through a collection of live streams coming from the event. Viewers could select from a choice of streams and interact with the streamer and other viewers through text comments and heart reactions. We deployed the prototype in three live events: a Winterfest holiday festival, a local Women’s March, and the South by Southwest festival. We found that viewers actively switched among a choice of streams from the event and actively interacted with each other, especially through text comments. Streams of walking about among exhibits or city sights elicited more user interaction than streams of lectures. We observed that voluntary viewers had a wider variation in how long they viewed the event, and switched among streams less and had less interaction through text comments compared to viewers recruited through Mechanical Turk.",

While the open data movement now permits citizens to acquire governmental data relating to their communities, little to no effort is made to ensure that these datasets are accessible and interpretable by non-professionals.

Leveraging visual map-based querying, citizens can access official statistics about their community, interrogate the data, and map their own data sources to create data visualisations.

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "The dominant crowdsourcing infrastructure today is the workflow, which decomposes goals into small independent tasks. However, complex goals such as design and engineering have remained stubbornly difficult to achieve with crowdsourcing workflows. Is this due to a lack of imagination, or a more fundamental limit? This paper explores this question through in-depth case studies of 22 workers across six workflow-based crowd teams, each pursuing a complex and interdependent web development goal. We used an inductive mixed method approach to analyze behavior trace data, chat logs, survey responses and work artifacts to understand how workers enacted and adapted the crowdsourcing workflows. Our results indicate that workflows served as useful coordination artifacts, but in many cases critically inhibited crowd workers from pursuing real-time adaptations to their work plans. However, the CSCW and organizational behavior literature argues that all sufficiently complex goals require open-ended adaptation. If complex work requires adaptation but traditional static crowdsourcing workflows can't support it, our results suggest that complex work may remain a fundamental limitation of workflow-based crowdsourcing infrastructures.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Effective communication is crucial for programmers of all skill levels. However, communicating about code can be difficult, particularly in asynchronous settings where one user writes an explanation for another user to read and understand later on. Communicating about code is uniquely difficult for two reasons. First, code-related explanations are dichotomous, containing fragments of code and associated natural language descriptions that are not necessarily sequential. Second, explanations of code often involve multiple stages of modifying code in steps, but these intermediate steps are difficult to capture. This paper introduces chat.codes, a new tool for creating guided explanations about code, meant to be consumed asynchronously. chat.codes introduces three features that make it easier to communicate about code. First, it introduces deictic code references, which allow users to reference specific regions of code in parts of their explanations. Second, it tracks and summarizes code edits in-line with messages, allowing users to create explanations in stages. Third, it tracks every version of code, enabling future users to back-track to a previous version of code to reconstruct the context for code references and explanations. An evaluation showed that these features were beneficial for both instructors and students in an introductory programming course.",

The Bitbarista mediates coffee consumption through autonomous processes, presenting provenance data at the time of purchase while attempting to reduce intermediaries in the coffee trade. Through the report of interactions with and around the Bitbarista, we explore its implications for everyday life, and wider social structures and values. We conclude by offering recommendations for the design of community shared autonomous systems.",

      "abstract": "Social media sites use different labels to help users find and select news feeds. For example, Blue Feed, Red Feed, a news feed created by the Wall Street Journal, use stance labels to separate news articles with opposing political ideologies to help people explore diverse opinions. To combat the spread of fake news, Facebook has experimented with putting credibility labels on news articles to help readers decide whether the content is trustworthy. To systematically understand the effects of stance and credibility labels on online news selection and consumption, we conducted a controlled experiment to study how these labels influence the selection, perceived extremeness, and level of agreement of news articles. Results show that stance labels may intensify selective exposure - a tendency for people to look for agreeable opinions -- and make people more vulnerable to polarized opinions and fake news. We found, however, that the effect of credibility labels on reducing selective exposure and recognizing fake news is limited. Although originally designed to encourage exposure to opposite viewpoints, stance labels can make fake news articles look more trustworthy, and they may lower people's perception of the extremeness of fake news articles. Our results have important implications on the subtle effects of stance and credibility labels on online news consumption.",

Many Q&As use collaborative tagging systems to improve search and discovery while distributing the work of categorizing and organization throughout the community. Although early work on collaborative tagging questioned whether consistent categorization schemes could emerge from large groups with little to no coordination, empirical studies have found surprising coherence among users’ tags. We build on this research by testing whether coherence emerges in tag usage on Q&As, a more challenging context, focusing in particular on mismatches in the specificity of tags (basic level disagreement). We found that some users shifted toward more specific tag usage over time slightly increasing conflict, but that moderators were instrumental in helping to resolve some of this conflict. This study highlights the importance of learning and moderation in the development of coherence in collaborative tagging systems.",

Drawing on research in CSCW, critical data studies, and history and sociology of science, and six months of immersive ethnographic fieldwork with a corporate data science team, we describe four common tensions in applied data science work: (un)equivocal numbers, (counter)intuitive knowledge, (in)credible data, and (in)scrutable models. We show how organizational actors establish and re-negotiate trust under messy and uncertain analytic conditions through practices of skepticism, assessment, and credibility. Highlighting the collaborative and heterogeneous nature of real-world data science, we show how the management of trust in applied corporate data science settings depends not only on pre-processing and quantification, but also on negotiation and translation. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for data science research and practice, both within and beyond CSCW.",

      "abstract": "Organizations conduct series of face-to-face meetings aiming to improve work practices. In these meetings, participants from different backgrounds collaboratively design artifacts, such as knowledge or process maps. Such meetings are orchestrated and carried out by facilitators and the success of the meetings almost solely depends on the experience of the facilitators. Previous research has mainly focused on approaches that support facilitators and participants in the upfront planning of such events. There is however, little guidance for facilitators and participants once a meeting has started. One critical aspect – among others – is that during a meeting, the facilitator and participants need to decide for how long the iterative process of discussion and design should continue. We argue that we can provide support for such decisions based on the evolution of artifacts collaboratively created during such meetings. This paper presents a multi-level, multi-method analysis of artifacts based on experts’ observations in combination with network analytics. We study the use of automated analytics to assess the evolution of collaboratively created artifacts and to indicate maturity and established consensus of the collaborative practice. We propose a computational approach to support facilitators and participants in deciding when to stop face-to-face meetings.",

      "abstract": "Researchers studying user behaviors in online communities often conduct analyses of user interaction data recorded in system logs e.g., an edit in Wikipedia. Such analysis relies on collating interactions by a unique identifier such as a user ID. However, if users can contribute without being logged-in (i.e., anonymously) analysis of interaction data omit part of a user's experience. Problematically, anonymous traces are unlikely to be randomly distributed, so their omission can change statistical conclusions, with implications for both research and practice. To understand the impacts on conclusions of leaving out anonymous traces, we conducted an analysis of system logs from two online citizen science projects. Attributing anonymous traces with user IDs, we found that (1) many users contribute anonymously, though with varied patterns; and (2) attributing anonymous traces diminishes empirical evidence used to support theory and change the results of system algorithms. These results suggest anonymous traces have implications for research on user behaviors and the practices associated with using such data to tailor user experiences in online communities.",

      "abstract": "Microfinance is an inherently social process. Over the years, it has emerged as an essential means for providing financial services to the “underbanked” population in developing countries. This paper presents a qualitative study focused on understanding existing cooperative practices associated with microfinance in rural Sri Lanka. Through semi-structured interviews, group discussions and visits to microfinance centres, we found that microfinancing involves much more than financial transactions, rather it is strongly habituated in the sociocultural fabric of communities. Our findings show that three factors affect the cooperative process of microfinancing: trust and credibility, community support, and familial assistance. Using examples from the field, this paper discusses the importance of these factors in microfinance activities and contributes an elaborated account of cooperative practices that support microfinance processes. We also highlight how the local sociocultural structures and practices shape the way microfinance processes are being handled. We contribute towards an in-depth understanding of such practices that can be useful for microfinance institutions (MFIs) and technology designers. Consequently, we advocate for an intermediary path for technology interventions where technology and people work together rather than technology replacing people.",

A separate and growing body of research in these same communities is developing ways to understand the design and use of social media from a curating perspective. A curating perspective focuses on how social media is designed and used by people to develop and manage their own digital archives. This paper uses a cultural heritage museum as the empirical basis and setting along with new information visualization methods we have developed to better integrate these bodies of work and introduce the concept of personal curation; a socio-technical practice in which people collect, edit, and share information using personal information devices and social media as they move through physical environments rich with meaning potential. In doing so this paper makes three contributions. First, it illustrates how to combine a spatial focus on people's movement and interaction through the physical environment with an analysis of social media use in order to gain a deeper understanding of practices such as personal curation. Second, it shows in greater detail how visitors to museums and cultural heritage sites use and link digital information with physical information to shape others' understandings of cultural heritage. Third, it suggests how museums and cultural heritage sites may leverage personal curation to support more expansive learning opportunities for visitors.",

In this paper, we report the results of a mixed-methods algorithm audit of partisan audience bias and personalization within Google Search. Following Donald Trump's inauguration, we recruited 187 participants to complete a survey and install a browser extension that enabled us to collect Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) from their computers. To quantify partisan audience bias, we developed a domain-level score by leveraging the sharing propensities of registered voters on a large Twitter panel. We found little evidence for the ``filter bubble'' hypothesis. Instead, we found that results positioned toward the bottom of Google SERPs were more left-leaning than results positioned toward the top, and that the direction and magnitude of overall lean varied by search query, component type (e.g. ``answer boxes''), and other factors. Utilizing rank-weighted metrics that we adapted from prior work, we also found that Google's rankings shifted the average lean of SERPs to the right of their unweighted average.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "GrabYourWallet, #boycottNRA and other online boycott campaigns have attracted substantial public interest in recent months. However, a number of significant challenges are preventing online boycotts from reaching their potential. In particular, complex webs of brands and subsidiaries can make it difficult for participants to conform to the goals of a boycott. Similarly, participants and organizers have limited visibility into a boycott’s progress. This affects their ability to use sociotechnical innovations from social computing to incentivize participation. To address these challenges, this paper makes a system contribution: a new boycott tool called Out of Site. Out of Site uses lightweight automation to remove obstacles to successful online boycotts. We describe the design challenges associated with Out of Site and report results from two phases of deployment with the GrabYourWallet and Stop Animal Testing boycott communities. Our findings highlight the potential of boycott-assisting technologies and inform the design of this new class of technologies. Finally, like is the case for many systems in social computing, while we designed Out of Site for pro-social uses, there are a number of easily predictable ways in which the system can be leveraged for anti-social purposes (e.g. exacerbating filter bubble issues, empowering boycotts of businesses owned by racial, ethnic, and religious minorities). As such, we developed for this project a new, very straightforward design approach that treats preventing these anti-social uses as a top-tier design concern. This approach stands in contrast to the status quo of ignoring potential anti-social uses and/or considering them to be a secondary design priority. We discuss how our simple approach may help other research projects reduce their potential negative impacts with minimal burden.",

This paper presents two between-subjects experiments that investigate the effect of Ingroup/Outgroup membership on effort spent in peer evaluations, and whether the group membership criterion affects quality and stringency of evaluation. Two peer-review assignments were implemented in two separate classes. In the first study, students were nominally grouped by location they sat in class and non-nominally grouped by current class score; each was asked to review an Ingroup and Outgroup peer assignment. A second study randomly assigned students to one of four group types (random, score, motivation, and location); students reviewed two Ingroup assignments. In both studies, score-grouped students graded their peers more stringently than students grouped by location.

      "abstract": "Previous research has shown that communication technologies may make it challenging for working professionals to manage the boundaries between their work life and home life. For college students, however, there is a less clear definition of what constitutes work and what constitutes home life. As a result, students may use different boundary management strategies than working professionals. To explore this issue, we interviewed 29 undergraduates about how they managed boundaries between different areas of their life. Interviewees reported maintaining flexible and permeable boundaries that are not bounded physically or temporally. They used both technological and non-technological strategies to manage different life spheres. Interviewees saw technology as a major source of boundary violations but also as a boundary managing strategy that allowed them to achieve better life balance. Based on these findings, we propose design implications for tools to better support the boundary management processes of undergraduate students.",

      "abstract": "Critique is an important component of creative work in design education and practice, through which individuals can solicit advice and obtain feedback on their work. Face-to-face critique in offline settings such as design studios has been well-documented and theorized. However, little is known about unstructured distributed critique in online creative communities where people share and critique each other’s work, and how these practices might resemble or differ from studio critique. In this paper, we use mixed-methods to examine distributed critique practices in a UX-focused online creative community on Reddit. We found that distributed critique resembles studio critique categorically, but differs qualitatively. While studio critique often focuses on depth, distributed critique often revolved around collective sensemaking, through which creative workers engaged in iteratively interpreting, defining, and refining the artifact and their process. We discuss the relationship between distributed critique and socio-technical systems and identify implications for future research. ",

Yet, accessibility of speech interaction can still be a challenge. Using and designing voice interfaces is radically different from graphical interfaces, redefining how we must think about accessibility and what it means for a conversation to be accessible.",

Viewers of these ‘creative streams’ gather to watch the streamer at work and to interact with the streamer and other audience members. However, little is known about how creative streamers engage with their audience, how their viewership communities form and operate, and how creative streams may support learning. In this study, we used a participant-observer method to study game development streams on the live streaming site Twitch.tv. We found that live streams support the growth of learning-focused communities that mentor both the streamer and each other during and after streams. We show the influence of streamers in creating a space for learning and motivating learners. Finally, we discuss implications for online education and communities of practice.",

      "abstract": "Holistic reviews are a common practice employed by colleges in the United States to make admissions decisions. It is an individualized review process where reviewers assess an applicant's potential by considering various criteria including academic metrics, adversities faced, and personal attributes. While the factors considered in such reviews are broadly known, a detailed walk-through of the process is absent in the existing literature. This is important to understand what is done in practice and to identify opportunities for technological interventions to support the complex and changing process. We employed cognitive task analysis and a socio-organizational approach to understand the holistic review process at a highly-selective, private university. We found the process to be nuanced and complex owing its complexity both to the numerous variables involved and the reviewers' thought processes. We present a rigorous, structured characterization of the review process and suggest possible leverage points for applying visualization decision-support tools.",

We based our studies on theories from organizational science, which suggest that it is not just the amount of turnover, but the \\textit{characteristics} of those leaving and those joining that matter. We characterized leavers and newcomers by their prior productivity, tenure (in the group or community), and  participation in other groups within the larger community. Furthermore, we considered the moderating effect of group size on turnover. We analyzed data from 88,427 editors who participated in 1,054 WikiProjects, finding that (1) the positive effects of newcomers to a group were larger than the negative effects of leavers, (2) prior productivity, tenure, and participation in other groups all played significant roles, and (3) the effects of leavers and newcomers were amplified in larger groups.",

      "abstract": "Real-Time Collaborative Editing (RTCE) is a popular way of instrumenting cooperative work on documents, in particular on the Web. Little is known in the literature yet about RTCE usage patterns in the real world. In this paper we study how a popular RTCE editor (Etherpad) is used in the wild, digging into the edit histories of a large collection of documents (about 14000 pads), retrieved from one of the most popular public instances of the platform, hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation.The pad analysis is supported by a novel conceptual model that allows to label edit operations as 'collaborative' or not depending on their distance - in edit position (space), edit time, or spacetime (both) - from edits made by other authors. The model is applied to classify all edits from the pad corpus. Classification results are further used to characterize the collaboration behavior of pad authors. Findings show that: (1) about half of the pads have a single author and hence witnessed no collaboration; (2) collaboration on common document parts happens often, but it happens asynchronously with authors taking turns in editing; and (3) simultaneous editing of common document parts happens very rarely. These findings help in revisiting early RTCE design decisions (e.g., the granularity of conflict management in RTCE protocols) and give insights on how to address novel needs (e.g., end-to-end encryption and offline editing).",

To understand how these changes impacted CSCW research, we systematically reviewed 1209 papers and notes published at the ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work between 1990 and 2015. When considered with results from two previous literature reviews, covering 1990 - 1998 and 1998 - 2004 respectively, our analysis provides perspective on 25 years of groupware research. We show that the field has responded to, not anticipated, changes in the computing landscape, long-term trends away from `systems' and explanatory research, and a lack of bibliographic research that synthesizes findings. Finally, we discuss implications of these trends for CSCW research: how results are synthesized across the field, what kinds of research we value, and how multi-device ecologies are studied.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "We investigate how data-analyst productivity benefits from collaborative platforms that facilitate learning-by-doing (i.e. analysts learning by writing queries on their own) and learning-by-viewing (i.e. analysts learning by viewing queries written by peers).  Learning is measured using a behavioral (productivity-improvement) approach. Productivity is measured using the time from creating an empty query to first executing it. Using a sample of 2,001 data analysts at eBay Inc. who have written 79,797 queries from 2014 to 2018, we find that: 1) learning-by-doing is associated with significant productivity improvement when the analyst's prior experience focuses on the focally queried database; 2) only learning-by-viewing queries that are authored by analysts with high output rate (average number of queries written per month) is associated with significant improvement in the viewer's productivity; 3) learning-by-viewing also depends on the ''social influence'' of the author of the viewed query, which we measure 'locally' based on the number of the author's direct viewers per month or 'globally' based on the how the author's queries propagate to her peers in the overall collaboration network. Combining results 2 and 3, when segmenting analysts based on output rate and 'local' social influence, the viewing of queries authored by analysts with high output but low local influence is associated with the largest improvement in the viewer's productivity; whereas when segmenting based on output rate and 'global' social influence, the viewing of queries authored analysts with high output and high global influence is associated with the largest improvement in the viewer's productivity. Overall, regardless of the segmentation, learning-by-viewing is associated with greater productivity improvement than learning-by-doing in our study.",

      "abstract": "Privacy has been a key research theme in the CSCW and HCI communities, but the term is often used in an ad hoc and fragmented way. This is likely due to the fact that privacy is a complex and multi-faceted concept. This one-day workshop will facilitate discourse around key privacy theories and frameworks that can inform privacy research with the goal of producing guidelines for privacy researchers on how and when to incorporate which theories into various aspects of their empirical privacy research. This will lay the groundwork to move the privacy field forward. To inspire participants and spark discussion, we will have a special keynote speaker, Dr. Helen Nissenbaum, engage with the audience about her renowned Contextual Integrity framework. Dr. Nissenbaum is a Professor of Information Science at Cornell Tech and her framework focuses on understanding privacy expectations and their implications.",

      "abstract": "In surgery, assemblages of imaging systems need to be managed, interfaced, and coordinated by a collocated team. In this paper, I untangle the different forms of imaging system interaction in this highly specialized multi-device environment (MDE). I show how the different forms of imaging systems affect the work practice by creating a need for additional articulation work. This articulation work is coordinated into the surgical practice on the body by either distributing the work across the team or by requiring a momentary pause of the surgical work for the entire team to attend to the articulation work to be done on or with the images. And we see how distributing the work across the team still requires a reintegration of the knowledge gleaned from the new information into the surgery itself. This presents an expansion of our understanding of how collocated teams function in MDEs that consist of purely shared displays.",

In this paper I draw on extensive ethnographic work to describe how users encounter and negotiate opportunities for participation on two participatory platforms, demonstrating how platforms can exhibit distinct spaces and opportunities for participation, in some cases heavily enforcing standards of practice defined by experts and leaders while also leaving room for emergent and even divergent and deviant behavior. In describing this tension between conditions of normative and deviant participation, I highlight the importance of supporting opportunities for deviant and emergent participation to occur, emphasizing that design which uniquely supports narrow modes of participation can prevent opportunities for more inclusionary practice and evolving objectives.",

Online “Ask the doctor” (AtD) services have become increasingly popular, because they allow patients and caregivers to obtain advice from medical professionals at a lower information and transaction cost. In this paper, we present an empirical study of Fenda, an innovative AtD platform recently introduced in China through which patients and caregivers can consult a wide variety of healthcare professionals for a small fee. Using qualitative research methods, we analyzed how patients and caregivers interact with medical professionals on this platform, focusing on the nature of the questions asked and potential motivation for using the platform. Based on the results, we derived implications for designing better online AtD services connecting patients and caregivers to medical professionals.",

      "abstract": "For millions of workers, online job listings provide the first point of contact to potential employers. As a result, job listings and their word choices can significantly affect the makeup of the responding applicant pool. Here, we study the effects of potentially gender-biased terminology in job listings, and their impact on job applicants, using a large historical corpus of 17 million listings on LinkedIn spanning 10 years. We develop algorithms to detect and quantify gender bias, validate them using external tools, and use them to quantify job listing bias over time. We then perform a user survey over two user populations (N$_1$=469, N$_2$=273) to validate our findings and to quantify the end-to-end impact of such bias on applicant decisions. Our findings show gender-bias has decreased significantly over the last 10 years. More surprisingly, we find that impact of gender bias in listings is dwarfed by our respondents' inherent bias towards specific job types.",

      "abstract": "Like sighted people, visually impaired people want to share photographs on social networking services, but find it difficult to identify and select photos from their albums. We aimed to address this problem by incorporating state-of-the-art computer-generated descriptions into Facebook’s photo-sharing feature. We interviewed 12 visually impaired participants to understand their photo-sharing experiences and designed a photo description feature for the Facebook mobile application. We evaluated this feature with six participants in a seven-day diary study. We found that participants used the descriptions to recall and organize their photos, but they hesitated to upload photos without a sighted person’s input. In addition to basic information about photo content, participants wanted to know more details about salient objects and people, and whether the photos reflected their personal aesthetic. We discuss these findings from the lens of self-disclosure and self-presentation theories and propose new computer vision research directions that will better support visual content sharing by visually impaired people.",

      "abstract": "Our paper provides an enriched understanding of the relationship between research and practice through the study of practitioners variously engaged in field research on technology interventions in the context of global development. By conducting a qualitative inquiry with 33 practitioners from 26 global development organizations, we highlight how these practitioners have different goals, work practices, incentive structures, and expectations than researchers, making it challenging to co-create and coordinate productive and effective partnerships. Despite these challenges, practitioners in global development do appear to value and engage with research as they strive for positive impact across their target communities. Our analysis suggests that the domain of human-computer interaction for development (HCI4D) might benefit from engaging in \\textit{``informed practice''} through alignment with design-based implementation research (DBIR), which unites researchers and practitioners in their shared commitment to both research and practice, even if research and practice respectively remain their primary commitments. Our work provides CSCW and HCI4D researchers with new ways to conceptualize and navigate the above research-practice divide. We also emphasize the contribution such an approach might make to CSCW researchers beyond the context of global development, and more broadly concerned with making a positive societal impact with their work.",

      "abstract": "Self-tracking refers to the use of computational sensing devices that track data about user behavior to provide self-knowledge. Self-tracking devices are often designed to function transparently, with minimal user awareness of the tracking process. Although effective from an information-processing perspective, this invisibility can also background issues of materiality and user experience. Further, research on self-tracking has shown that devices are often abandoned, can cause user anxiety, and reflect hegemonic social norms. Self-tracking is an emerging technology and skilled cultural practice, but its central issues—the space of design possibility, the nature of user needs/experiences, and sociopolitical implications—remain unclear. We present Persuasive Anxiety, a project informed by research through design, critical design, and design deployment studies. We report on the design and longitudinal deployment of three designs—Candy Camera, Melody Bot, and Fractured View—to spark critical dialogue about self-tracking. The project helped reveal some the relationships between self-tracking and destructive social norms, as well as how they might be mitigated; the emergence of self-tracking as a performative cultural skill; and the possibility of bringing digital content authoring tools/research into a closer dialogue with self-tracking to give self-trackers greater agency over this cultural practice.",

More recently, crisis informatics has developed an analysis of these phenomena from social and computational perspectives. To further to assess the consequences and opportunities of technological developments in the field, we re-introduce the concept of informating, first developed by Zuboff to describe the impacts of technological changes on the workplace during the 1980s. We draw on four contemporary examples of how ICT is changing the way we conceive of and respond to natural hazards to offer a new reading of the concept of informating in the growing field of crisis informatics. We then argue that this concept suggests the adoption of a more critical agenda for crisis informatics research to better respond to contemporary challenges presented by climate change and natural hazards.",

We implemented previous design recommendations, namely separate physical territories and activity roles, which had been recommended to decrease these negative collaborative behaviors. We developed a multi-touch \"I-Spy\" picture searching application with separate territory partitions and activity roles. We conducted a deep qualitative analysis of how six pairs of children, ages 6 to 10, interacted with the application. Our analysis revealed that the collaboration styles differed for each pair, both in regards to the interaction with the task and with each other. Several pairs exhibited negative physical and verbal collaborative behaviors, such as nudging each other out of the way. Based on our analysis, we suggest that it is important for a collaborative task to offer equal opportunities for interaction, but it may not be necessary to strive for complete equity of collaboration. We examine the applicability of prior design guidelines and suggest open questions for future research to inform the design of tabletop applications to support collaboration for children.",

      "abstract": "Individual empowerment is defined as an increased sense of confidence and control over one's life. Empowerment is critical in low-income communities, and can be facilitated through the development of social, financial and human capital. We present a qualitative study of a community program that seeks to empower low-income neighborhood residents through a mobile application that connects them to local resources. Our findings highlight how the application and offline socio-organizational mechanisms worked in tandem to create gateways for capital building-sparking connections (to people and opportunities) that residents leveraged with varying motivations and outcomes. We also discuss how the interplay of newly-developed financial, social, and human capital contributed to residents' sense of empowerment and impacted their families. We contribute to CSCW by extending an existing community informatics framework, characterizing the value of sociotechnical systems that holistically build social, financial, and human capital amongst neighborhood residents.",

      "abstract": "Participants in cryptocurrency markets are in constant communication with each other about the latest coins and news releases. Do these conversations build hype through the contagiousness of excitement, help the community process information, or play some other role? Using a novel dataset from a major cryptocurrency forum, we conduct an exploratory study of the characteristics of online discussion around cryptocurrencies. Through a regression analysis, we find that coins with more information available and higher levels of technical innovation are associated with higher quality discussion. People who talk about \"serious\" coins tend to participate in discussion displaying signatures of collective intelligence and information processing, while people who talk about \"less serious\" coins tend to display signatures of hype and naïvety. Interviews with experienced forum members also confirm these quantitative findings. These results highlight the varied roles of discussion in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and suggest that discussion of serious coins may be oriented towards earnest, perhaps more accurate, attempts at discovering which coins are likely to succeed.",

      "abstract": "Understanding tobacco- and alcohol-related behavioral patterns is critical for uncovering risk factors and potentially designing targeted social computing intervention systems. Given that we make choices multiple times per day, hourly and daily patterns are critical for better understanding behaviors. Here, we combine natural language processing, machine learning and time series analyses to assess Twitter activity specifically related to alcohol and tobacco consumption and their sub-daily, daily and weekly cycles. Twitter self-reports of alcohol and tobacco use are compared to other data streams available at similar temporal resolution. We assess if discussion of drinking by inferred underage versus legal age people or discussion of use of different types of tobacco products can be differentiated using these temporal patterns. We find that time and frequency domain representations of behaviors on social media can provide meaningful and unique insights, and we discuss the types of behaviors for which the approach may be most useful.",

      "abstract": "In asynchronous online discussions, users actively reference visual materials (e.g., video, document) to provide supporting evidence and additional context. However, creating and comprehending complex references can be challenging, especially when there are multiple referents to refer, or when a referent is highly specific (e.g., specific sentences in a paper rather than the paper as a whole). To identify users’ challenges in making references with multiple and specific referents while using existing discussion tools, we conducted an observational study and a preliminary interview. Based on the design lessons, we built Korero, a discussion interface that aims to facilitate complex referencing actions. For evaluation, we compared Korero against conventional interfaces in two user studies with referencing tasks of different referential difficulty. We found that Korero not only significantly reduces the time and effort in making references with multiple and specific referents, but also shows potential in increasing users’ engagement with the discussion and referent materials.",

Through a qualitative analysis of 41 online toolkits, we present a set of key design dimensions: agentive scale (who is responsible for security), achievability (can security be achieved), and interventional stage (when are security measures taken). Recognizing toolkits as socially and culturally situated, we surface ways in which toolkits construct security as a value and, in so doing, how they construct people as (in)secure users. We center the notion of differential vulnerabilities, an understanding of security that recognizes safety as socially contingent, adversaries as unstable figures, and risk as differentially applied based on markers of relational position (e.g. class, race, religion, gender, geography, experience). We argue that differential vulnerabilities provides a key design concern in future security resources, and a critical concept for security discourses.",

Finding the perfect GIF can make conversations funny, interesting, and engaging, but GIFs also introduce potentials for miscommunication. Through 24 in-depth qualitative interviews, this empirical, exploratory study examines the nuances of communication practices with animated GIFs to better understand why and how GIFs can send unintentional messages. We find participants leverage contexts like source material and interpersonal relationship to find the perfect GIFs for different communication scenarios, while these contexts are also the primary reason for miscommunication and some technical usability issues in GIFs. This paper concludes with a discussion of the important role that different types of context play in the use and interpretations of GIFs, and argues that nonverbal communication tools should account for complex contexts and common ground that communication media rely on.",

      "abstract": "This paper replicates, extends, and refutes conclusions made in a study published in PLoS ONE (\"Even Good Bots Fight\"), which claimed to identify substantial levels of conflict between automated software agents (or bots) in Wikipedia using purely quantitative methods. By applying an integrative mixed-methods approach drawing on trace ethnography, we place these alleged cases of bot-bot conflict into context and arrive at a better understanding of these interactions. We found that overwhelmingly, the interactions previously characterized as problematic instances of conflict are typically better characterized as routine, productive, even collaborative work. These results challenge past work and show the importance of qualitative/quantitative collaboration. In our paper, we present quantitative metrics and qualitative heuristics for operationalizing bot-bot conflict. We give thick descriptions of kinds of events that present as bot-bot reverts, helping distinguish conflict from non-conflict. We computationally classify these kinds of events through patterns in edit summaries. By interpreting found/trace data in the socio-technical contexts in which people give that data meaning, we gain more from quantitative measurements, drawing deeper understandings about the governance of algorithmic systems in Wikipedia. We have also released our data collection, processing, and analysis pipeline, to facilitate computational reproducibility of our findings and to help other researchers interested in conducting similar mixed-method scholarship in other platforms and contexts.",

In many online health communities, writing comprises a substantial portion of the user experience, yet little work has explored how writing itself affects user engagement. This paper explores user engagement on CaringBridge, a prominent online community for writing about personal health journeys. We build a survival analysis model, defining a new set of variables that operationalize expressive writing, and comparing these effects to those of social support, which are well-known to benefit user engagement. Furthermore, we use machine learning methods to estimate that approximately one third of community members who self-identify with a cancer condition cease engagement due to literal death. Finally, we provide quantitative evidence that: (1) receiving support, expressive writing, and giving support, in decreasing magnitude of relative impact, are associated with user engagement on CaringBridge, and (2) that considering deceased sites separately in our analysis significantly shifts our interpretations of user behavior.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we sought to understand the experiences and disability disclosure preferences of adults with and without disabilities who have dated online. Our 91 survey respondents expressed varying opinions about the need for potential partners to disclose disability status when online dating depending on the nature or perceived severity, with “visible” disabilities carrying a higher expectation of upfront disclosure than “invisible” disabilities. Many disabled respondents also described proactively disclosing as a technique to filter potential connections. Our findings suggest that individuals with disabilities must perform additional labor and navigate complex group norms in pursuit of personal connection. We advocate that the social computing research community consider how these processes are driven by both societal expectation and the constraints of online dating platforms. We then offer design considerations and open questions as a means to extend social computing study at the intersection of online dating and disability studies.",

      "abstract": "As increasingly many Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices collect personal data, users face more privacy decisions. Personal privacy assistants can provide social cues and help users make informed decisions by presenting information about how others have decided in similar cases. To better understand which social cues are relevant and whose recommendations users are more likely to follow, we presented 1000 online participants with nine IoT data collection scenarios. Some participants were told the percentage of experts or friends who allowed data collection in each scenario, while other participants were provided no social cue. At the conclusion of each scenario, participants were asked whether they would allow the described data collection. Our results indicate that when friends denied data collection, our participants were more influenced than when friends allowed data collection. On the other hand, participants were more influenced by experts when they allowed data collection.In addition, we observed that influence could get stronger or wear off over a repeated sequence of scenarios.  For example, when experts and friends repeatedly allowed scenarios with clear risk or denied scenarios with clear benefits, participants were less likely to be influenced by them in subsequent scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Successful online communities accumulate large amounts of long-term content. However there has been little quantitative, theoretically-motivated exploration of how communities organize such content, nor which community members take responsibility for active organization. We examine one aspect of long-term content organization through link behavior, also exploring role differences between enterprise community leaders and members in the context of life-cycle community models. We first classify how content is linked within posts, identifying usage patterns that organize information within and outside communities. We next present an exploratory quantitative analysis of 2,010 communities including 428,476 posts and 1,246,570 links. We show paradoxically that although mature communities accumulate substantial content, organizing that content using links decreases over time. Further analyses suggest that this arises from a recency bias, with communities being focused on current content. Our results also challenge descriptive lifecycle community models, which propose that regular community members adopt greater responsibility over time. We explore explanations for our findings and implications including new tools that encourage responsibility for active organization, as well as methods for members to revisit critical content.",

      "abstract": "Conspiracy theories have gained much academic and media attention recently, due to their large impact on public events. Crisis informatics researchers have examined conspiracy theories as a type of rumor. However, little is known about how conspiracy theories are produced and developed on social media. We present a qualitative study of conspiracy theorizing on Reddit during a public health crisis—the Zika virus outbreak. Using a mixed-methods approach including content analysis and discourse analysis, we identified types of conspiracy theories that appeared on Reddit in response to the Zika crisis, the conditions under which Zika conspiracy theories emerge, and the particular discursive strategies through which Zika conspiracy theories developed in online forums. Our analysis shows that conspiracy talk emerged as people attempted to make sense of a public health crisis, reflecting their emergent information needs and their pervasive distrust in formal sources of Zika information. Practical implications for social computing researchers, health practitioners, and policymakers are discussed.",

      "abstract": "We describe an observational study of work coordination in an emergency communication center, where a collocated team of communication specialists engages in complex activities of communicating with pre-hospital medical teams, and coordinating patient care and transport. Unlike teams with clearly defined work roles and team structures that were introduced to increase work efficiency and minimize redundancy, the team we studied lacks the role differentiation. To better understand how complex work is accomplished under these conditions, we conducted in-situ observations in the center’s control room and interviewed communication specialists. We found that communication specialists self-organized by using a mix of material and immaterial coordination mechanisms, including work schedules, computer systems, and tacit agreements to coordinate tasks. Using these findings, we then identified three features of self-organized, collocated and time-critical teamwork that require technology support: awareness of task ownership, task self-assignment, and informal team hierarchy. We conclude by discussing technology requirements to support these teamwork features.",

We present an analysis of Requests for Comments (RfCs), one of the main vehicles on Wikipedia for formally resolving a policy or content dispute. We collected an exhaustive dataset of 7,316 RfCs on English Wikipedia over the course of 7 years and conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis into what issues affect the RfC process. Our analysis was informed by 10 interviews with frequent RfC closers. We found that a major issue affecting the RfC process is the prevalence of RfCs that could have benefited from formal closure but that linger indefinitely without one, with factors including participants' interest and expertise impacting the likelihood of resolution. From these findings, we developed a model that predicts whether an RfC will go stale with 75.3% accuracy, a level that is approached as early as one week after dispute initiation.",

      "abstract": "The fast-growing proliferation of multi-device systems has been reshaping the contexts in which collaborative activity takes place. The evolving materialisation of multi-device environments (MDEs) is likely to have an impact on foundational CSCW research, in ways that go beyond studying cross-device interaction. Designers, developers and researchers are reporting emerging challenges in understanding, supporting and designing for complex collaborative activity in MDEs. We argue that the theoretical perspective of Instrumental Genesis can help unveil the complex, dynamic relationships between design, people, tools, tasks and activities in technology-rich MDEs. In this paper, we use extracts from our research on collaborative work in an MDE to illustrate how ideas from the theory of Instrumental Genesis can help reveal important aspects of change and stability. We show how collaborative design-in-use contributes to the joint evolution of MDEs and the working practices unfolding within them.",

      "abstract": "Social media offers a unique window into attitudes like racism and homophobia, exposure to which are  important, hard to measure and understudied social determinants of health. However, individual geo-located observations from social media are noisy and geographically inconsistent. Existing areas by which exposures are measured, like Zip codes, average over irrelevant administratively-defined boundaries. Hence, in order to enable studies of online social environmental measures like attitudes on social media and their possible relationship to health outcomes, first there is a need for a method to define the collective, underlying degree of social media attitudes by region. To address this, we create the Socio-spatial-Self organizing map, \"SS-SOM\" pipeline to best identify regions by their latent social attitude from Twitter posts. SS-SOMs use neural embedding for text-classification, and augment traditional SOMs to generate a controlled number of non-overlapping, topologically-constrained and topically-similar clusters. We find that not only are SS-SOMs robust to missing data, the exposure of a cohort of men who are susceptible to multiple racism and homophobia-linked health outcomes, changes by up to 42% using SS-SOM measures as compared to using Zip code-based measures.",

      "abstract": "Natural disasters carry enormous costs every year, both in terms of lives and materials. Evacuation from potentially affected areas stands out among the most critical factors that can reduce mortality and vulnerability to crisis. We know surprisingly little about the factors that drive this important and often life-saving behavior, though recent work has suggested that social capital may play a critical and previously underestimated role in disaster preparedness. Moving beyond retrospective self-reporting and vehicle count estimates, we use social media data to examine connections between levels of social capital and evacuation behavior. This work is the first of its kind, examining these phenomena across three major disasters in the United States---Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, and Hurricane Maria---using aggregated, de-identified data from over 1.5 million Facebook users. Our analysis confirms that, holding confounding factors constant, several aspects of social capital are correlated with whether or not an individual evacuates. Higher levels of bridging and linking social ties correlate strongly with evacuation. However, these social capital related factors are not significantly associated with the rate of return after evacuation.",

      "abstract": "With the growing shift towards news consumption primarily through social media sites like Twitter, most of the traditional as well as new-age media houses are promoting their news stories by tweeting about them. The competition for user attention in such mediums has led many media houses to use catchy sensational form of tweets to attract more users - a process known as clickbaiting. In this work, using an extensive dataset collected from Twitter, we analyze the social sharing patterns of clickbait and non-clickbait tweets to determine the organic reach of such tweets. We also attempt to study the sections of Twitter users who actively engage themselves in following clickbait and non-clickbait tweets. Comparing the advent of clickbaits with the rise of tabloidization of news, we bring out several important insights regarding the news consumers as well as the media organizations promoting news stories on Twitter.",

      "abstract": "Web accessibility evaluation examines how well websites comply with accessibility guidelines which help people with disabilities to perceive, navigate and contribute to the Web. This demanding task usually requires manual assessment by experts with many years of training and experience. However, not enough experts are available to carry out the increasing number of evaluation projects while non-experts often have different opinions about the presence of accessibility barriers. Addressing these issues, we introduce a crowdsourcing system with a novel truth inference algorithm to derive reliable and accurate assessments from conflicting opinions of evaluators. Extensive evaluation on 23,901 complex tasks assessed by 50 people with and without disabilities shows that our approach outperforms state of the art approaches. In addition, we conducted surveys to identify frequent barriers that people with disabilities are facing in their daily lives and the difficulty to access Web pages when they encounter these barriers. The frequencies and severities of barriers correlate with their derived importance in our evaluation project.",

      "abstract": "Health forums and support groups depend on participant self-disclosure for their success, but the sensitive nature of personal health concerns raises privacy concerns that may constrain what users are willing to reveal. To address this issue, we explore the impact of visual cues designed to convey (1) two facets of social influence—crowd size and social network connectivity—and (2) provide a frame designed to enhance the forum’s sense of community. A 3 (Cue type: Crowd, Connectivity, None) x 2 (Framing) factorial experiment (N = 218) showed that cues implying greater crowd size and connectivity lead to more self-disclosure of sensitive information, and higher intentions to revisit the community. Further, user belief in the community-building heuristic positively predicts self-disclosure and intentions, while also moderating the effect of the connectivity cue in a direction which implies that the cue encourages disclosure by triggering the community-building heuristic. Implications for the design of online groups are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Professional sports constitute an important part of people's modern life. People spend substantial amounts of time and money supporting their favorite players and teams, and sometimes even riot after games. However, how team performance affects fan behavior remains understudied at a large scale. As almost every notable professional team has its own online fan community, these communities provide great opportunities for investigating this research question. In this work, we provide the first large-scale characterization of online fan communities of professional sports teams. Since user behavior in these online fan communities is inherently connected to game events and team performance, we construct a unique dataset that combines 1.5M posts and 43M comments in NBA-related communities on Reddit with statistics that document team performance in the NBA. We analyze the impact of team performance on fan behavior both at the game level and the season level. First, we study how team performance in a game relates to user activity during that game. We find that surprise plays an important role: the fans of the top teams are more active when their teams lose and so are the fans of the bottom teams in an unexpected win. Second, we study fan behavior over consecutive seasons and show that strong team performance is associated with fans of low loyalty, likely due to \"bandwagon fans.\" Fans of the bottom teams tend to discuss their team's future such as young talents in the roster, which may help them stay optimistic during adversity. Our results not only contribute to understanding the interplay between online sports communities and offline context but also provide significant insights into sports management.",

      "abstract": "Bots have been important to peer production’s success. Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, and Wikidata all have taken advantage of automation to perform work at a rate and scale exceeding that of human contributors. Understanding the ways in which humans and bots behave in these communities is an important topic, and one that relies on accurate bot recognition. Yet, in many cases, bot activities are not explicitly flagged and could be mistaken for human contributions. We develop a machine classifier to detect previously unidentified bots using implicit behavioral and other informal editing characteristics. We show that this method yields a high level of fitness under both formal evaluation (PR-AUC: .845, ROC-AUC: .985) and a qualitative analysis of “anonymous” contributor edit sessions. We also show that, in some cases, unflagged bot activities can significantly misrepresent human behavior in analyses. Our model has the potential to support future research and community patrolling activities.",

      "abstract": "Computational notebooks aim to support collaborative data analysis by combining code, visualizations, and text in a single easily shared document. Yet, as notebooks evolve and grow they often become difficult to navigate or understand, discouraging sharing and reuse. We present the design and evaluation of a Jupyter Notebook extension providing facilities for annotated cell folding. Through a lab study and multi-week deployment we find cell folding aids notebook navigation and comprehension, not only by the original author, but also by collaborators viewing the notebook in a meeting or revising it on their own. However, in some cases cell folding encouraged collaborators to overlook folded sections or spend longer reviewing a notebook before editing it. These findings extend our understanding of code folding's trade-offs to a new medium and demonstrate its benefits for everyday collaboration. We conclude by discussing how dynamic reorganization can support sharing and reuse of computational notebooks.",

      "abstract": "Collectives gather online around challenges they face, but frequently fail to envision shared outcomes to act on together. Prior work has developed systems for improving collective ideation and design by exposing people to each others' ideas and encouraging them to intermix those ideas. However, organizational behavior research has demonstrated that intermixing ideas does not result in meaningful engagement with those ideas. In this paper, we introduce a new class of collective design system that intermixes people instead of ideas: instead of receiving mere exposure to others' ideas, participants engage deeply with other members of the collective who represent those ideas, increasing engagement and influence. We thus present Hive: a system that  organizes a collective into small teams, then intermixes people by  rotating team membership over time. At a technical level, Hive must balance two competing forces: (1) networks are better at connecting diverse perspectives when network efficiency is high, but (2) moving people diminishes tie strength within teams. Hive balances these two needs through network rotation: an optimization algorithm that computes who should move where, and when. A controlled study compared network rotation to alternative rotation systems which maximize only tie strength or network efficiency, finding that network rotation produced higher-rated proposals. Hive has been deployed by Mozilla for a real-world open design drive to improve Firefox accessibility.",

These reservoirs are knowable only through a knowledge infrastructure of interconnected technologies that are applied to diverse instrument-generated data. Noise, holes, and inaccuracies are inherent in the data, which depend on the technology producing it. We conducted an interpretative case study of data handling work in the exploration unit of a European oil company. Our findings show how data handling involves the skills needed for managing data identities and ownership, a variety of technologies, and contingent negotiations of data needs. We use the notion of repair to analyze this data handling work and discuss how the concept of repair in data handling involves keeping the knowledge infrastructure navigable and attending to countless details. Our research contributes to the literature on repairing infrastructures by considering how repair relates to data work.",

In this paper, we present an automated approach to identify and classify meta-comments. We compare comment classification based on manually extracted features with an end-to-end learning approach. We develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple classifiers on a comment dataset of the large German online newsroom SPIEGEL Online and the \"One Million Posts\" corpus of DER STANDARD, an Austrian newspaper. Both optimized classification approaches achieved encouraging F0.5 values between 76% and 91%. We report on the most significant classification features with the results of a qualitative analysis and discuss how our work contributes to making participation in online journalism more constructive.",

Its users are responsible for maintaining the schema that organises this knowledge into classes, properties, and attributes, which together form the Wikidata 'ontology'.  In this paper, we study the relationship between different Wikidata user roles and the quality of the Wikidata ontology. To do so we first propose a framework to evaluate the ontology as it evolves. We then cluster editing activities to identify user roles in monthly time frames. Finally, we explore how each role impacts the ontology. Our analysis shows that the Wikidata ontology has uneven breadth and depth. We identified two user roles: contributors and leaders. The second category is positively associated to ontology depth, with no significant effect on other features. Further work should investigate other dimensions to define user profiles and their influence on the knowledge graph.",

      "abstract": "In many traditional labor markets, women earn less on average compared to men. However, it is unclear whether this discrepancy persists in the online gig economy, which bears important differences from the traditional labor market (e.g., more flexible work arrangements, shorter-term engagements, reputation systems). In this study, we collected self-determined hourly bill rates from the public profiles of 48,019 workers in the United States (48.8% women) on Upwork, a popular gig work platform. The median female worker set hourly bill rates that were 74% of the median man's hourly bill rates, a gap than cannot be entirely explained by online and offline work experience, education level, and job category. However, in some job categories, we found evidence of a more complex relationship between gender and earnings: women earned more overall than men by working more hours, outpacing the effect of lower hourly bill rates. To better support equality in the rapidly growing gig economy,  we encourage continual evaluation of the complex gender dynamics on these platforms and discuss whose responsibility it is to address inequalities.",

      "abstract": "In Twitter, there is a rising trend in abusive behavior which often leads to incivility . This trend is affecting users mentally and as a result they tend to leave Twitter and other such social networking sites thus depleting the active user base. In this paper, we study factors associated with incivility. We observe that the act of incivility is highly correlated with the opinion differences between the account holder (i.e., the user writing the incivil tweet) and the target (i.e., the user for whom the incivil tweet is meant for or targeted), toward a named entity. We introduce a character level CNN model and incorporate the entity-specific sentiment information for efficient incivility detection which significantly outperforms multiple baseline methods achieving an impressive accuracy of 93.3% (4.9% improvement over the best baseline). In a post-hoc analysis, we also study the behavioral aspects of the targets and account holders and try to understand the reasons behind the incivility incidents. Interestingly, we observe that there are strong signals of repetitions in incivil behavior. In particular, we find that there are a significant fraction of account holders who act as repeat offenders - attacking the targets even more than 10 times. Similarly, there are also targets who get targeted multiple times. In general, the targets are found to have higher reputation scores than the account holders.",

Technology designed for the needs and values of people in recovery may be able to supplement traditional treatment options, enhance long-term abstinence maintenance, and create new opportunities for social support. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with women in recovery from substance use disorders to identify design opportunities for supportive technologies that align with the specific values, practices and traditions of the recovery community. Through a data-driven inductive qualitative analysis, we identify five major themes that may be addressed with technology: 1) supporting twelve-step traditions and practices, 2) management of restlessness and moments of crisis, 3) agency and control over privacy and personal safety, 4) tracking progress and maintaining motivation, and 5) constructing a new normal. We connect these themes to specific implications for design.",

      "abstract": "UMI3D is a recent model which allows the generic description of 3D environments through a network. These generic environments can run outside of any device, on a server or on a separate computer. A unique dedicated application that we have named UMI3D client allows a VR, AR or MR device to interact with all the existing UMI3D environments. Moreover, the client-server architecture allows these environments to be collaborative. In this paper, we introduce a toolbox which allows the creation and running of UMI3D collaborative environments using Unity 3D. It contains tools to address the main concerns of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) systems in UMI3D environments. After introducing the contribution of this toolbox to the design of 3D CSCW systems, we present a user evaluation of an environment designed with this toolbox. Finally, we discuss the limits of the UMI3D model and the improvements that could be made to this model.",

      "abstract": "Navigation services using digital maps make people's travel much easier. However, these services often fail to provide specific routes to those destinations that lack micro data in digital maps, such as a small laundry store in a shopping area. In this paper, we propose CrowdNavi, a last mile navigation service in outdoor environments using crowdsourcing based on the guider-follower model. First, we collect trajectories of guiders and images of reference objects along trajectories. To guide followers by reference objects along the route, we design a Semantic Crowd Navigation model to generate fine-grained maps by integrating guiders' data. Second, we design two score functions to fulfill two main requirements and plan hints. Last, we provide context-aware navigation for followers based on the fine-grained map and detect deviation in real-time. Real world experiments conducted in three different areas show that our proposed system in combination with images of reference objects is efficient.",

However, crafting these prompts had little effect on the quality of comments they posted to a simulated discussion forum following the prompt task, as measured by the reasoning and topic coherence of comments.

      "abstract": "Journalistic work is increasingly conducted using cooperative technologies. But while journalists need security and privacy just like professionals in sectors like health and education, constrained finances and missing legal requirements cause journalists to rely mostly on third-party platforms for their professional communications. In this study, we analyze how journalists manage professional collaborations across myriad tasks and contexts, with a focus on how their security and privacy concerns may shape these behaviors. We find that journalists' relatively open information-sharing practices may reflect the strength of their informal intra-organizational networks, rather than their organizational commitment per se. Moreover, while journalists—like many workers—manage their security and privacy concerns by avoiding sensitive communications via certain channels, the physical shrinking newsrooms of is reducing opportunities for the face-to-face communications journalists rely on for secure, private, professional exchange. Journalists' self-censorship on collaborative platforms therefore warrants particular attention given journalism's essential role in the public sphere.",

Following a strength-based approach, we collected data via home visits and semi-structured interviews involving 14 participants, and observed activities at the care center over 8 months. Our participants exhibited three key facets of resilience: (1) resilience as an integral part of their everyday lives, (2) a spirited phenomenon, and (3) a social and care-focused process. We contribute empirical insights into our participants’ situated resilience and articulate ways through which design can support their existing social and collaborative practices.

Such social games enable different interaction modes, in which players engage with combinations of co-located physical environments, remote virtual environments, and players, both co-located and remote, to complete game objectives. These sophisticated collaborative systems are not easy to build; rather, they require considerable effort including designing virtual game elements, selecting suitable technologies, defining indoor/outdoor boundaries of play, and ensuring player safety. Recent advances in technology open a range of opportunities for designing new and innovative collaborative mixed reality games, and valuable insights can be gained from researchers, developers, and players on the challenges, opportunities, and lessons learned through research and design of such games. We assert that a cohesive research agenda is needed to further develop this field, which is currently lacking within the respectively interested research communities.

We sampled 351 popular projects from GitHub and found that 93 (26%) use bots. We classified the bots, collected metrics from before and after bot adoption, and surveyed 228 developers and integrators. Our results indicate that bots perform numerous tasks. Although integrators reported that bots are useful for maintenance tasks, we did not find a consistent, statistically significant difference between before and after bot adoption across the analyzed projects in terms of number of comments, commits, changed files, and time to close pull requests. Our survey respondents deem the current bots as not smart enough and provided insights into the bots' relevance for specific tasks, challenges, and potential new features. We discuss some of the raised suggestions and challenges in light of the literature in order to help GitHub bot designers reuse and test ideas and technologies already investigated in other contexts.",

      "abstract": "Team-based learning is a structured, small-group learning method that has been associated with many positive outcomes in traditional classroom settings. However, relatively little research has focused on how to form and support teams within online learning platforms, such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). A number of challenges arise for team formation in voluntary online classes: students may drop out and leave their team, and even if they do persist with the course, the team may not work together effectively.In this paper, we introduce a team-formation strategy that incorporates a deliberation process, where participants hold discussions in preparation for the collaboration task. First, we present a crowdsourced experiment that compares teams that are formed before or after a community deliberation process. Results demonstrate that teams engaging in a larger community deliberative process prior to team formation exhibit better team performance--as measured by team collaboration product quality--than pre-discussion teams. In a second crowdsourced experiment, we further explore the benefits of community-wide processes by automatically assigning teams based on participants' transactive interaction during deliberation. The results demonstrate advantages in terms of team performance for teams formed based on observed interactions during the community-level deliberation, compared to randomly formed teams. Finally, in a case study, we demonstrate how we successfully adapted the team formation strategy for use in a small MOOC.",

      "abstract": "Baby wearable technologies are becoming increasingly popular, particularly in early infancy. However, little research has been conducted to investigate how baby wearable technologies are adopted and used in parenting. This paper presents a two-week in-depth situated study with six mothers in their homes consisting of contextual entry and exit interviews, video recordings of ‘out-of-box’ experiences, and a diary study. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, participants’ use and expectations of the baby wearable technology were examined. Use of the device directly impacted upon parents’ knowledge production and anxiety, and influenced the perceived physicality and social factors of parenting. We frame these findings around sociological norms of the vulnerable child and responsible mother, as well as the notion of ‘lived informatics,’, where individuals’ interaction with the technology influenced the perception, use and impact of the baby wearable on everyday parenting practices and familial relationships.",

      "abstract": "Recent work has identified a variety of motivations for various forms of technology use and non-use. However, less work has closely examined relationships between those motivations and the experiences of transiting among these different forms of use and non-use. This paper fills that gap by conducting a qualitative interview- and diary-based study where participants were asked to deactivate their Facebook account. An abductive analysis suggests participants' experiences can be organized under the conceptual umbrella of sense of agency, which refers to an individual's perception that their actions are under their own control. The analysis shows how, across disparate motivations, all participants took actions that increased their own subjective sense of agency, regardless of whether they returned to Facebook or not. The discussion applies this conceptual lens to prior studies of technology use and non-use. Doing so shows how sense of agency may provide an organizing orientation for understanding subjective experiences of use and non-use.",

      "abstract": "Many \"sharing economy\" platforms, such as Uber and Airbnb, have become increasingly popular, providing consumers with more choices and suppliers a chance to make profit. They, however, have also brought about emerging issues regarding regulation, tax obligation, and impact on urban environment, and have generated heated debates from various interest groups. Empirical studies regarding these issues are limited, partly due to the unavailability of relevant data. Here we aim to understand service providers of the sharing economy, investigating who joins and who benefits, using the Airbnb market in the United States as a case study. We link more than 211 thousand Airbnb listings owned by 188 thousand hosts with demographic, socio-economic status (SES), housing, and tourism characteristics. We show that income and education are consistently the two most influential factors that are linked to the joining of Airbnb, regardless of the form of participation or year. Areas with lower median household income, or higher fraction of residents who have Bachelor's and higher degrees, tend to have more hosts. However, when considering the performance of listings, as measured by number of newly received reviews, we find that income has a positive effect for entire-home listings; listings located in areas with higher median household income tend to have more new reviews. Our findings demonstrate empirically that the disadvantage of SES-disadvantaged areas and the advantage of SES-advantaged areas may be present in the sharing economy.",

      "abstract": "How can instructors group students into teams that interact and learn effectively together? One strand of research advocates for grouping students into teams with \"good\" compositions such  as skill diversity. Another strand argues for deploying team-building activities to foster interpersonal relations like psychological safety. Our work synthesizes these two strands of research. We describe an experiment (N=249) that compares how team composition vs. team-building activities affect student team outcomes. In two university courses, we composed student teams either randomly or using a criteria-based team formation tool. Teams further performed team-building activities that promoted either team or task outcomes. We collected project scores, and used surveys to measure psychological safety, perceived performance, and team satisfaction. Surprisingly, the criteria-based teams did not statistically differ from the random teams on any of the measures taken, despite having compositions that better satisfied the criteria defined by the instructor. Our findings argue that, for instructors deploying a team formation tool, creating an expectation among team members that their team can perform well is as important as tuning the criteria in the tool. We also found that student teams reported high levels of psychological safety, but these levels appeared to develop organically and were not affected by the activities or compositional strategies tested. We distill these and other findings into implications for the design and deployment of team formation tools for learning environments.",

      "abstract": "In the aftermath of major disasters, governments, aid agencies, and affected populations engage in practices of sense-making to gauge the extent and severity of the crisis, direct response activities, and coordinate recovery planning. To understand the conduct and implications of these practices, we examined the official damage assessment implemented by the Government of Nepal following the April 2015 earthquake. In addition, we undertook participatory mapping to examine the consequences of this assessment in the Langtang Valley, a severely-affected area of the country. We argue that the informatics of post-disaster damage assessment in Nepal played a primary role in narrating the events of the 2015 earthquake, legitimating particular paths toward recovery in the aftermath, and limiting opportunities for alternative configurations of social life that emerge during disasters. Our research demonstrates the ways that forms of sense-making afforded by information technologies play central roles in enacting repair-work following crisis and breakdown.",

The development of a hybrid human-machine framework is motivated by the past success in utilizing human computation to solve problems in medicine and the use of human-machine frameworks in other domains. We describe the methods that decide when and how to escalate the analysis of heart sounds to different resources and incorporate their decision into a final classification. Our framework was tested with a combination of machine classifiers and crowd workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The results indicate a hybrid approach achieves greater performance than a baseline classifier alone, utilizing less expert resources while achieving similar performance, compared to a framework without the crowd.",

Based on results of our formative study, the system offers several features for users to search, browse, filter, and bookmark community-generated help content and to ask questions and clarifications. Furthermore, Social CheatSheet includes embedded curation features for users to generate their own annotated notes and tutorials that can be kept private or shared with the user community. A weeklong deployment study with 15 users showed that users found Social CheatSheet to be useful and they were able to easily both add their own curated content and locate content generated by other users. The majority of users wanted to keep using the system beyond the deployment. We discuss the potential of Social CheatSheet as an application-independent platform driven by community curation efforts to lower the barriers in finding relevant help and instructions.",

At the same time, there are increasing accounts of race and gender bias in evaluations of gig workers, with negative impacts for those workers. We report on a series of four Mechanical Turk-based studies in which participants who rated simulated gig work did not show race- or gender bias, while manipulation checks showed they reliably distinguished between low- and high-quality work. Given prior research, this was a striking result. To explore further, we used a Bayesian approach to verify absence of ratings bias (as opposed to merely not detecting bias). This Bayesian test let us identify an upper- bound: if any bias did exist in our studies, it was below an average of 0.2 stars on a five-star scale. We discuss possible interpretations of our results and outline future work to better understand the results.",
