The  challenge for vehicle intelligence is to satisfy all road users’ mobility needs while keeping them safe and comfortable. Ensuring the safety of  micromobility users (e.g., cyclists and e-scooterists) is particularly tricky,  not only because of their intrinsic vulnerability but also because their  behavior is hard to predict. Maneuvers involving high speed, close  proximity, and multiple threats—such as overtaking when there is  oncoming traffic—are particularly difficult to handle because a tiny human  error may result in a fatality. In order for vehicles to provide support  during overtaking maneuvers (or perform the maneuver themselves), they must be able to predict human behavior accurately and intervene  promptly when necessary, before a human shortcoming can cause harm to any road user. We can combine simulator, test-track, and naturalistic data  to devise models (i.e., algorithms) that can explain to machines how a  [...]",

      "abstract": "New research topics are appearing in the emerging field of urban air mobility (UAM). Successful introduction requires a high level of acceptance in society; this can be achieved by means of user-centered design and by involving citizens in the early stages of development. For immersive user studies, e.g. through user enactment, a physical prototype is helpful - especially since there are currently no drones that can fly on public routes and carry passengers. This project therefore developed a physical, true-to-scale prototype of a passenger drone and enhanced it with in-cabin services and a mobile booking app. Scales, interior design, and service concepts were derived based on related work and own research. The prototype \"FeliFly\" can now visualize several phases of a customer journey and help to investigate acceptance factors as well as expectations and potential problems along a passenger drone flight to derive suggestions for a later real implementation.",

      "abstract": "Creating a diverse and comprehensive dataset of hand gestures for dynamic human-machine interfaces in the automotive domain can be challenging and time-consuming. To overcome this challenge, we propose using synthetic gesture datasets generated by virtual 3D models. Our framework utilizes Unreal Engine to synthesize realistic hand gestures, offering customization options and reducing the risk of overfitting. Multiple variants, including gesture speed, performance, and hand shape, are generated to improve generalizability. Additionally, we simulate different camera locations and types, such as RGB, infrared, and depth cameras, without incurring additional time and cost to obtain these cameras. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework, SynthoGestures, enhances gesture recognition accuracy and can replace or augment real-hand datasets. By saving time and effort in dataset creation, our tool accelerates the development of gesture recognition systems for automotive applications.",

Normally, the driver would manually resolve a situation that the vehicle could not handle and then switch back to full driving automation mode. In this video, however, we focus only on unsuccessful take-over attempts that resulted in collisions and their causes. An expert driver observed and labeled video recordings of 18 unsuccessful take-over attempts out of 216 take-overs, performed in a driving simulator user study. The unsuccessful take-overs were then categorized into five groups in which the driver: 1) did not brake; 2) took over too late; 3) did not take over at all; 4) was too immersed in the secondary task; and 5) had problems with the user interface. The resulting video shows an example of each type of unsuccessful take-over event.",

The video shows results of the collaboration between Virginia Tech, Michigan Tech, and the Volpe National Transportation Center recruited a total of N = 72 younger drivers. Driver simulator testing showed that the IVAA improved driving behavior near HRGCs, improving gaze behavior at HRGCs. Drivers looked both ways at crossings more often when the IVAA was present.

However, it is still unknown what kind of information should be provided in driving scenarios with different risks and how this affects user trust. Driving scenarios based on different risks and Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) with different transparency based on Situation Awareness–Based Agent Transparency (SAT) model were developed to investigate the impact of risk and transparency on user trust using nine simulated fully autonomous drives within a static driving simulator environment. Results showed that driving scenario with lower-risk and HMI with higher-transparency increased user trust-related beliefs and intention to use. And perceived reliability and trust fully mediated the effects of risk and transparency on intention to use. The findings of this study provide insights on HMI transparency under different driving scenarios that may impact user trust.",

      "abstract": "Virtual and mixed reality simulations allow researchers to explore technologies and concepts that are not yet available. In the automotive sector, driving simulators are often used in user studies to investigate the experiences of drivers and passengers in manual and automated driving. However, it is important to also study interactions with other, especially vulnerable, road users (VRUs). User studies can help understand how VRUs interact with vehicles or explore new user interfaces that improve their safety or comfort on the road. Mixed reality simulation is a valuable tool for this purpose, allowing participants to experience potentially dangerous situations without being exposed to physical harm. \r\n    A major improvement to previous VR/MR environments is our ``procedural road generator'' -- a component that allows situations participants encounter to be randomized in a ``controlled'' manner. Study settings are built for this purpose in blocks of predefined road segments, which are arranged in random order one after the other.\r\n    As an application example, we showcase a mixed reality bicycle simulator to study the effects of hazard messages for cyclists in connected traffic in different traffic situations.",

      "abstract": "In contemporary automotive contexts, the growing substitution of physical buttons with digital screens has resulted in a diminished level of sensory feedback associated with physical forms and materials, and rich interaction. In response, this demonstration introduces shape-changing physical buttons that address this limitation. Building upon a material-oriented design exploration \"Trycka\", the buttons were created and seamlessly integrated into the leather fabric of the car interior. These buttons possess temporal forms that enable multi-sensory (haptic and visual) interactive feedforward and feedback. As the development of automated vehicles and intelligent systems progresses, these buttons serve as output compositions of the system, allowing expressivity in the interactions. By presenting experiential prototypes in this demonstration, we provide the automotive community an opportunity to engage with and explore tactile sensations. This paper presents the explorative process of shape-changing buttons and the implications for the automotive industry.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are a disruptive mode of transportation that is rapidly advancing. However, it is widely acknowledged in industry and academia that AVs may not be capable of handling every traffic situation independently, necessitating remote human intervention. Existing teleoperation methods face significant challenges, highlighting the need for innovative remote operation approaches. One such approach is tele-assistance, where remote operators (ROs) offer high-level guidance while delegating low-level controls to automation. Our research focuses on designing a tele-assistance interface. By interviewing 14 AV teleoperation experts and conducting an elicitation study with 17 experienced teleoperators, we identify road scenarios requiring remote human assistance. We then devise a set of discrete high-level commands that enable the resolution of these scenarios without manually controlling AVs. Finally, we integrate these findings into the design of a novel user interface for teleoperating autonomous vehicles.",

However, the design process for In-Vehicle Information Systems (IVISs) lacks data-driven support and effective tools for visualizing and analyzing user interaction data. Therefore, we propose ICEBOAT, an interactive visualization tool tailored to the needs of automotive UX experts to effectively and efficiently evaluate driver interactions with IVIS. ICEBOAT visualizes telematics data collected from production line vehicles, allowing UX experts to perform task-specific analyses. Following a mixed methods User-Centered Design (UCD) approach, we conducted an interview study (N=4) to extract the domain specific information and interaction needs of automotive UX experts and used a co-design approach (N=4) to develop an interactive analysis tool. Our evaluation (N=12) shows that ICEBOAT enables UX experts to efficiently generate knowledge that facilitates data-driven design decisions. ",

The simulator displayed a message indicating the state of approaching vehicles (AV/MV) in a bottleneck scenario, while participants were informed that the MV was controlled by an experimenter using another simulator, despite all trials having the same preprogrammed behaviours. Results showed that the types of AV/MV did not impact participants’ subjective responses. Communication through kinematic cues of the AV/MV was effective, with higher perceived safety, comprehension, and trust reported for approaching vehicles that yielded with an offset away from participants. Perceived safety and trust of the AV were also higher for trials with a light-band external Human Machine Interface (eHMI). This study highlights the value of both explicit and implicit cues for the communication of AVs with other drivers.",

      "abstract": "This demo showcases the integration of a virtual reality (VR) driving simulator with a traffic simulator to enhance usability, improve traffic safety, and optimize traffic flow. By combining these two technologies, an immersive and holistic evaluation platform can be created. The VR driving simulator provides a realistic driving environment that enables users to experience various traffic scenarios, including complex and hazardous situations, in a controlled and safe manner (''me''-perspective). The traffic simulator complements the VR driving simulator by simulating realistic traffic patterns, including vehicle interactions, traffic signals, and road conditions based on statistical models of individualistic driving (''we''-perspective). The integration of these simulators allows for the evaluation of driver performance, decision-making, and reactions within a dynamic and realistic traffic environment. This combined approach offers benefits such as enhanced driver training, assessment of driver behavior, optimization of traffic management strategies, and development of intelligent transportation systems. By leveraging VR technology and traffic simulation, this integrated approach holds significant potential for future mixed traffic challenges.",

In this work, we propose a model-adaptation approach to personalize the training of a CNNLSTM model and improve recognition accuracy while reducing data requirements. Our approach contributes to the field of dynamic hand gesture recognition while driving by providing a more efficient and accurate method that can be customized for individual users, ultimately enhancing the safety and convenience of in-vehicle interactions, as well as driver's experience and system trust. We incorporate hardware enhancement using a time-of-flight camera and algorithmic enhancement through data augmentation, personalized adaptation, and incremental learning techniques. We evaluate the performance of our approach in terms of recognition accuracy, achieving up to 90\\%, and show the effectiveness of personalized adaptation and incremental learning for a user-centered design.",

In this study, we investigated potential empathic triggers in in-vehicle voice-based interactions using the \"co-constructing stories method\" with 11 participants. Our findings suggest that effective empathic triggers possess three characteristics: (1) explainable, (2) definite, and (3) either objective and irresistible or subjective and urgent. We propose a design principle that empathic triggers construct by one Basic element (Reason) and at least one Detail element (Identity, Destination, or Time). Additionally, we discuss drivers’ willingness to share information. This study serves as a foundation for developing design principles that utilize voice to arouse empathy in human-vehicle interactions.",

Yet, little is known about how drivers respond to this, nor how a human-machine interaction (HMI) for them should be designed. This work identifies intervention types associated with an ADS that has change control authority and outlines an experiment method which simulates a deficit in driver situation awareness, enabling the study of their responses to interventions in a controlled environment. In a simulator study (N = 18), it was found that drivers express more negative valence when their control input is blocked (p = .046) than when it is taken away. In safety-critical scenarios, drivers respond more positively to interventions (p = .021) and are willing to give the automation more control (p = .018). An experimental method and HMI design insights are presented and ethical questions about the development of automated driving are provoked. ",

Results show similar types of takeovers between Super Cruise and Autopilot: normal takeover, braking takeover, accelerating takeover, evasive-manoeuvre takeover, and right-swerve takeover (Autopilot only). Context analysis showed that braking takeover which occurred at a normal highway speed was often associated with upcoming highway exits and foreseeable low-speed situations, while accelerating, evasive-manoeuvre, and right-swerve takeovers were caused by strong brake (for Super Cruise) or large steering (for Autopilot) during slow car following. The findings indicate the potential for sensor-based approaches to assessing various contexts and facilitating a more holistic takeover reference model.",

However, for this mode of transportation to gain acceptance, potential passengers must overcome their limited knowledge and concerns about its safety and reliability. To address these challenges, our demonstration shows augmented ego path visualizations of an air taxi above New York City, offering an immersive experience that enhances situational awareness and fosters trust towards UAM. By integrating daytime, night, and foggy weather conditions into the simulation, we bring the experience closer to what passengers may encounter in their actual journeys. Through this demonstration, we contribute to the broader emerging conversation surrounding UAM by emphasizing the importance of situation-aware visualizations in future forms of transportation.",

However, despite significant investment and advances in the technology, potential adopters remain sceptical towards it, with safety, environmental concerns, and practicality presenting the most pressing issues. As several barriers hinder real-life testing of possible solutions, virtual reality (VR) offers a practical tool to explore some of the emerging issues. This demonstration simulates an airport-to-city UAM shuttle, presenting three scenarios with variable weather, cabin interfaces, and abnormal events in a high-fidelity representation of a potential use case. As such, it provides a groundwork for future exploration of UAM acceptance factors in VR studies.  ",

The proposed VR environment allows participants to walk across multiple road lanes, and experience and interact with high fidelity simulated traffic scenarios, including signalized and unsignalized intersections at 1:1 scale, with vehicular traffic making turns, and providing audio feedback.

This can be achieved by communicating confidence or certainty in its current perception or decision. We evaluate different sensory modalities for communicating information about how safely an automated driving system can perform the driving task in critical traffic situations to a driver who is present as a cooperator. We aimed to improve communication between the driving system and the human driver, ultimately increasing the overall driving experience and performance. In a virtual reality driving simulation study with 34 participants, we presented confidence information across three modalities: visual, auditory, and vibrotactile, compared to a baseline condition. Our results indicate that communicating automation uncertainty through the auditory and vibrotactile modalities improved user experience, trust in automation, and perceived safety. At the same time, interactions with the Non-Driving Related Task were reduced by communicating confidence information in critical driving situations.",

      "abstract": "With the prevalence of smart cockpits, passengers spend increasingly more time engaging with non-driving related tasks (NDRTs, e.g., in-vehicle entertainment and meetings) in vehicles. However, prolonged NDRT engagement can cause sensory conflict and result in motion sickness. Previous research found that motion sickness is highly associated with head motion, which can further be influenced by the positions of the NDRT displays. To guide the design of the smart cockpit, this paper examines the impact of four common NDRT display locations on passengers’ motion sickness. A motion transfer function was utilized to translate a real-world vehicle trajectory into head motion when passengers looked at displays at different locations. Then, a 6 Degree-of-Freedom subjective vertical conflict model was adopted to evaluate the motion sickness caused by head motion. The results of this study can inform the design of in-vehicle displays and improve passenger comfort.",

In this work, we investigated the use of augmented reality (AR) windshield displays as a means to improve explainability in safety-critical driving situations. To this end, we conducted a mixed-methods study (VR-based driving simulation combined with a semi-structured interview) with N = 24 participants and evaluated two concepts, containing (1) first-person information about vehicle behavior and (2) additional information about other traffic objects. Results showed that confidence and situational awareness were significantly higher when additional information was presented. The highest scores were achieved when participants were shown \"how & why\" information.",

There has been much research on how to estimate drivers’ affective states, whereas little research has investigated intervention methods that mitigate potential impacts from the driver’s affective states on their driving performance and user experiences. To enhance the development of in-vehicle interfaces considering emotional aspects, we have organized a workshop series to gather automotive user interface experts to discuss this topic at the International ACM Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular Applications (AutoUI). The present paper focuses particularly on the intervention methods created by the experts and proposes design recommendations for future empathic in-vehicle interfaces. We hope this work can spark lively discussions on the importance of drivers’ affective states in their user experience of automated vehicles and pose the right direction.",

We employed a questionnaire and focus groups to examine the perceived trust, safety, and usefulness of older drivers as a heterogeneous\r\nage group (60-80 years old divided into four age groups) and younger (22-25 years old) drivers about Level 3 and the non-driving related tasks (NDRTs) they would perform. The 60-65 group was mostly resistant towards Level 3, whereas the 76-80 group saw it as a\r\nchance to stay mobile. All groups were eager to engage with NDRTs, however, prior to gaining trust they would not engage with highly distracting tasks such as reading. The 76-80 group stressed the importance of designing take over requests that consider their\r\ndecline in physical and cognitive abilities. In this research, we highlight the importance of considering age-related needs in HMI design of Level 3 cars.",

      "abstract": "Smart infrastructures provide the opportunity to study the interaction between traffic participants in various situations like dense or little traffic, daytime or nighttime, sunny or rainy weather, etc. Such a smart infrastructure, a High-Definition-Testfield (HDT), has been set up in Ingolstadt, which allows studying the interaction between traffic participants and user interfaces in intersections. The HDT comprises three highly congested intersections with local sensor technology, i.e., LiDAR scanners and infrared cameras. A part of the HDT has a physical twin on the CARISSMA outdoor facility, allowing to collect data also in critical traffic scenarios, that are rarely observed in real traffic. This work presents the setting to collect data with a focus on critical scenarios and safety use cases. User interfaces for future mobility solutions have to take into account the information from smart infrastructures as well as use cases that can be implemented in such an environment.",

Among them, those robots that have anthropomorphic appearances are the mainstream. As an emerging human-vehicle interaction interface, Augmented Reality Head-Up Display (AR-HUD) still has not been used to showcase in-vehicle virtual robots. For this reason, it is currently unclear what preferences users have for the anthropomorphic appearance of virtual robots when using AR-HUD. In this work, we conducted two experimental online studies focusing on two aspects of anthropomorphic appearance: human similarity and morphological completeness. A total of 257 participants' valid data sets were collected. Participants rated the in-vehicle virtual robot's anthropomorphic appearance on five preference dimensions on Pleasure, Fear, Trust, Comprehensibility, and Acceptance dimensions. We found that users prefer appearances of virtual robots with medium human similarity and high morphological completeness, which aligns with the current theories on robot appearance. Our future research will focus on developing and validating design principles for the appearances of in-vehicle virtual robots.",

The former driver no longer has to intervene in the driving process, monitor it, or respond to take-over requests. At this automation level, vehicle occupants can focus exclusively on non-driving-related tasks. However, passengers might still want to influence driving behavior by choosing a different route or altering travel speed. Therefore, collaborative driving could be a viable option. However, it needs to be clarified how to realize those interactions with the vehicle best, as previous input modalities such as steering wheel and pedals could be left out in the future.\r\nIn a prototyping workshop, we explored different interactions for collaborative driving with automated vehicles. \r\nWe propose two interaction concepts in the accompanying video: 1) a mobile button with a turn and slide function and 2) by shifting weight in the seat to convey the desired intentions.",

These need to be taken into account when designing HMIs to convey vehicle behaviour and intent. In this work, we presented four scenarios where culturally-sensitive HMIs could benefit both drivers and other road users in a cross-cultural setting. This video will hopefully provoke further discussion and research interest in cross-culture human-vehicle interaction.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Fully automated vehicles (SAE level 5) will eliminate the need for a human driver, allowing passengers to focus on non-driving-related activities, such as provided by infotainment services. There has been previous research on using non-driving related content on windshield displays. Still, the placement area is limited and content is likely to be perceptible only from a single viewpoint (perspective issues). Therefore, we propose detaching content from the windshield and instead using an augmented reality space to provide infotainment content for passengers. In a virtual reality within-subject user study (N=19), we examined how passengers would place infotainment content windows (and with which properties) in the open space using VR controllers when sitting in the front of a fully automated vehicle (within-factor: seating position, driver or passenger seat). We further looked into the similarities and differences based on sitting position.\r\n\r\nWe found that most content was not placed on top of windows/the windshield except for video content, which raises the question of whether windshield displays are the right medium for fully automated vehicles. Furthermore, between 40 to 63\\% of content was placed in mirrored positions when comparing between seating positions.",

      "abstract": "Automated shuttle buses promise to bring numerous benefits, particularly for groups of people that are not able to drive themselves, such as senior citizens, teenagers, children and people with disabilities. However, these groups are currently underrepresented in research within the automotive area. In this paper, we conducted user enactments with a diverse range of potential users (N = 48) in terms of age, physical limitations and the intersection of these characteristics. We used a low-fidelity prototype of an automated shuttle bus with adjustable dimensions and seat arrangements and gathered qualitative data to identify specific challenges and needs for ensuring the inclusion of a wide range of individuals in these buses. Our data shows that there is a need to make certain changes, such as a multimodal approach, avoid elevation, and strategically planning of seat distributions, in order to ensure inclusivity.",

      "abstract": " Platooning in automated road transport is a promising method for reducing resource expenses while at the same time increasing efficiency and safety. By leveraging advanced technologies and communication systems, platooning enables vehicles to travel in close proximity, resulting in improved aerodynamics and reduced fuel consumption. While these very pragmatic aspects, on the one hand, show the potential of platooning, on the other hand, human factors issues need to be taken into account. To simulate platooning, we created an interactive demo where participants can experience an automated ride in a platoon. They can adjust the gap to the leading vehicle and see how different distances affect performance metrics. Additionally, a miniaturized-physical and a web-based prototype for learning about the topic of platooning is presented. With this demo, our goal is to provide a hands-on experience of platooning and encourage discussions on the human factors aspects of this novel concept.",

Despite this, we have found that drivers do not use the ADAS to its full potential in everyday use. This is something that has come to our attention. There could be a number of factors at play here. The primary purpose of this workshop is to shed light to the reasons why participants are not activating their ADAS and other comfort functions.

      "abstract": "This workshop aims to design advanced empathic user interfaces for in-vehicle displays, particularly for high-level automated vehicles (SAE level 3 or higher). Incorporating model-based approaches for understanding human emotion regulation, it seeks to enhance the user-vehicle interaction. A unique aspect of this workshop is the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the design process. The workshop will explore generative AI's potential in crafting contextual responses and its impact on user experience and interface design. The agenda includes brainstorming on various driving scenarios, developing emotion-oriented intervention methods, and rapid prototyping with AI tools. The anticipated outcome includes practical prototypes of affective user interfaces and insights on the role of AI in designing human-machine interactions. Through this workshop, we hope to contribute to making automated driving more accessible and enjoyable.",

The Mixed Reality Tool is a novel approach to automotive interior visualization and evaluation using green screens and mixed reality glasses. Utilizing a four-sided green screen arrangement in a studio setup, realistic automotive interiors are visualized, allowing for various evaluations and user interactions by immersing the real individuals into a virtual environment. Two examples are explored: (1) Showcasing the interior of a shared automated vehicle (SAV) and overlaying a real person using Chroma keying. (2) Simulating an automated car interior to analyze the possible transitions and time involved in various Non-Driving Related Activities (NDRA) carried out by real individuals. This innovative approach offers numerous advantages over traditional VR glasses, including improved immersion, realistic integration of real elements, and the ability to conduct evaluations with human presence for enhanced user experience and design optimization.",

The purpose of the guidelines is to manage the unpredictability of computational model-based assistance in unstructured environments in order to reduce user workload. Thus, we conducted a user study to evaluate workload and obtain insights into both the advantages and disadvantages of the computational driver assistance system in order to develop the guidelines. The study utilized a deep learning-based driver assistance method in simulated environments to observe the workload of users while teleoperated driving with the assistance method. Based on the user study, we proposed guidelines for teleoperated driving interface with computational driver assistance systems. We anticipate that the proposed guidelines could improve the understanding of computational driver assistance systems and reduce the workload of teleoperated driving in unstructured environments, thereby enhancing driver's trust as well as comfort.",

      "abstract": "The Box Task combined with a Detection Response Task (BT + DRT) is a relatively less investigated but promising method for evaluating visual-manual and cognitive task demand due to the interaction with in-vehicle information systems while driving. The BT includes the tracking of a dynamic box whose size and position follow a sinusoidal pattern with uniform amplitudes and frequencies. However, it is unclear whether participants are able to predict and adapt to these uniform dynamics, which might lead to a reduced sensitivity of the BT + DRT. Within the present study, it was aimed to examine differences in BT + DRT performance depending on uniform and non-uniform BT dynamics. A laboratory study was conducted with N = 41 participants. The experimental conditions differed in the type and difficulty level of the secondary tasks as well as in the BT dynamics (uniform, varying amplitude, varying frequency). While the uniform BT dynamics could be more predictable, the non-uniform BT dynamics were designed slightly easier in their difficulty using a lower frequency or amplitude. The results revealed no performance benefits when performing uniform BT dynamics compared to non-uniform BT dynamics. The frequency BT condition was related to a significantly lower variability of box position and higher gaze duration on the secondary task compared to the uniform BT dynamics. These findings suggest that participants are not or only negligible able to adapt to the uniform BT dynamics. Therefore, it is recommended to use the uniform BT dynamics as suggested and implemented in previous studies.",

Participants (N=18) situated within an empty van were asked to explore potential designs using physical cardboard prototyping, a commercial software application (Vanspace 3D) for planning van interiors, and an augmented reality application that we developed. Participants were asked to think aloud as they designed van interiors for fictive journeys using each modality. A qualitative evaluation was conducted to assess how participants' conceptualizations of space shifted across the use of each prototyping method. The results demonstrate that each design method influenced design outcomes due to the physicality of the task. This study highlights the importance of considering the role of physicality in the selection of prototyping modality for the design exploration process.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) may use external interfaces, such as LED light bands, to communicate with pedestrians safely and intuitively. While previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of these interfaces in simple traffic scenarios involving one pedestrian and one vehicle, their performance in more complex scenarios with multiple road users remains unclear. The scalability of AV external communication has therefore attracted increasing attention, prompting the need for further investigation. This scoping review synthesises information from 54 papers to identify seven key scalability issues in multi-vehicle and multi-pedestrian environments, with Clarity of Recipients, Information Overload, and Multi-Lane Safety emerging as the most pressing concerns. To guide future research in scalable AV-pedestrian interactions, we propose high-level design directions focused on three communication loci: vehicle, infrastructure, and pedestrian. Our work contributes the groundwork and a roadmap for designing simplified, coordinated, and targeted external AV communication, ultimately improving safety and efficiency in complex traffic scenarios.\r\n",

Bottleneck scenarios, where one of the parts needs to resolve the conflict by yielding priority to the other, could be utilized as a representative ambiguous scenario to understand human behavior in experimental settings. We conducted a controlled field experiment with a Wizard of Oz automated car in a bottleneck scenario. 24 participants attended the study by driving their own cars. They made yielding, or priority-taking decisions based on implicit and explicit locomotion cues on AV realized with an external display. Results indicate that acceleration and deceleration cues affected participants' driving choices and their perception regarding the social behavior of AV, which further serve as ecological validation of related simulation studies.

This study designed a gamified prototype named Dangerous Slime to help drivers maintain SA during automated driving. Dangerous Slime turned surrounding cars into slimes that attacked drivers' cars; drivers need to response to these attacks, which increased their attention to nearby objects. Drivers can take the game as non-driving related tasks (NDRTs) during the whole automated driving process. When compared to NDRT of watching films, the game achieved an improvement in drivers' SA and positive user feedback. Moreover, the styles of games affect drivers' behavior and SA. This study revealed how the game influenced drivers' SA, and took a step toward improving the safety of automated driving in a pleasant way.  ",

This paper focuses on designing and evaluating eHMIs for communication between multiple AVs and pedestrians at multi-lane intersections. \r\nFor this purpose, we analyzed the current situation with traffic signals and future scenarios with eHMIs. We designed an eHMI concept suitable for scenarios with many vehicles and different intersection situations. In an online survey (N=104), we used videos from four test scenarios for a comparative evaluation (baseline: traffic signals). \r\nThe results show that the eHMI concept received higher ratings for user experience and emotional state in some cases, but also highlight the need for consistent behavior across different vehicles, which would be the default with traffic lights.

In this article, we report on the effects of two external human-machine interface (eHMI) types and compare them with no-eHMI as the baseline. A complex mobility scenario was designed by comparing the APMV approach to the pedestrian at 60, 90, and 120 degrees. The pedestrian’s crossing initiation time and eHMI visibility distance were measured in virtual reality with eye-tracking (N=30). Significant differences were found between all variables and participants crossed the road earlier to textual eHMI compared to light bar eHMI. However, when the APMV was approaching from a 90- and 120-degree angle, participants made a faster decision to cross when presented with light bar eHMI. This study highlights the importance of the eHMI type in a complex situation where an APMV is coming from a blind spot. ",

      "abstract": "Cooperative driving has been established as a method to engage the human driver even in higher levels of automated driving, in which human intervention is not strictly necessary. However, a key question regarding a cooperative approach is whether users of automated vehicles even feel the need for cooperative guidance in the vehicles equipped with SAE level 4 and 5 automation, where the human driver is no longer required to intervene. In order to answer this question, we conducted a use case analysis, in which we interviewed (N=16) participants regarding their need for cooperation in different situations. Results show that nearly all participants still wanted to be able to intervene in the driving task, which, however, was dependent on the specific situation. User needs were similarly dependent on the specific situation, while ``Autonomy'', ``Security'', ``Competence'', and ``Relatedness'' emerged as the most important psychological needs.",

However, interaction is a situation where the behaviour of at least two road users could affect each other. To allow real-time interaction between a driver and a pedestrian in a controlled and safe virtual environment, a high-fidelity driving simulator was connected to a CAVE-based pedestrian simulator. We manipulated the crossing locations (i.e., zebra vs no zebra crossing) and the time gaps (i.e., 3,4,5,6,7 seconds) between the pedestrian and the driver. Both pedestrians’ crossing and drivers’ driving behaviour were measured, and pedestrians’ body was tracked using a serious of markers. The whole setup and the manipulation of this study was presented in the video demo.",

Most eHMIs have focused on interaction with pedestrians at crossings. However, these may not work for cyclists, who can be anywhere around vehicles and encounter them in diverse traffic scenarios. We used participatory design with cyclists and AutoUI researchers (N=12) collaborating in a real-world setting to design eHMIs around an actual vehicle. Participants preferred eHMIs that co-exist with traditional vehicle signals and use a single design language across traffic scenarios to communicate awareness and intent quickly without distracting their attention from the road. We used our findings to develop a taxonomy of eHMI features for cyclists, allowing us to synthesise the designs and contribute versatile eHMI concepts catered to cyclists' needs. This is important to ensure AVs can safely navigate and interact with cyclists in all road scenarios.",

Thirty-two participants drove a simulator with air-gesture menu navigation tasks. A 4x2 mixed-model design was used to explore the effects of auditory displays as a within-subjects variable (earcons, auditory icons, spearcons, and no-sound) and menu-generation interfaces as a between-subjects variable (fixed and adaptive) on driving performance, secondary task performance, eye glance, and user experience. The adaptive condition centered the menu around the user's hand position at the moment of activation, whereas the fixed condition located the menu always at the same position. Results demonstrated that spearcons provided the least visual distraction, least workload, best system usability and was favored by participants; and that fixed menu generation outperformed adaptive menu generation in driving safety and secondary task performance. Findings will inform design guidelines for in-vehicle air-gesture interaction systems. ",

However, there is currently no validated instrument to measure perceived security in this context, and little research has been done to determine the factors that contribute to perceived security. We propose the Perceived Security Scale for Shared Automated Vehicles (PSSAV), a questionnaire that assesses various aspects of perceived security in SAVs. The scale was evaluated using an exploratory, data-driven approach in a pilot study with 60 German participants, and a main study with 114 German and 101 Colombian participants experiencing a positive or negative ride in an automated shuttle bus (between-subjects design) presented as videos in an online study. The results suggest that trust, privacy, and control are key factors that influence security in the context of SAVs. The PSSAV questionnaire is reliable and sensitive to manipulation, indicating its construct validity.",

      "abstract": "Modern vehicles are equipped with advanced sensors and capabilities, yet engaging human drivers effectively in hazard perception remains a challenging research area. This paper investigates the potential of mixed reality (MR) to enhance driver warning systems. The study examines the impact of attention-shifting methods, including visual cues, audio cues, and a combination of both, on drivers' hazard perception. A preliminary study involving six participants was conducted, and the NASA-TLX analysis did not yield significant differences. However, through the use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we unveil distinct brain activation patterns associated with visual and sound cues. Further research with larger sample sizes and diverse driving scenarios is required to validate and expand upon these preliminary results.",

This study aims to empirically evaluate the speed regulation n-back task, a tool to manipulate MW using a modification of the standard n-back task. Our experiment involved 23 participants who experienced a 0-back and 2-back driving condition, with task-irrelevant novel environmental sounds used to elicit P3a event-related potentials. Results indicate that the 2-back condition was perceived as more demanding, evidenced by higher NASA-TLX scores (overall score, mental and temporal demand, effort, frustration). The mean P3a amplitude was diminished during the 2-back condition compared to the 0-back condition, suggesting that drivers experienced higher MW and had fewer resources available to process the novel environmental sounds. This study provides empirical evidence indicating that the speed regulation n-back task could be a valid and effective method for manipulating MW in driving research.",

The majority of measures considers the multidimensionality of the construct including the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). However, the UEQ neglects that the individual UX-components might be of unequal importance to different cultures. Therefore, the aim of this contribution was to gain first insights on what users from different countries, i.e., China, Germany, and the United States, cherish in an automotive user interface (UI) using the six factors provided by the UEQ. The results indicated that participants from different cultural backgrounds preferred different UI-qualities. Based on the findings, we compiled some initial thoughts on how to consider cultural differences both in the design of an automotive UI as well as in the methodological approach. We raise the question whether a weighting scheme for the UEQ is worth considering in cross-cultural UX-research.",

Instead of in field experiments, such systems could be tested in safe and more controlled simulated environments; however, their validity needs verification. \r\nWe evaluated the validity of mixed reality (MR) simulation for bicycle support systems notifying of dooring hazards. In a mixed-design study (N=43) with environment type(MR/test track) as within and hazard notifications (with/without) as between factor, comparing subjective and objective measures across environments. \r\nIn conclusion, MR simulation is absolutely valid for user experience and perceived safety and relatively valid for workload, standard deviation of lateral position, and speed. However, MR simulation was not valid for lateral distance, as participants cycled more in the center of the street than on the test track, perhaps to avoid simulator sickness. Thus, we conclude that MR simulation is valuable for studying bicycle safety.",

Warning systems should warn of the situation's urgency, which can be achieved using Machine Learning~(ML)-based VRU detection models. ML models and eHMI interaction concepts are usually developed by different teams and tested separately, often resulting in integration problems. This work contributes to a low-code approach to model interaction concepts involving ML models to enable end-to-end prototypes for early integration and User eXperience~(UX) testing. We use flow-based modeling with Node-RED, the virtual driving simulator CARLA and YOLOv5 as state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for VRU detection. We show two scenarios (cornering lights and context-aware VRU warning) in an interactive demonstrator, meaning a manual live control of pedestrian and car. We consider our approach to model and evaluate interaction concepts without writing code feasible for non-computer scientists. ",

      "abstract": "Appropriate monitoring and successfully intervening when automation fails is one of the most critical issues in level 2 automated driving, since drivers suffer from low situation awareness when using such systems. To counter, we present a gamified in-vehicle interface based on ideas from previous work, where drivers have to support the vehicle by pointing at other traffic objects in the environment. We hypothesized that this system could help drivers in the monitoring task, maintain their situation awareness, and result in lower crash rates. We implemented a prototype of this system and evaluated it in a lab study with N=20 participants. The results indicate that participants were looking more intensively at lead vehicles and performed stronger braking actions. However, there was no measurable benefit on situation awareness and intervention performance in critical situations. We conclude by discussing differences to related experiments and present future ideas. ",

To address this, we designed a controlled, outdoor car driving circuit where drivers (N=27) drove and encountered pedestrian confederates who performed non-verbal positive or non-positive road crossing actions towards them. Our findings reveal that drivers reported higher valence upon observing positive, non-verbal crossing actions, and higher arousal upon observing non-positive crossing actions. Drivers' heart signals (BVP, IBI and BPM), skin conductance and facial expressions (brow lowering, eyelid tightening, nose wrinkling, and lip stretching) all varied significantly when observing positive and non-positive actions. Our car driving study, by drawing on realistic driving conditions, further contributes to the development of in-vehicle empathic interfaces that leverage behavioural and physiological sensing. Through automatic inference of driver affect resulting from pedestrian actions, our work can enable novel empathic interfaces for supporting driver emotion self-regulation.",

The system does not require direct intervention from the driver and is based on the analysis of context data. The classifier was trained and tested on real data (615 car trips) collected by 9 test users. With this research, we contribute (i) by providing a literature review on cruising detection, (ii) by proposing an approach to model cruising behavior, and (iii) by describing the design, training, and testing of the classifier and discussing its results. In the long term, our work aims to improve user experience and safety in car-related contexts by relying on human-centered features that implicitly understand users' behavior and anticipate their needs.",

However, with careful design, VR devices have the potential to mitigate motion sickness and provide immersive experiences while travelling. We propose a novel implicit motion cue for manipulating a virtual display presented in Virtual and Extended Reality. Our design mitigates motion sickness by providing awareness of physical orientation changes through changes in the visual orientation of the virtual planar content. We performed two experiments on a rotating chair, testing mitigation properties of different levels of rotational gain applied to the display. Our results showed that the technique significantly reduced motion sickness, without negatively affecting task performance. Our findings show that we can subtly interleave motion cues in existing spatial content like planar displays and this can contribute to lessening motion sickness experienced.",

Advanced driver distraction warnings prompt drivers through different modalities to keep their attention on the road. With added driving automation, research suggests that drivers tend to be distracted and take their eyes off the road more often. To increase safety, distraction warnings will be used in conjunction with driving automation. However, there is no empirical evidence on how drivers’ altered gaze behavior affects the occurrence of distraction warnings when adding automation. In the present driving simulator study, N=22 participants performed use cases that triggered distraction warnings while driving in different automation modes. Results showed that warnings were most frequently triggered by long glances away from the roadway. Furthermore, it became evident that the warning frequency differed, depending on the automation mode. Finally, future research on advanced driver distraction warnings is outlined.",

Nevertheless, at least in the near foreseeable future, it seems that AVs will not be able to resolve every problem they encounter and thus, there will be a need for human involvement in the form of remote vehicle teleoperation. However, it is still unclear how such a teleoperation station should be designed and which views should be presented to the teleoperator. In this study, we examine the effect of a bird's eye view (BEV) on situation awareness in tele-driving.  We compare a regular frontal view with two different arrangements of BEV added to the frontal view. Our findings indicate that adding a BEV does not improve the situation awareness of the tele-driver, and in some cases, even makes it more difficult for the user to perceive some important environmental features.",

      "abstract": "Urban air mobility has attracted a lot of attention recently and will become more and more prevalent and established as a new form of mobility in the coming years. However, it should not be ignored that numerous people are skeptical of new technologies and reject them. This applies in particular to safety-critical areas such as (autonomous) flying. To address concerns and identify acceptance criteria, we have created this demo setup. The demo allows the viewer to experience different flight scenarios (day/night; normal/rain/snow/fog) in a true-to-scale mock-up of a passenger drone. This demonstrator will provide insight into this future transportation option, creating a space for open discussion.  ",

      "abstract": "In this demonstration, we present novel interaction modalities and use cases for AutoVis, a tool for the mixed-immersive analysis of automotive user interface (AUI) interaction studies. AutoVis uniquely enables exploration of AUI studies' multilayered spatio-temporal interplay between humans, vehicles, and their surroundings by combining a non-immersive desktop view with a virtual reality view. It facilitates the analysis of passenger behavior, physiology, spatial interactions, and events within replications of study environments, employing avatars, trajectories, and heatmaps. To extend AutoVis and streamline interactions with it, we created a novel concept for gaze and gesture-supported analysis control. In addition, we conducted an exemplary use case study in the context of traffic accident reconstructions to explore the applicability of AutoVis apart from AUIs. By demonstrating these extensions, we contribute to the underexplored area of immersive analytics for AUIs and promote a more efficient and effective understanding of human-vehicle interaction.",

This paper focuses on the role of empathy, particularly cognitive and affective empathy, as a potential mitigator of negative emotional states. We investigated how empathic responses from an in-vehicle agent influence a driver's emotional state and their driving performance through a between-subject simulation study. Thirty participants were assigned one of three in-vehicle agents: cognitive empathy style, affective empathy style, and non-empathy style agent. They drove using a driving simulator and received empathic responses from in-vehicle agents when adverse events happened. The results showed that affective empathy style in-vehicle agent more helped driver drive safely with lower negative affect states compared to cognitive empathy style agent and no agent. We expect that the findings of this study could provide valuable insight for designing empathic interactions between a driver and a vehicle.",

      "abstract": "With the continual growth of new technology in modern day vehicles, more applications are being implemented in these complex devices. These applications push various notifications and messages to the driver from a variety of sources such as audio, communication or vehicle state related. While attending to these messages, which include reading and sometimes response, drivers must decide how to manage their attention. This involves moving their eyes from the forward roadway to attend to content located within the vehicle. To understand the impact of location message presentation by the vehicle on driver attention and task performance, we evaluated four different Human Machine Interface configuration locations. The results from a simulator study (N=22) indicate that center screen location reduces drivers' attention to the road when compared to both the instrument cluster and Head Up Display locations. Additionally, we also highlight some benefits of using attention-based metrics over distraction-based metrics.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a data review conducted as part of a study commissioned by the Queensland Government, focusing on enhancing transportation and mobility access for people with disabilities (PwDs) through the development of design principles for accessible autonomous vehicles (AAVs). Existing literature highlights the challenges faced by PwDs, including limited mobility, social exclusion, and the violation of their human rights due to transportation barriers. However, autonomous vehicle future holds promise in providing tailored and accessible transport options, leading to improved access to healthcare, employment, social inclusion, and safety for PwDs. This data review examines available numerical and metric data research, identifying key areas for designing accessible AVs, such as anthropometric percentiles for wheeled mobility users, floor space requirements, ramp angles, interior layouts, and door dimensions. However, further research is needed in co-design prototyping, analysis of standards, and current design best practices. The overall research aims to establish a comprehensive set of design principles for AAVs that cater to the diverse needs of PwDs, including individuals with visual impairments, hearing impairments, mobility limitations, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and the elderly. The review concludes by discussing information clusters, data gaps, and opportunities for future research in the field of accessible autonomous vehicle design.",

      "abstract": "With the introduction of autonomous vehicles, pedestrians may no longer expect explicit communication from drivers. Despite the anticipated safety benefits of anthropomorphic human–machine interfaces (HMIs) for pedestrian crossings, the impact of different levels of anthropomorphism and communication on pedestrian safety remains insufficiently understood. We proposed a virtual-agent (VA) HMI that mimics driver behavior and investigated pedestrians’ preferences through augmented reality (AR) experiments. Eighteen participants made decisions about crossing after receiving cues about the vehicle’s intentions from VA HMIs. Participants preferred the \"characterized\" VA HMI owing to its aesthetically pleasing design and found the \"eye contact + hand gesture\" combination to be more easily comprehensible. We found that while the degree of anthropomorphism did not significantly affect pedestrians’ crossing decisions, more explicit communication was helpful. Our study provides empirical evidence regarding users’ experiences of HMI in AR and the effectiveness of VA HMIs that imitate driver communication modes.",

This includes demonstrating how the system can identify elements of driver state; driver distractions, fatigue, and unresponsiveness. Whilst visual distractions have been detailed extensively, cognitive distraction has received less attention within these protocols. Part of the reason for this could be the lack of understanding or general consensus on cognitive distraction within the context of driver state. For example, how do we assess driver state, how do we develop ground truths, how much distraction should be considered too much, and what is and is not considered cognitive? To answer these questions, workshop participants will focus on the methods and metrics used to assess cognitive load and the impact this has on driver state and performance; whether during manual driving, monitoring an automated vehicle, or during takeovers after periods of automation.

The goal of this workshop is to address the current lack of data sharing practices and to promote a culture of openness. By discussing barriers to data sharing, defining best practices, and exploring open data formats, we aim to foster collaboration, improve data quality, and promote transparency. Special interest groups will be formed to identify parameter sets for recurring research topics, so that data collected in different individual studies can be used to generate insights beyond the results of the individual studies.

The participants experienced three different conditions in separate sessions: 1) control condition without countermeasure, 2) drive with active seat belt tensioner, 3) drive with a two-step driving profile. The participants rated their motion sickness on the MSTT Scale (during the drive) and on the MSAQ (pre and post drive). After each drive, drivers rated their subjective experience of vehicle behavior and the countermeasures. On MSTT, the results showed no significant differences in the development of motion sickness across the three conditions. However, the two-step driving profile reduced the development of motion sickness assessed via MSAQ. Furthermore, both countermeasures seem to have the potential to positively influence the perception of the automation as safer, more trustworthy and more reliable.",

This Extended Abstract presents EcoSimLab, a driving simulator environment for rapid prototyping, testing and evaluation of energy interface and eco assistance design concepts as well as for comprehensive studies on eco-driving behavior and further facets of user-energy interaction. We present the system architecture based on BeamNG.tech, initial data on usability and energy model validity, and we discuss future enhancements and potential applications of EcoSimLab. ",

      "abstract": "We employed the ‘Ghost Driver’ methodology to emulate an autonomous vehicle (AV) and explored pedestrians’ (n=520) crossing behaviour in response to external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs). Three eHMI designs were created to replace absent pedestrian-driver communication; each had different anthropomorphic elements and were identified as ‘explicit’, ‘implicit’ and ‘low’ to reflect the conspicuity of anthropomorphism. They were displayed on an LED matrix and strip mounted to the front of a Nissan Leaf vehicle, which was driven around the University campus over 5 days. Video analysis highlighted differences in pedestrians’ behaviour, with the explicit anthropomorphism eHMI extending crossing time and attracting more visual attention. Additionally, some pedestrians continued to use gestures, ostensibly to indicate their intention to cross or to thank the vehicle, despite the absence of a visible driver. While preliminary findings support the application of anthropomorphism in AV-pedestrian communications, further research will explore designs in more controlled, experimental settings.",

We then describe we describe the AV-ERU ecosystem and identify key information modes that encapsulate potential interaction scenarios, such as states, intent, and responses of AVs. We outline the elements of the design space, including the interfaces, interactors and agents, modalities of interaction, and design considerations. We apply the design space to some scenarios and map existing standards to demonstrate the use of our scenario-based approach and design space as a comprehensive tool for future standards development. We highlight the need for collaborative efforts among stakeholders to expedite and reduce bias in the establishment of standards.

However, passenger concerns about safety and information provision must be addressed through an internal Human Machine interface (HMI) that displays information and allows communication with remote supervisors. By conducting an online survey, this study aims to investigate passenger’s preferences on HMI designs. The survey required participants to rate four HMI elements (text, humanoid voice, supervisor’s voice, and supervisor’s voice and face) under seven scenarios in three aspects: sense-of-safety, trust, and necessity. The opinions of 324 frequent bus users were collected. The results indicated that using texts and humanoid voice to display information is sufficient in normal situations. Regarding communication during abnormal situations, while presenting the supervisor’s face can increase the sense-of-safety and trust, participants reported sufficient necessity with supervisor’s voice only. These findings can provide useful insights for parameterizing internal HMIs of automated buses.",

The need to teach electric car owners about their car's performance has thus emerged. This paper investigates how to coach users of electric vehicles to drive more energy efficiently while simultaneously enhancing the driving experience by utilizing a smartphone and an in-car application. By collecting data about the user group and the contexts, the understanding of Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) drivers has deepened. Based on the findings, prototypes were developed and evaluated iteratively with users, enabling further investigation into their needs. This resulted in ten design recommendations, addressing three domains: Feedback, Usability, and Device.",

With this work, we aim to systemically investigate cognitive biases in the context of automated driving for the first time. Using an online study (\\textit{N} = 99) and a short experiment (\\textit{N} = 21), we investigated two exemplary cognitive biases (1. illusion of control and 2. automation bias). Our results suggest that both can occur during automated driving. Specifically, we found that not only a greater amount of information about vehicle behavior but also the humanization of this information can lead to an (illusory) higher sense of control.",

      "abstract": "Performing non-driving-related tasks as car passenger reduces visual perception of surroundings, which may cause a conflict with the human vestibular system and thus lead to motion sickness. Augmented reality head-mounted displays offer a possible solution to this phenomenon by presenting digital content at head level as opposed to common displays placed on one's lap, keeping the peripheral vision intact. However, technical limitations such as end-to-end latency of video see-through devices may counteract this advantage. Therefore, we investigated a mobile office scenario by comparing video see-through augmented reality to a traditional laptop setup with regard to motion sickness and task performance in a moving car. Our results suggest similar responses to motion sickness between conditions, with limited effects on task performance and improved ergonomics when using augmented reality.",

      "abstract": "In conditionally automated driving, assertive takeover requests (TORs) have been found to elicit faster responses in the transition from automated to manual control. However, despite this apparent benefit, concerns have been raised that assertive signals can stress the drivers, resulting in worse takeover quality and subsequent driving performance.\r\n\r\nTo investigate the phenomenon, we conducted a driving simulator study exploring the effects of assertive and non-assertive TOR signals. In a series of tasks where the drivers were required to take over control of the vehicle to manually maneuver a critical situation, immediate and sustained measures of driving performance, stress, and subjective perceptions were compared.\r\n\r\nConsistent with previous research, the assertive signal led to shorter reaction times and stronger braking. However, no other immediate or delayed differences in the measures were observed. These findings suggest that assertive TOR signals might be a preferable design option, however, the phenomenon should be further explored.   ",

However, this information is often only available to front-seat passengers while being restricted to in-car displays. To propose a more natural way of interacting with the environment, we implemented an augmented reality head-mounted display to overlay points of interest onto the real world. We aim to compare multiple selection techniques for digital objects located outside a moving car by investigating head gaze with dwell time, head gaze with hardware button, eye gaze with hardware button, and hand pointing with gesture confirmation. Our study was conducted in a moving car under real-world conditions (N=22), with significant results indicating that hand pointing usage led to slower and less precise content selection while eye gaze was preferred by participants and performed on par with the other techniques.\r\n",

A study was conducted using a human-centered design process consisting of five stages to design a prototype that aids older adults with AMD to maintain situational awareness and control while riding in a highly or fully AV. The prototype includes a voice-activated navigation system with three levels of detail, a 360◦\r\nin-vehicle camera, a retractable microphone, and physical buttons on the console-side of the right and left front seats to manually activate the navigation system. These features are designed to help passengers with low vision to travel with a necessary level of situational awareness and remain in control during the ride.",

      "abstract": "An increasing number of traffic accidents are being caused by distracted driving, including mind wandering (MW). Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are equipped with a variety of support features aimed at reducing these safety issues. However, given that AVs on the road are not fully autonomous human drivers are still required to be ready to takeover where the system encounters limitations. As such, it becomes vital to study the driver's mental state during the takeover process. Signal displays have been confirmed as an effective means of alerting drivers to takeover requests, yet there remains a paucity of studies investigating the effectiveness of multimodal displays in autonomous vehicles. This study aims to explore the impacts of mind wandering and takeover performance in partially automated vehicles, and how multimodal displays (comprising visual (V), tactile (T), and VT elements) can effectively notify drivers of a takeover request. A human subject experiment will be implemented, and the insights garnered from this study will guide the future design of AVs, while also contributing to the development of a mental model to predict drivers’ mental states and counteract instances of mind wandering.",

Such a shift in in-vehicle activity suggests vehicle interior spaces should provide an adequate manner by considering users' affective desires. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the affective role of future vehicle interiors. Thirty-one participants in ten focus groups were interviewed about challenges they face regarding their current vehicle interior and expectations they have for future vehicles. Results from content analyses revealed the affective role of future vehicle interiors. Advanced exclusiveness and advanced convenience were two primary aspects identified. The identified affective roles of each aspect are a total of eight visceral levels, four visceral levels each, including focused, stimulating, amused, pleasant, safe, comfortable, accommodated, and organized. We expect the results from this study to lead to the development of affective vehicle interiors by providing the fundamental knowledge for developing conceptual direction and evaluating its impact on user experiences.",

      "abstract": "As the development of mixed reality (MR) technology continues to progress, the range of applications and purposes within vehicles and for road users is expanding. MR holds the potential to enhance road safety, enable drivers to engage in non-driving related tasks (NDRTs), and improve passenger experiences. Moreover, the utilization of head/helmet-mounted displays (HMDs) with MR technology for cyclists can augment their vision and contribute to the safety of both cyclists and pedestrians. Furthermore, MR can play a crucial role in facilitating the transition towards automated driving. Nevertheless, there remain several challenges associated with the application of MR in vehicles, as well as human factors issues that require resolution. Additionally, virtual reality (VR) has the capability to immerse passengers in virtual worlds, offering opportunities for enjoyable passenger experiences. Presently, most MR research primarily focuses on individual users at a particular point along the reality-virtuality continuum. In this workshop, we will examine the potential, limitations, impact, role, and suitability of MR in driving applications and simulations. This will encompass topics such as holistic MR experiments, transitional interfaces, and HMDs specifically designed for cyclists. The primary objective of this workshop is to establish a research agenda for the application of MR utilized by road users over the next 3 to 5 years and beyond.",

The move from drivers to passengers who will engage in non-driving related tasks as\r\nwell as the potential change in the layout of the car interior that will come with automated vehicles are expected to result in a\r\nworsened experience of motion sickness. The previous workshop [ 18] highlighted the need for consensus on guidelines regarding\r\nstudy design for motion sickness research. Hence, this workshop will develop a guide for motion sickness research through reflection\r\nand discussions on the current methodologies used by experts in the field. Further it will build on the knowledge collected from the\r\nprevious workshop and will thereby facilitate not only new research ideas and fruitful collaborations but also find a consensus in the\r\nfield in regard to study design and methodologies",

In order to extend the system's capabilities, this work firstly investigates a possible detection of driver fainting via an interior sensing camera. An approach that supports the simulation of driver fainting is developed and realized in a parked vehicle as well as during manual and automated driving, with 61 participants in total. Moreover, multiple instructed intentional movements with for- and side-ward movements of the body are recorded. Classification models are developed based on features that are derived from head and body pose data. These models are then applied to the complete video streams that include various waiting and driving scenarios. The best classification results are seen with Random Forest classifiers with up to 84\\% true positive detections and 0.33~false positive detections per hour. The majority of false positive detections were seen during automated driving. Implications and options for future research are discussed.",

Experiments so far did not include embodied agents. In this work, we present two potential analogies derived from a company hierarchy and a spaceship crew. We developed comic strips showing everyday interactions with these agentsin an automated vehicle and evaluated them in a Vignette study in comparison with single-agent approaches. Our results suggest that a multi-agent approach could be beneficial for trust calibration, but only for the company and not the spaceship analogy. Only some of the design decisions regarding the agents’ personalities worked out as intended. Still, we believe the concept is promising for future investigations.",

Research on connected vehicles has suggested that the awareness of traffic flow in chain braking scenarios can improve traffic safety. Thus, in a video simulation experiment, we explored the safety benefits and users’ acceptance of two windshield-displayed V2V-communication-based HMIs that inform the chain braking events, one with streaming video from the camera in front of the DLV (vHMI) and the other with warning sign informing chain braking events (sHMI). We found that both HMIs improved drivers' understanding of the situation and reduced reaction time and braking response time (BRT) compared to that of the baseline condition (without HMIs). Further, users reported higher usability and satisfaction with sHMI. This research highlights the benefits of providing front-traffic information to drivers in chain braking scenarios.",

This online pilot study (N = 242) evaluated the perception of binaural auditory cues and concurrent visual animations about overtaking vehicles designed to improve drivers’ situational awareness. The results showed that the spatial direction of the sounds was perceived in a high degree of precision, and they were rated as pleasant and natural sounding. Spatial congruency between the two information modalities was accurately perceived with visualizations rated as significantly more reliable blind spot indicators than sounds. The results suggest that spatial direction of binaural sounds can be consistently interpreted both alone and in tandem with visualizations in the given driving scenario. Binaural sounds could enhance drivers’ situational awareness in an eyes-free way to anticipate overtaking vehicles already before they trigger visual blind spot warnings.",

      "abstract": "As the adoption of automated vehicles becomes more prevalent, there is a need for systematic approaches to understanding, communicating, and analyzing the design aspects of the technology. Designing a taxonomy—a hierarchical framework that classifies and organizes design elements and features—is a critical tool in this pursuit. A well-defined taxonomy provides an effective communication tool and enables stakeholders to understand, discuss, and compare system designs. However, current taxonomies often fail to consider technological advancements and the needs of stakeholders. This gap limits the understanding of vehicle automation and hinders addressing critical aspects such as safety and social impact. This workshop aims to propose a stakeholder-centred taxonomy for automated vehicles, taking into consideration the perspectives and requirements of different stakeholder groups, such as technology professionals, policymakers, and end-users. The workshop aims to identify relevant considerations for taxonomy design that cater to different stakeholders, incorporate diverse perspectives, and highlight opportunities and challenges for effective communication and decision-making in vehicle automation.",

      "abstract": "The sense of presence is commonly defined as the recipient’s subjective sense of being there in a virtual environment. In the context of HCI research in traffic, virtual reality methods as well as simulators of all kinds, including driving simulators, bicycle simulators or pedestrian simulators, are part of the standard research repertoire today. In these simulated traffic environments, it is usually the aim to produce a realistic impression of the corresponding real-world situation, creating a high sense of presence as well as realistic driving behavior. Throughout the course of the presented workshop, we intend to collect measures and exchange views about methods which can be applied to increase the sense of presence in driving simulation, avoiding so called \"breaks in presence\". Different measures to increase presence shall be generated and evaluated by the workshop participants. We further seek to discuss different components of presence, and how these relate to various types of simulation, as well as simulation validity. Summarizing, the present workshop aims to establish current knowledge regarding the concept of presence, while identifying promising future measures to increase the sense of presence in simulated traffic environments.",

In this work, we investigated the effect of variable and different fixed focus distances on male participants’ performance during perceptual distance matching of seven target distances between 6 and 24 meters from the driver’s position. In Study 1, 44 male participants completed the task with a variable and a fixed focal plane at 15 meters. In Study 2, 44 male participants completed the task with fixed focal planes at 6, 10, 12 and 24 meters. While the results are limited by the male-only samples, matching target distances closer than 15 meters was generally less accurate with fixed focus distances. Distances beyond 15 meters were matched most accurately with a fixed focal plane at 10 meters. However, results from subjective evaluation were in favor of the variable focal plane.",

      "abstract": "There are several methods to design for positive user experiences (PUX). However, when it comes to technology-push innovations, identifying relevant user activities where the application of novel technologies can truly enable PUX is challenging. The workshop format is based on an innovative method – the \"Inspiration Matrix\" [2]. The method aims to systematically identify user activities in which the technology has the potential to deliver exceptional PUX. It does so by combining technology functions with specific user activity, allowing applicants to foster their creativity systematically. We invite researchers and practitioners to join us in this interactive workshop, where we apply the Inspiration Matrix to develop PUX potentials of novel interaction technologies for next-generation vehicles, using the ProTable projection technology [3] as an example. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the workshop's goals, schedule, and activities, with a focus on the anticipated outcomes that will drive future advancements in the field.",

      "abstract": "Locating out-of-view vehicles can help pedestrians to avoid critical traffic encounters. Some previous approaches focused solely on visualising out-of-view objects, neglecting their localisation and limitations. Other methods rely on continuous camera-based localisation, raising privacy concerns. Hence, we propose the ARcoustic system, which utilises a microphone array for nearby moving vehicle localisation and visualises nearby out-of-view vehicles to support pedestrians. First, we present the implementation of our sonic-based localisation and discuss the current technical limitations. Next, we present a user study (n=18) in which we compared two state-of-the-art visualisation techniques (Radar3D, CompassbAR) to a baseline without any visualisation. Results show that both techniques present too much information, resulting in below-average user experience and longer response times. Therefore, we introduce a novel visualisation technique that aligns with the technical localisation limitations and meets pedestrians' preferences for effective visualisation, as demonstrated in the second user study (n=16). Lastly, we conduct a small field study (n=8) testing our ARcoustic system under realistic conditions. Our work shows that out-of-view object visualisations must align with the underlying localisation technology and fit the concrete application scenario.",

Most safety models are validated both in simulation and during on-road tests. However, first-hand experiences and analysis of ADS safety models are not easily accessible to the general research community. This paper introduces the RSS driving demonstrator an open-source simulation tool that enables first-hand experience of the Responsibility Sensitive Safety\r\n(RSS) safety model proposed by Intel and Mobileye and adopted by several Automotive Industry standards and regulatory frameworks. The RSS demonstrator enables first-hand interactions and experience of ADS safety model restrictions in both automated and manual driving conditions. As a User Experience (UX) tool, it provides quantitative safety metrics and flexible user interaction features. The results indicate it served to both evangelize the RSS ADS safety model with laymen population and is a versatile tool for Automotive UX development.",

      "abstract": "With the rising popularity of electrified vehicles, emphasis has been placed on encouraging charging with renewable energy and maximizing battery longevity to improve vehicle sustainability. Many mobile applications offer tools to suggest charging times with more sustainable renewable energy and charging strategies that preserve battery health.  However, these options often result in longer, less convenient charging times for drivers.  Here we conducted three charging scenario studies to identify factors that influence willingness to wait for sustainable charging.  Participants selected between faster but less sustainable charging options and slower charging options that either reduce charging emissions or improve battery longevity.  We find people's willingness to wait for green energy is influenced by situational factors; further we find that information and battery longevity interventions can increase willingness to wait for sustainable charging.  Finally, we provide design recommendations to promote sustainably in charging behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Camera-based driver monitoring systems (DMS) are a mature technology capable of reliably detecting a wide range of driver behaviours and states [3, 7]. However, fully realising the safety potential of DMS requires accurate monitoring to be paired with effective human-machine interfaces (HMI) in order to facilitate behavioural change when risky behaviours or unsafe driver states are detected. Further, increasing levels of driving automation pose challenges for researchers and manufacturers in determining how automated components of the vehicle system should react when such states are detected. This workshop will address the issue of DMS-HMI integration by providing a space for collaborators to identify and discuss key emerging issues for driver monitoring and HMI response. The organisers will present an introduction to DMS concepts and industry standards, and outline the challenge of implementing DMS in both manual and assisted driving environments in a way that maximises safety outcomes. Presenters will provide a primer on relevant HMI design approaches in order to support a Q&A panel followed by small group discussions on leading current and prospective DMS-HMI design considerations. This includes discussing a ground-up approach to safe and acceptable alerting strategies. The organisers will combine industry and academic perspectives and create space for collaborative problem solving with attendees. The organisers intend to share outcomes of the workshop (such as problems identified & proposed solutions) with a broader academic audience.",

Future AVs will continue to offer the possibility to drive manually, potentially leading to challenging driver-initiated takeovers (DITs) due to the \"out-of-the-loop problem\" and reduced driving performance. A driving simulator study (N=24) was conducted to explore whether cooperative systems, without full control of driving tasks, provide a sense of control to mitigate DITs in varying conflict situations. Conflict levels were operationalized by an AV performing overtaking maneuvers under free, 100m, and 50m visibility on a two-lane rural road. Participants experienced three systems: no intervention-, a cooperative choice-, and a manual control system. Results showed that participants had a similar sense of control with the cooperative system compared to the manual one and preferred it over the manual system. The likelihood of DITs increased with conflict intensity, and trust in the AV moderated the conflict-DIT association.",

These decisions, prone to human error, can compromise road safety and driving efficiency. The recent advancements in augmented reality (AR) glasses hold significant potential for assisting drivers in avoiding such dangers. Unlike traditional AR heads-up displays (HUDs), AR glasses provide a larger field-of-view. While previous research has proposed various driving-assistance concepts using simulated displays, only a few have explored actual implementation or experimentation with real AR glasses. This study introduces a novel concept of visualizing risks through AR for driving assistance systems. We have designed and implemented three different interfaces specifically tailored for real AR glasses, integrating them into a driving simulator system. To evaluate the effectiveness of AR glasses in driving assistance, we plan to conduct experiments based on this platform in the future.",

After developing the anger induction materials, we conducted a driving simulator study with 30 participants and assigned them to low, medium, and high anger intensity groups. We found that drivers with low anger intensity were not able to recognize their emotions and exhibited speeding behaviors, while drivers with medium and high anger intensities might be aware of their anger along with its adverse effects and then adjusted their longitudinal control. However, angry drivers generally exhibited compromised lateral control indicated by steering and lane-keeping behaviors. Our findings shed light on the potentially different influences of anger intensities on young drivers’ behaviors, especially the importance of anger recognition for intervention solutions.",
