      "abstract": "As digital fabrication machines have become widespread and more accessible, practitioners in maker communities are particularly responsive to their development and technological upkeep. Drawing on interviews with five experienced makers that are engaged in modding of a laser cutter and insights from observations on maker-machine interactions at site, we studied makers ‘war stories’ to frame modding as a prevalent but less explored maker activity. We highlight how makers care for machines, how they cope with risks when engaging in modding, and how mods are creative projects in themselves. Based on our findings we present the conceptualisation of ‘the pliable machine’ – a socio-technical system that includes (1) an accessible machine that can be altered, (2) skills that go beyond use and (3) a surrounding ‘maker culture’ of caring, sharing and experimentation. Treating the machine as material in itself, we show how the laser cutter becomes pliable in the hands of those who mod - which offers an alternative perspective on relationships with technology.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Creative practice often requires persevering through moments of ambiguity, where the outcome of a process is unclear. Creative practitioners intentionally manage this process, for example by developing strategies to break out of creative ruts, or stay motivated through uncertainty. Understanding the way experts engage with and manage these creativity-relevant processes represents a rich source of foundational knowledge for designers of Creativity Support Tools. These strategies represent an opportunity for CST research: to create CSTs that embody emotional and process-focused strategies and techniques.  Through interviews with expert practitioners in diverse domains including performance, craft, engineering, and design, we identify four strategies for managing process: Strategic Forgetting, Mode Switching, Embodying Process, and Aestheticizing. Understanding tool- and domain-agnostic creative strategies used by experts to manage their own creative process can inform the design of future CSTs that amplify the benefits of successful strategies and scaffold new techniques.",

The domain of older adult-led maker-based communities offers HCI researchers the opportunity to explore not only how older adults innovatively and collaboratively create in later life, but also how we might design with these communities rather than for them. We report findings from a design workshop study spanning over two weeks involving 13 members of an urban Australian men’s shed. Our findings show that making in the men’s shed was influenced by (1) socio-materiality, (2) interpersonal dynamics and (3) shared expertise. We provide HCI researchers with an understanding of how older adults worked collaboratively within their own creative community as found through the deployment of a novel card-based probe, a workshop and followup investigations. We further unpack recommendations for organising design workshops with older adult maker communities that work towards meaningful community-oriented participation and greater agency in co-design studies.",

Through Co-gnito we investigate gaming as a means to elicit subjective spatial experiences and to steer the synchronous construction of a physicalization that aligns and represents them. Evaluating Co-gnito with 28 players, we found that storytelling as a gaming mechanic, motivated the gradual addition of personal contributions towards a collective outcome, but that the reward system did not nudge the mapping direction as expected. We also demonstrate how the shared construction process of a physicalization was influenced by the negotiation of the data encoding scheme, the token physical affordances, and the game mechanics. We therefore believe that our core contributions, comprising of: a working research prototype; an augmentation of the physicalization pipeline towards collaborative settings; and a set of reflective considerations, provide actionable knowledge on how to design participatory physicalizations in the future.",

Specifically, this work focuses on the effects of interactive technologies on research practices, referred as “interactive research artifacts.” Current research investigates the communicative affordances of such technologies, but there exists minimal work which critically examines the creative ways scholars are engaging with these artifacts. Through in-depth interviews with 14 scholars, and Design Studies literature, this work arrives at an understanding of interactive research artifacts as creative knowledge creation tools, rather than simply communicative tools. As such, to design for a future where interactive research artifacts become commonly used scholarly tools, an in-depth understanding of the ways these artifacts are used as knowledge creation tools is critical.",

      "abstract": "Collaborative creativity is an essential part of modern teamwork and is often supported by formal techniques, such as design thinking. Current support tools are often limited in scope as understanding the time-varying nature and structure of team communication is insufficient. We investigate how collaborative creative activities in new product development teams can be digitally supported while maintaining face-to-face communication. This work analyzes to what extent paralinguistic and proxemic features of team interaction relate to performance in new product development teams and if and how this relationship differs for different stages in the design process. This is investigated by applying multilevel modeling on data collected during a four-week new product development cycle. The cycle was completed by four teams, during which data were collected automatically using sociometric badges that capture social signals of team interactions. In addition, the data are combined with survey-based measurements on the team's daily design process and periodic performance evaluations. The current paper provides evidence that social signals are related to team performance and that this relationship varies across the stages in the product design process. Certain social signals contribute positively in one stage but less in other stages, showing the importance of using multimodal signals when modeling high-level collaborative patterns. This research contributes to the literature by providing a better understanding of relevant factors when designing supporting tools or methods for collaborative creative problem solving.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Remote scientific collaborations have been pivotal in generating scientific discoveries and breakthroughs that accelerate research in many fields. Emerging VR applications for remote work, which utilize commercially available head-mounted displays (HMDs), offer the promise to enhance collaboration, through spatial and embodied experiences. However, there is little evidence on how professionals in general, and scientists in particular, could use existing commercial VR applications to support their cognitive and creative collaborative processes while exploring real-world data as part of  day-to-day collaborative work. In this paper, we present findings from an empirical study with 14 coral reef scientists, examining how they chose to utilize available resources in existing virtual environments for their ongoing data-driven collaborative research.  We shed light on scientists' data organization practices, identify affordances unique to VR for supporting cognition in a collaborative setting, and highlight design requirements for supporting cognitive and creative collaboration processes in future tools.",

      "abstract": "Advances in text-to-image generative models have made it easier for people to create art by just prompting models with text. However, creating through text leaves users with limited control over the final composition or the way the subject is represented. A potential solution is to use image prompts alongside text prompts to condition the model. To better understand how and when image prompts can improve subject representation in generations, we conduct an annotation experiment to quantify their effect on generations of abstract, concrete plural, and concrete singular subjects. We find that initial images improved subject representation across all subject types, with the most noticeable improvement in concrete singular subjects. In an analysis of different types of initial images, we find that icons and photos produced high quality generations of different aesthetics. We conclude with design guidelines for how initial images can improve subject representation in AI art.",

Children aged 5-11 years played the video game, which involved assembling contraptions to escape a digital world, and the robot Jibo acted as a collaborative peer that offered questions, reflective prompts, challenges, and ideas. In order to evaluate the role of the robot's co-presence and creativity scaffolding, we ran a 2x2 experiment to determine the factorial efficacy of the robot's embodiment and creativity scaffolding behaviors. We observed mixed results, with the robot's creativity scaffolding having a positive influence on the time taken to complete the game, but not on the overall use of novel objects or reuse of objects. We present the system design, user study and findings from Escape!Bot to investigate the feasibility of designing social robots to support creative problem solving. ",

      "abstract": "Research ideas are pivotal in research practice. While research domains, topics, and methods are often outlined by specific research fields, the process of capturing and developing research ideas is less categorical. Conceiving and developing research ideas requires continuous creative thinking, usually supported by various different tools, each more or less carefully selected by a researcher to fulfill a specific purpose. In this paper, we investigate the creative work practices of academic researchers, with a focus on the workflows and tools they employ to manage ideas. Through a qualitative survey ($n$=51) and in-depth interviews ($n$=18) with researchers from a wide range of fields, we identify and describe typical processes of managing research ideas, different types of research ideas (\\textit{a research question or problem}, \\textit{a method}, \\textit{a hypothesis or antithesis}, and \\textit{a theory}), properties of good research ideas, as well as potentials for tools and technology to support idea management for researchers.\r\n",

We propose a framework of 10 creativity triggers for creative human centered AI opportunity detection, based on research and categorization of information retrieval tasks and cognitive task analysis. The method aims to facilitate a dialog between data scientists and underrepresented groups such as non-technical domain experts. Impact on problem discovery and idea generation was evaluated in co-creation workshops. Results show that the method significantly increases ideas’ scores on the appropriateness to a specific problem and their AI relevancy. Participants experienced the prompts as a helpful mental framework about AI methods and felt encouraged to decompose user stories into more detailed cognitive tasks that help data scientists relate ideas to high level data science methods.",

      "abstract": "Within the emerging field of e-textiles, goldwork embroidery (also known as metalwork) which uses metal threads and materials is an underexplored area, despite being a centuries-old practice in traditional crafts of different cultures. In this paper, we explore the material culture of textile goldwork to better understand how e-textile researchers can leverage their material properties, palette, and practices. First, we provide a historical background of English and European goldwork to give HCI researchers context on this craft field including technological and cultural influences. Then, we interview 13 contemporary goldwork practitioners on their creative practice to better understand the tools, techniques, and skills they employ. Our study findings show how goldwork practitioners deal with the unique constraints of metal threads and materials, and how these materials need to be handled differently than regular non-metal threads and fibers. Finally, we contribute guidelines and opportunities in the form of four concrete design recommendations for the field. Overall, this paper addresses a research gap on the potentials of goldwork and how we can leverage these practices for the future of e-textile hybrid crafts.",

We investigate curating an interactive online gallery in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the opportunities afforded and design constraints imposed by the Gather.Town platform and the experiences of the participating practitioners. We present auto-ethnographic reflections from Author 1, who created the online gallery space. We draw on the experience of Author 2 in curatorial research to analyze the experience of emerging practice through interviews with participating artists and curators. Results show that many of the artists were positively surprised by the platform engagement opportunities and conference attendees’ engagement with the artworks at the gallery opening, and appreciated the equitable, global reach. Further analysis reveals a desire for future iterations, and an exploration of the platform in a hybrid context, alongside an in-person exhibition.",

      "abstract": "Educators in professional higher education experience difficulties addressing students’ self-awareness in their courses. The topic is often dismissed by students as ‘vague’ or ‘irrelevant’. This is detrimental for learning since knowing who you are and who you want to be is crucial: it guides behaviour and helps to feel balanced and in control. Support is needed to trigger students’ self-awareness and to make this process less demanding. In this paper we present guidelines for interactive triggers supporting students in developing their self-awareness. We asked students to discuss self-made photos in small groups and offered them three paper prototypes of triggers to work with. Questionnaire results and analysis of students’ discussions resulted in insights on how these triggers provoke distinct interaction and support self-awareness. Insights in advantages and disadvantages of the triggers can be used to design and implement innovative interactive systems that engage students in the process of developing self-awareness.",

However, it is difficult to identify points of engagement unobtrusively; HCI studies typically use retrospective protocols or rely on cumbersome sensors for real-time analysis. We present a case study on how children compose digital music at home in which we remotely identify points of engagement from patterns of interaction with a musical interface. A mixed-methods approach is contributed in which video recordings of children's interactions whilst composing are labelled for engagement and linked to i) interaction logs from the interface to identify indicators of engagement in interaction, and ii) interview data gathered using a remote video-cued recall technique to understand the experiential qualities of engaging interactions directly from users. We conclude by speculating on how the suggested indicators of engagement might inform the design of adaptive music systems.",

When a loved one dies, it is inevitable that their body will decease as well, meaning that physical closeness can no longer be experienced. In this paper, we engage with material ways to extend experiences of physical and emotional nearness beyond death. We explore the design space of ‘bodily heirlooms’: crafted, precious, interactive objects designed to pass on bodily impressions beyond lifespan. We review cultural practices that intend to bequeath the body, and related work that addresses death, bereavement and digital heirlooms. After that, we describe the design and making process of three bodily heirlooms, reflections in and on action, and reactions of visitors who inspected the heirlooms during an exhibition. We conclude by discussing notions of heirlooms’ preciousness, the emotional bond between heirlooms and their maker and how the process can be understood as a feminist practice. ",

In a creative collaboration, communication is an essential component among collaborators. In many existing co-creative systems, users can communicate with the AI, usually using buttons or sliders. Typically, the AI in co-creative systems cannot communicate back to humans, limiting their potential to be perceived as partners rather than just a tool. This paper presents a study with 38 participants to explore the impact of two interaction designs, with and without AI-to-human communication, on user engagement, collaborative experience and user perception of a co-creative AI. The study involves user interaction with two prototypes of a co-creative system that contributes sketches as design inspirations during a design task. The results show improved collaborative experience and user engagement with the system incorporating AI-to-human communication. Users perceive co-creative AI as more reliable, personal, and intelligent when the AI communicates to users. The findings can be used to design effective co-creative systems, and the insights can be transferred to other fields involving human-AI interaction and collaboration.",

We selected two opportunities from the study and developed them as two modes, Artistic Mimicry and Zen Garden. We also conducted a workshop study using Sand Playground to evaluate collaboration and the characteristics of the tangible interface. We identified findings responding to drawing strategies, multisensorial experience, and performative and ephemeral quality of creation.  We discuss next steps of achieving our ultimate goal: an AI-mediated interface that collaborates with users physically in real-time on sand.",

The study explores how the use of the AI tool can be understood in terms of co-creation, focusing on the one hand on how the tool may serve as a resource for understanding and learning, and on the other hand how the tool affects the creative processes. Findings show how the participants search for a 'correct' syntax in their instructions to the machine learning tool, and how the inconsistent and erroneous behavior can work as a way to generate clues and inspiration for generating creative expressions. The notion of friction is used to describe how systems like this can serve to both lower thresholds for programming, and also interfere with the creative processes, encouraging reflection and exploration of alternative solutions.",

We designed our model through a collaboration with an expert Duncanian dancer, using five flexible ribbons joining at the solar plexus and animated it from motion capture data using a tailored optimization-based algorithm. We display our model in a Hololens headset and provide features that allow to visualize and manipulate them in order to understand and learn Duncan's choreographic style. Through a series of workshops, we explored our system with professional dancers and were able to observe how it provides them with an immersive experience of a novel visualization of Duncan movement qualities  in a way that was not possible with traditional human-like or skeleton-based representations.

      "abstract": "As previous studies have shown, the environment of creative people can have a significant impact on their creative process and thus on their creations. However, with the advent of digital tools such as virtual instruments and digital audio workstations, more and more creative work is digital and decoupled from the creator's environment. Virtual Reality technologies open up new possibilities here, as creative tools can seamlessly merge with any virtual environment the user finds himself in. This paper reports on the human-centered design process of a VR application that aims at supporting the user's individual needs to support their creativity while composing percussive beats in virtual environments. For this purpose, we derived factors that influence creativity from literature and conducted focus group interviews in order to learn how virtual environments and 3DUI can be designed for creativity support. In a subsequent laboratory study, we let users interact with a virtual step sequencer UI in virtual environments that were either customizable or fixed/unchangeable. By analyzing post-test ratings from music experts, self-report questionnaires, and user behavior data, we examined the effects of such customizable virtual environments on user creativity, user experience, flow, and subjective creativity support scales. While we did not observe a significant impact of this independent variable on user creativity, user experience or flow, we found that users had specific individual needs regarding their virtual surroundings and strongly preferred customizable virtual environments, even though the fixed virtual environment was designed to be creatively stimulating. We also observed consistently high flow and user experience ratings, which promote human-centered design of VR-based creativity support tools in a musical context.",

      "abstract": "While recent works have shown that it is possible to find disentangled directions in the latent space of image generation networks, finding directions in the latent space of sequential models for music generation remains a largely unexplored topic. In this work, we propose a method for discovering linear directions in the latent space of a music generating Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). We use PCA, a statistical method to transform the input data such that the variation along the new axes is maximized. We apply PCA on the latent space activations of our model and find largely disentangled directions that change the style and characteristics of the input music. Our experiments show that the found directions are often monotonic, global and encode fundamental musical characteristics such as colorfulness, speed and repetitiveness. Moreover, we propose a set of quantitative metrics to describe different musical styles and characteristics to evaluate our results. We show that the found directions decouple content and can be utilized for style transfer and conditional music generation tasks.",

However, the act of writing is a dynamic cognitive process in which evolving ideas are organized into a coherent narrative. This process is not shared with readers because they only see the final product. In this paper, we explore the benefits to readers of watching a real-time writing replay. We recorded the writing process of professional writers (n=13) and interviewed them about their and others’ replays. These writers found replays engaging. Replays facilitated self-reflection and helped writers empathize with each other. In addition, we conducted an online survey (n=78) to compare readers’ comprehension and perception of writing replay with that of traditional text. We found that writing replay enhanced user engagement and the perceived quality of the text for some writing styles. Participants from both studies considered using writing replay regularly.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Museums have increasingly focused on digital technologies and play as means to provide personalized, engaging experiences for their audience. Balancing educational and playful values is often conflicting. To address that conflict, museums often employ participatory design strategies. However, those strategies usually end after the deployment of those experiences, thus they do not accommodate for what occurs during actual use. In this article, we follow Light House, a research-through-design experiment of an installation that was developed using an iterative design approach which expands on actual use by deploying undetermined artefacts to support the discovery of novel interactions by visitors. Through our findings, we explore the “failure” of Light House to support the discovery of such interactions in relation to its educational character, but rather it inspired people to incorporate it in the activities supported by the surrounding space. Finally, we discuss the implications those discovered interactions in terms of potential re-design directions.\r\n\r\n",

      "abstract": "This workshop focuses on emerging approaches for using Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to support and augment personal creativity. Recent developments in generative Machine Learning demonstrate the ability of AI systems to perform tasks which are often associated with creativity - generating imagery, composing music, writing prose, etc. This workshop will examine opportunities for incorporating this kind of functionality into the creative practice of designers, artists and craftspeople, in practical and experimental ways. It will focus on how AI might enhance, rather than supplant, individual human creativity, through collaboration, serendipity, and creative reflection. We seek to engage a broad range of creative practitioners and researchers, bringing together those already using AI in their practice with those who are new to the technology, to understand emerging approaches and define future opportunities.",

Brainstorming workshops are powerful tools for developing design solutions or interventions, creating empathy, driving alignment, decision making and prioritization, and also for creating a deep understanding across a diverse group of creators. However, holding useful and energizing brainstorming workshops can be challenging given the variety of stakeholders and their ways of problem solving -- made even more so with remote or hybrid work teams. This “Workshop on Brainstorming Workshops” is designed to highlight and model effective tools and best practices for practitioners to drive their own useful design thinking based brainstorming workshops in a fully remote or hybrid environment. We expect to share real world brainstorming techniques, trainings and templates from embedded researchers at Meta, sharing our insights and best practices, as well as facilitating a space for sharing of all participants’ insights around these challenges. Additionally, we expect to create a space to learn together and improve practitioners’ techniques.",

In this workshop, participants will investigate ways in which MM tools can effectively support building STEM learning toolkits for novice learners from diverse backgrounds. Participants will engage in hands-on activities designing and simulating water-triggered morphing artifacts using a software tool called morphing beads and fabricating them with low-cost materials. The goal of this workshop is to collectively explore creative opportunities and barriers to introduce emerging STEM concepts and skills to novice learners. We hope to ideate frameworks for designing educational toolkits which leverage the accessible nature of morphing beads, democratizing a process which would typically require advanced material synthesis and specialized lab settings. Designers, educators, learning scientists and researchers are welcome to join us in brainstorming ways to develop toolkits to support creative exploration in education with MM.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this workshop is to rethink ‘making’ AI through a focus on the physical materials involved in designing, producing, and running artificially intelligent systems. The recent manufacturing chip shortage illuminates digital technologies’ physicality and the fragility of the commodity and production networks that underpin the AI systems our cities, governments, and workplaces have come to rely on. Those that are conventionally considered to ‘make’ AI through the design of AI systems are largely divorced from AI’s materiality and the craft of making AI. Corresponding research on AI and creativity focuses primarily on the digital artefacts, potentials and imaginaries AI creates, and less so on the social and material artefacts embedded in its ability to create. We hope to push participants beyond the theoretical knowing of AI materiality to tactile knowing through a practice-based approach to ‘making’ AI. Reorienting the focus of AI to materials and the supply chain as sites of creative intervention could leverage the potential of sensory, tactile experiences to spur re-imaginations of AI technologies and infrastructures. Ultimately, the aim is to advance creative approaches to the design of AI systems through the craft of making them.",

      "abstract": "Co-design methods and toolkits are commonly used to involve people from diverse backgrounds and disciplines in design processes, promoting collaboration, design thinking, shared decision making, and creativity. These methods and toolkits are generally tailored to in-person workshops supported by different physical artifacts (e.g. card-sets) in a shared physical location. Physical co-location and artifacts allow participants to interact in seamless ways, relying on everyday modalities of interaction. The CoViD-19 pandemic has forced many of such workshops online. This required transforming location, methods, toolkits and to rethink interaction among participants.\r\n\r\nWith this workshop, we aim to look back at these experiences of transformation and to reflect on the affordances of the physical and the virtual in co-design workshops. What are the challenges of transforming location, methods, and toolkits that are designed for in-person workshops into the digital? In which ways can in-person and virtual workshops co-exist and complement each other? \r\n\r\nWe invite participants to share their experiences and reflect on how to bring together virtual and in-person co-design workshops.\r\n",

      "abstract": "This one-day workshop invites designers, researchers and practitioners whose work might involve design, to collectively speculate about designed artefacts and technologies through the creation of drawing conversations: visual dialogues resulting from the merging of drawings created by different people. The workshop aims to use drawing as an activity for collaborative engagement with ambiguity, interpretation and mutual learning. Through drawing activities, we aim to join in Venice’s rich creative traditions, and develop speculative visualisations in order to find common grounds between the diverse research interests of our organisers and participants.",

      "abstract": "Hybrid Environments – spaces where physical and digital elements are blended in-situ – have been growing and expanding over the past few decades. As these technologies become woven into our everyday lives, new challenges and opportunities emerge as they transform our experiences in our homes, workplace, museums, and citiese. Designing hybrid environments requires training in both design of physical environments and interactive technologies. Cross-trained students in higher education need to be able to creatively respond and adapt to these emerging landscapes. Students must bridge fundamental knowledge in design, architecture, art, interactivity, and computation. This is a complex pedagogical practice. How are educators meeting this emergent need? The workshop’s primary goals are to (i) form a collective understanding of the current technology and pedagogical challenges to teaching the design and understanding of hybrid environments; (ii) bring together educators and practitioners interested in the future of hybrid environments, (iii) discuss creativity support tools as well as, frameworks, methods, and approaches for teaching emerging technologies, (iv) form a multidisciplinary community to shape the future of pedagogical inquiry and implementation to hybrid environments.",

It uses a commercial EEG headset to monitor the participant's beta and theta brainwaves. When the viewer is focused the displayed color field unifies into a single hue, and when distracted the field separates into multiple different hues with a mottled pattern. The movement of the color patterns is regulated by a three-dimensional flocking algorithm, and the system runs on a microprocessor. Using biofeedback adds interactive dynamics to the aesthetics of the artwork. This paper describes the techniques and processes used in the artwork’s design and places it in context with other brain art pieces. ",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, a vision-driven culture dominates the immersive design. Since the digital immersion mostly depends on the high-performance and expensive head-mounted device (HMD) to operate a complex 3D virtual world for stimulating the visual illusion, financial, technological, and accessibility barriers exist to consuming these devices. There is a significant amount of prevalent research on provoking participants' visual senses in an immersive experience. However, the audio aspect, often auxiliary to the visual illusions in immersive experience design, remains underexplored. This poster describes the creative process, design rationale, and preliminary findings of \\textit{Taoisonic Zone}, an interactive interface rooted in ancient \\textit{Taoism} and traditional Chinese five-elements musicality aesthetic. My design provides an affordable, minimalistic, and interactive web-based audio immersion experience, contributing to the small but exciting corpus of works aiming at emphasizing audio instead of visual experience in meditative immersion.",

      "abstract": "Stories of Herbs is a visual, auditory, tactile and olfactory VR experience around the theme of herbs. Our goal is to advance the understanding of how smell can be used actively in our interactions within VR. Specifically, we use physical objects – a mortar and pestle - with which participants actively create smell as part of their action in a corresponding world within VR. In the current experiment participants crush mint leaves, and corresponding virtual leaves guide their attention to an animated story about mint. We examined how enjoyment, recollection of the story, the experienced connection between physical and virtual, and the perceived role of smell were influenced by crushing real mint leaves or odorless paper ‘leaves’. Initial findings from an exploratory study with 15 participants show that the smell was a positive element in the experience, that participants in both the odor and odorless groups experienced a strong connection between the physical and digital elements, and that while some participants felt that smell helped them remember the story, the smell may have contributed to a sensory load that took attention away from the story.

      "abstract": "World-building is among the most relevant and challenging aspects of authoring an interactive digital narrative. These challenges can even be more significant when designing tangible interactive narratives. The author must define how and when to express the material aspects of the narrative in the real world and how artefacts can support this storytelling process. This poster introduces the creative process of world-building a tangible interactive narrative: The Non-myth of the Noble Red. In this tangible narrative, world-building is based on a Brechtian approach to explore ways in which closing the gap between performance and space can involve the user into a more active role while becoming conscious of the social implications presented in the narrative. Reaching out to principles and concepts brought from theatre and other forms of performative arts places the performative component and discourse of the narrative in the foreground of the experience. This approach can be used to identify considerations that are usually ignored in mainstream interactive experiences by prioritizing the narrative’s critical discourse and exploring more artistic and experimental approaches to storytelling.",

      "abstract": "Quantum Mechanics could have fundamental impact on design models and measurement. Quantum mechanics allows us to fill in the blanks of classical models of design, through its ability to explain ambiguous states of design. An ambiguous state is where design exists in between two binary states, as a superposition. Designers are most likely to be unfamiliar with quantum mechanics, as well as the subject of quantum mechanics being complex and sometimes contradictory to human scale mechanics. By discussing the opportunities of quantum mechanics for design, we are proposing a framework to model and measure ambiguous dimensions of design through quantum superpositions. The proposed framework includes the dimensions for the directionality of design (convergence or divergence), the degree of design embodiment (from low to high) and the decision-making of the designer (yes to no). Once the designer attempts the measurement of a superposition, a binary state can be distilled. For the act of designing, filling in the blanks is equal to sculpting away superposed states. In this philosophy, to design is to measure. This early stage research raises areas of opportunities and suggests further research directions for quantum mechanics and design.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we argue for the potential and relevance of hackathon participation for designing novel AI co-creative systems. There has recently been an increased interest into the potentials and challenges of creative collaborations between humans and AI, however, there have not been many practical implementations of co-creative systems. We argue that by designing co-creative systems to support the specific kind of creative design work in hackathons, valuable contributions can be made in the context of an overlooked aspect in interaction design; how to support fast design thinking. The specificity of hackathon participation involves high demands for fast idea generation, decision-making, and prototyping, which ideally ends in a functioning and novel prototype. Specifically, we identify three key characteristics of hackathon participation, and for each characteristic we discuss how they may model Human-AI interaction in the context of co-creative systems for fast design thinking.

      "abstract": "Morphing Matter (MM) is an emerging multidisciplinary field that combines material science and digital fabrication. It empowers people to engineer materials that respond to a specific energy or stimuli and transform its shape or other characteristics such as stiffness, opacity, and phase. This poster introduces creative pathways with MM to engage girls in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning, sparking interest in the field. We share our experience designing a set of learning tools that introduce novices to MM by fabricating morphing artifacts triggered by water. Further, we present a pilot MM workshop highlighting our reflections on designing learning experiences to foster high-school-aged girls' curiosity and interest in STEM.",

With our system, children can control the movements and actions of the characters and tell stories like puppeteers. The interaction is simple and intuitive for children to learn and use. The preliminary results of this field study suggest that the system can effectively stimulate children’s creative desire and imagination, encourage personal expression and exploration, and provide a way to communicate and cooperate with peers. Being low-cost, flexible, and robust, the system can be easily and quickly deployed in schools and other places while maintaining strong practicability and affordability that even extend into remote rural areas.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present our exploration of using and interpreting a generative tool, fiction collages, which integrates different perspectives in a materialized form and constructs narrative design ideas through a co-speculation process. We conducted a workshop with a research group of multidisciplinary experts who were ideating techno-social interventions for Yunlin, an aging county in Taiwan. The purpose of collaging is to provide a malleable but robust metaphor that stays open to interpretation. Four types of visual materials, e.g., app icons, everyday objects, scenes photos, and local publications, are served as content for narrative construction. The results illustrate how the generated collages facilitate situated co-speculation through both solo- and co-narration among experts. The juxtaposed collages and elicited stories as a whole construct the design fiction for near-future Yulin. To conclude, the study contributes to the community with a narrative way of using collages for co-speculation that aims for mutual informing.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Virtual communication has turned into a necessity in current culture. Although major technological breakthroughs were made in the past decade, virtual communication platforms do not prioritize the emotional connection between people. Shmoodle is an online platform in which two participants communicate orally while doodling with each other virtually on a shared canvas. Designed to favor emotional exchange over efficiency and clarity, Shmoodle integrates the users’ facial expressions into the conversations via control over the brush color and responds to synchronous facial expressions via the canvas background color. Initial testing with three pairs of users revealed that drawing and exploring the effects of the platform together gave them a heightened sense of connection and a playful disposition.",

A paper-cutting artwork was created controlling a knife to cut the designed paper. Paper-cutting draft designs have two parts: a white and black areas for cutting-out and painting, respectively. The difficulty level of the picture was measured based on the thickness of the cutting borderlines. Thus, in this study, a retouching system that reduces the difficulty of draft design by ad- justing the line thickness was developed. Further, the effects of this system on a novice production was experimentally investigated. Consequently, the system was confirmed to improve accuracy and psychological state (flow state) via retouching the draft design.",

      "abstract": "Many researchers focus on the relationship between culture and creativity, often analyzing the influence of culture on design creativity. However, most studies only draw conclusions about the positive or negative effects of culture on creativity, rather than providing solutions to mitigate the adverse impact or magnify the positive impact. Therefore, in the current study, we first developed a dedicated framework to explain the influence of culture on design creativity based on the 4Ps model of creativity (person, process, product, and press). Then, we analyzed the influence of culture on design creativity based on Hofstede’s dimensions of culture. Following this, we identified the methods and solutions that can be adopted to mitigate negative cultural influences and prime positive cultural influences on design creativity. Finally, we proposed possible solutions to mitigate the negative cultural influences and prime the positive cultural influences by applying innovative technology to design creativity. Our study will inspire researchers to mitigate the negative influences of culture, magnify the positive effects, and apply new technology to enhance creativity. ",

      "abstract": "Participatory research led us to identify that students lacked means to represent their individual journeys through study and that their diverse goals, challenges and personal contexts were not easily understood. Prompted by this, we created ‘Our Journey’ to support them and harness the value of these narratives as a means for reflection and communication. This paper explores self-narrative processes and how they can be beneficial, describes the design of Our Journey, and introduces examples of collaboratively-developed pilots, where different activities using the platform are being devised and trialled. We reflect here on how new opportunities for self-narrative creativity can be supported in simple and engaging ways, and how flexibility in the design means the same underlying structure can be used online and in a physical form, for one-off retrospective narratives and ongoing journal activities, and with prompts for individual and shared reflection as appropriate.

      "abstract": "Interactions between children and their caregivers represent an important factor of child development. Book sharing and other play interactions are common ways in which caregivers and their preschool-age children interact. Shared book reading has many benefits in early childhood, but some researchers have suggested that children may become passive in such interactions. Additionally, with caregivers having sole access to the information in the text, they may be less open to contributions the child puts forth if they conflict with the text. In contrast, a more symmetrical and cooperative activity, such as putting together a puzzle, may elicit more participation from the child and less categorical input from the caregiver. In a study with 59 2- and 3-year-olds and their caregivers engaging in one of these two activities, we find that interactions centered around the puzzle artifact are characterized by more meaningful participation on the part of the child and less definitive corrections on the part of the caregiver compared to book-based interactions. These findings suggest that alternatives to shared book reading with 2- and 3-year-olds may nudge children to express themselves more creatively when interacting with caregivers. Implications for the design of learning experiences for preschoolers are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Non-profit approaches in the sharing economy are proliferating in everyday life (e.g., tool libraries, food sharing collectives). They focus on promoting social, economic, and ecological sustainability within local communities. However, prior research uncovered emergent challenges of these communities that prevent their endurance and growth. Despite growing academic interest in studying these communities, designers found it difficult to effectively adopt newly generated knowledge in practice. Addressing the research-practice gap, we developed a translational resource for design practitioners to conceptualize new value-added features for supporting technologies in the sharing economy context. Specifically, we synthesized emergent challenges in non-profit sharing economy communities and key social and environmental sustainability efforts in design research into a familiar format for designers – the card-based toolkit to support generative design activities. Beyond introducing the toolkit, we offer a “how-to” guide for its adoption in collaborative settings. ",

For art students, practitioners, and hobbyists, these institutions are often visited to provide inspiration and practice, although, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact. National lockdowns and restrictions, and social distancing measures meant museums and art galleries underwent mandated temporary closures and socially distanced specified visitor routes often meaning onsite art practice was no longer permitted. This exploratory pictorial takes a first-person research method to present a collection of reflections, experiences, and example artworks by facilitators of an art practice group, that moved from on-site to online practice during the pandemic.",

We consider how this creative collaboration is affected by the hybrid inclusion of more-than-human participants in the form of watercolour and artificial intelligence. Our drawing experiments were an extension of our search for new ways of seeing and telling, which includes a reflection of the extent to which more-than-human elements took part in our creative process. We discuss our tendencies to form strange interpretations and assign meaning to the unpredictable and ambiguous spaces we created with them. We further speculate on the characteristic material agencies they revealed in our interactions with them. Finally, we contend how such collaborations are already and always embedded and embodied in our ways of seeing and knowing in design and creativity research.",

      "abstract": "I was not born a designer – sometime this identity shift must have happened. I was unaware of it, and if asked, I would still not know how to define a “designer”. Drawing and sketching are activities intrinsic to the design discipline, and are widely understood as tools for communication, documentation, or artefact-driven reasoning. But are they also essential to the understanding of design knowledge? Or a symptom of a designer’s identity rather than a tool for “designerly ways of knowing”? During a week-long design workshop I dealt with difficulties making sense of a panoply of embodied design methods in the absence of a sketchbook. In this pictorial I describe my self-diagnosis as a sketch-bound designer, unable to digest abstract knowledge without holding a pen. I advocate for sketching as focusing, and a primary activity in design epistemology that needs no other than a first-person reason to be performed.",

In the 21st century this relationship takes a new turn, with the introduction of new technological means, especially in computational neuroscience and machine vision, that aim at recording, quantifying, analyzing, reproducing and automating the gaze. This pictorial essay is a multilayered investigation applying new modes of technological objectification to creative representations of eery, uncanny images of blindness and displaced eyeballs, in the history of art and cinema. It highlights the problematic nature of this form of objectification, and calls into question the means, assumptions and conclusions that are brought about in the process of objectifying the gaze, by pointing out the culturally saturated substrate already embedded in the act of viewing.",

      "abstract": "In this pictorial, we present Kolam, a visual artform originating in Tamilnadu, South India, as an ecofeminist computational art practice. We provide a visual documentation of Kolam’s Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) through eight characteristics based on existing research and authors’ personal experiences as Kolam practitioners. We begin by framing Kolam as an ecofeminist practice, highlighting cultural and ecological characteristics of Kolam as a Tamil tradition. We then illustrate evolving hybrid multimedia and contemporary technological practices that characterize Kolam as computational art. Our aim is to present a cohesive and compelling visual narrative using the artwork of authors and four contemporary Kolam practitioners to inspire creativity and highlight challenges for relational knowledge production in design and Human-Computer nteraction (HCI) research.",

      "abstract": "Craft and motion are strongly connected, and reflection about this connection enhances our understanding of digital creative experiences. We summarize seven key steps for reflection in craft and create machine-assisted motion-centric tools to support reflection for each key step. These tools reveal different properties of the recorded movement sequence and the relationship between movement and created models. We tested the tools with a sample of novice users who were asked to create a wire-based jewelry model with a set of creation intentions. The resultant qualitative data and visual analysis charts show that introducing the motion information helps the user to meaningfully reflect on their creative experiences and ultimately enhance their decision-making in terms of selecting the models and creating subsequent digital craft-making movements. We therefore hope that our study will stimulate future discussion to bring motion-centric reflection to digital craft processes.",

Documentation of handicrafts is challenging and needs creativity because individual craftwork heavily depends on the understanding of the materials at hand and the hand movement to apply the creator’s unique kinesthetic knowledge. In this study, we investigate the layers of information for crocheting intelligence visualization. To frame the structure of the learning process, we conduct introspective ethnographic research and visual analysis. From the insights from the crocheter’s sketches, we develop idea sketches and prototypes of overlay designs for instructional videos and augmented reality. Discussion follows on design implications for visual learning of kinesthetic cognition over augmented reality and visual medium.\r\n",

Inspired by traditional textile arts and cultures, we applied an artistic approach into technological textile design and merged new materials, sensing technologies, and digital fabrication with contemporary dance and music into one united and harmonious piece of object and performance. In this pictorial, we present and discuss our textile design rationale, fabrication strategies, hardware systems, musical mappings, as well as our collaborative effort with a professional dancer to demonstrate the interactive electronic textile carpet. Our work challenges the conventional relationship between choreography and music and unveils dancer and/or sound artist’s creative possibilities of agency, intimacy, and improvisation over the choreomusical performance through a novel textile interface.",

      "abstract": "Creating sound by manipulating the location of sound-producing objects using gestures is an interesting interaction paradigm. To understand it better, we analyzed videos of users interacting with ‘Random Access Lattice’. In this sound installation, users move a loudspeaker to explore sound laid out in space using a time to space mapping. We performed an inductive analysis of user movement in relation to the visitor intention and the sonic outcome. We identified several body, hand, and grip gestures which were performed with different movement qualities to manipulate the loudspeaker at variable speeds, orientations, and body areas. These were used to search and trace the sonic material in a goal-oriented fashion but also to interact creatively with sound by looping and modulating sounds. We provide a visual index of our findings which can be used when designing gesture interactions with sound.\r\n",

      "abstract": "One can argue that we now have Artificial Intelligence (AI) capable of making better drawings than humans. Outcomes generated by neural networks can be creative and, if not that, at least impressive for their realistic rendering. Some of these computational drawing applications build upon human input, be it text, an input image, or even a hand-drawn path using the cursor. However, drawing along a present-day computer yields a very different experience from drawing collaboratively with another person. For one, the shared canvas is likely not a physical sheet of paper but rather a screen of some sort. Even with paper-like computer interfaces, the computer mainly draws back virtually, needing no material embodiment to make a drawing. \r\nMy research investigates human collaboration with computers that draw, specifically focused on the act of sketching. I build exploratory physical systems that allow people to draw and sketch together with a computer. Through my studies, I investigate 1) the process of human sketching, 2) the meaning of collaborative sketching with computers, and 3) appropriate interaction design to allow for human-computer collaborative sketching. My initial studies with a first experimental platform show that the computers are social actors (CASA) paradigm also applies to non-anthropomorphic pen plotters when performing a Tic-Tac-Toe playing task.",

      "abstract": "For much of its history, AI was a scientific discipline defined more by its portrayal in science fiction than by its actual technical achievements. Real AI systems are now catching up to their fictional counterparts, and are as likely to be seen in news headlines as on the big screen. Yet as AI matches or even outperforms people on tasks that were once considered yardsticks of human intelligence, one area of human experience still remains largely unchallenged by technology: our sense of humour. This is not for want of trying, as I will show. The true nature of humour has intrigued scholars for millennia, but AI researchers can now go one step further than philosophers, linguists and psychologists once could: by building computer systems with a sense of humour, capable of appreciating the jokes of human users or even of generating jokes of their own, we can turn academic theories into practical realities that amuse, explain, provoke and delight. This talk will challenge the archetype of the rigidly humourless machine in popular culture, to make a case for the necessity of a truly computational understanding of humour. By giving our machines the ability to understand and generate humour -- including sarcasm and irony -- we can better understand ourselves as we construct machines that are more flexible, more understanding, and more willing to laugh at their own limitations.

In this paper, I discuss the current challenges of data physicalization and address three areas of research where data physicalization can aid in other research thrusts: broadening participation, supporting analytics, and promoting creative expression. This paper exemplifies each approach through the lens of my work.",

      "abstract": "Creativity is an important driver of innovation and corporate success. Due to the digital transformation, creative collaboration increasingly occurs in virtual teams. This raises the research question how to design digital work environments to foster creative virtual collaboration. Therefore, this PhD project aims to develop design knowledge for virtual collaboration based on the Design Science Research (DSR) approach. The identification of Creativity Drivers (CDs) anchors the descriptive knowledge in a rigorous theoretical foundation. Prescriptive knowledge about design requirements will be derived from expert interviews with creative professionals. To combine both, prescriptive and descriptive knowledge, Design Principles (DPs) will be developed that address creativity drivers in five areas: functionality, process, mood, meaning, and collaboration. The appropriateness of the DPs will be validated by interviews with experts. The results will be used to review the CDs and refine the DPs. Further, the DPs will be used to define an instantiation of a virtual working environment for creative groups, which will be evaluated in an experimental setting. The results contribute to the scientific literature by combining and expanding relevant theories. The practical contribution lies in the applicability of design knowledge in different business-related and educational contexts.",

      "abstract": "Pelican Stairs is a multimedia art project started during the depths of Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. The project’s reflections on how one’s umwelt (one’s unique experience of living in one’s environment) changes in response to an all-encompassing crisis can serve as a guide, or a provocation, about how future cities need to be reimagined to encompass flexible life-pattern options for their denizens not only to survive but to thrive through the challenges before us. I took photos of my local neighbourhood, Wapping in London, on my daily walks between March and September. I often visited the Thames shore area by climbing a set of steps known as Pelican Stairs. Using those photos as a training set, I generated new images with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which I paired with excerpts from my diary during the same period. The unsettling, almost-real images contrasted with the mundane reality of the diary entries allow the viewer to viscerally (re)experience the inherent tension between an increasingly uncertain external reality and internal attempts at control or sense-making through normal, everyday habits. The project is hosted at https://pelicanstairs.art, and the project includes an interactive element through a Twitter bot which responds to a specific prompt by sharing a random image of generated art from the project.

      "abstract": "“zones of flow (iii)” is a photo-sensitive installation that investigates the fluid and changing connections between people, sea and land. It addresses the instantaneous but sometimes asynchronous connectivity between things as they move, are placed or displaced in their environments. The artwork brings origami structures, electronics and audiovisual media together to create an immersive cogitative environment. A video projection depicting water surfaces is mapped onto a 2.5m paper-boat. Underneath, arrays of light sensors receive waves of information and send signals to small paper-boats scattered across the floor. The flotilla of small paper-boats is activated and becomes a changing water surface where non-linear patterns emerge over time.",

      "abstract": "Coffee cup reading is a popular social activity in some cultures and seen as a playful way of speculating on a person’s past, present and future life. If we think of coffee cup reading as a way to envision futures, can we use this practice as a method for creating speculative design fictions? This paper proposes a workshop in which 10 people living in Venice will enact future inhabitants of the city and read each other’s coffee cup in pairs to create speculative design fictions that envision Venice in 2030. The workshop will result in a catalogue of design fictions comprising text and drawings produced by each pair that will present different future visions for Venice. After the exhibition, this catalogue will be exhibited in a dedicated online space to present the design fictions and photos and/or videos created during the workshop as well as visitors' feedback. The workshop aims to provide insights about how coffee cup reading as a traditional way of looking into possible futures could be used as a low-threshold design activity to reveal urban inhabitants’ visions and concerns towards uncertain futures as well as today’s challenges.",

      "abstract": "The global pandemic has changed how we interact. Microsocial behavior in public and private space has been transformed under the banner of social distancing. Fears of being close to others have wide ramifications, from social isolation to lack of cultural exchange and diversity in public spaces. These changes in microsocial behaviours have ramifications on larger scales, and recent research even connects the pandemic to a loss of democracy around the world.\r\n\r\nThis artwork invites participants to imagine how we will relate to the other in a post-pandemic future, to reflect upon how norms for social togetherness are changing, and to reconsider social interaction as a crucial aspect of coexistence in urban settings.\r\n\r\nOur sense of place, belonging, and identity is shaped by soundscapes. Sound can be considered an architectural material: flexible and open to infinite transformations, sounds construct and deconstruct public and private spaces \\cite{Born2013, Avidar2008}. The global acoustic environment has been greatly expanded in the last years, offering unprecedented opportunities to the “ethnographic ear”. By working with geolocated field recordings of Venetian soundscapes and remediating these soundscapes according to the movement  of sonified objects in the installation space, this artwork co-constructs a sonic narrative of coexistence in particular, urban settings.

      "abstract": "What do news landscapes look and sound like? And how can we transform them into tangible objects to see clusters of over-reporting, or to hear the missing voices in under-reported topics? A new artwork called Fragile Perspectives was developed to explore how news coverage clusters for different themes. Using a very large news information set generated to explore creative angles and voices in news, new tangible objects of news landscapes were produced by clustering 10000s of individual news articles into 300 dimensions, then reducing these dimensions to 3-dimensional maps. These 3-dimensional maps were then manufactured as glass objects produced using the glassblowing techniques similar to those perfected on the Venetian island of Murano, then digitally scanned to excite virtual strings to produce the sound using a data sonification method based on physical modelling sound synthesis. These glass objects and the generated sound were combined to produce the Fragile Perspectives artwork.",

This demo presents three morphing matter toolsets that enable novice learners to design shape-changing food, artistic figurines that transform underwater and inflatable wearables. We aim to thoroughly demonstrate each step in the design process for morphing arts and crafts projects triggered by various stimuli such as heat, moisture, and air pressure.

      "abstract": "Iterative City is an animated interactive projection developed from a series of 3D rendered urban structures and systems (transit hubs, water treatment facilities, oil refineries, government buildings, schools, hospitals, etc.) which exist within a video game engine. Each structure is animated by a motion sensor, to detect the movement of viewers entering into and navigating the presentation space. Each structure in the projection will move along a predetermined path, based on the amount that the viewers are moving around the physical gallery space. As they do, the cityscape that is presented to them will fluctuate, adjust, and reform constantly, never standing still.\r\n\r\nProjected onto one or several walls of the room, Iterative City will present a window into a hypothetical city, constantly repositioning in relation to its viewers/occupants. An infrared motion sensor will be mounted in a plinth along the wall opposite to the projection, gathering data on viewers moving into and through the space. In order to drive home the user-initiated motion present in the projection, the structures depicted will also each have their own audio component, whose volume will increase as the structure is driven into motion and telegraphing to the audience that their presence activates the work.",

      "abstract": "Pollution in real time can be incredibly powerful, but is difficult to communicate. Persistent deterioration of land, air, and water are largely invisible to the eye and camera lens. What if water itself could visualize its quality and perform the level of contamination? Ripple Effect is an environmental art installation that reveals water contamination through sonic vibrations and light. Using software technology, water contamination levels are translated into sound waves. The installation consists of speakers that play ‘data sound tracks’, which vibrate water held in attached trays. Participants see and hear the water vibrate based on contaminant concentrations. This paper describes the concept, data-to-sound process, implementation, and participant evaluation surrounding the installation of Ripple Effect in communities neighboring resource extraction and other industrial activity. While there are many existing artworks that visualize environmental quality, Ripple Effect is novel in its use of local water quality data and interactive technology that allows the primary medium, water, to communicate directly with the participant.",

      "abstract": "POSTcard Landscapes from Lanzarote I and II are two AI-generated video works accompanied by two sound pieces. The StyleGAN 2-created visuals were composed of location-based datasets, more precisely, from Flickr photos of Lanzarote – a tourists’ Mecca of Canary Islands. One video intends to represent a touristic, and the other, a local view of the place. The project draws attention to the influence of the tourist gaze on the landscape and identity formation of the Lanzarote island in Spain. Heavily dominated by the imaginative geographies that have been constantly reproduced by the visitors, create a conflict between desired touristic rituals, which one is preprogrammed to reproduce when arrived at the destination, and the reality. Better said in the words of an expert on tourist photography Jonas Larsen “[. . . ] circulating images overpower reality: ‘reality’ becomes touristic, an item for visual consumption.” [3]",

      "abstract": "Water Mirror is an aesthetic experiment in perception and interactive art. It is a new development from a series of prior works concerned with light, wind data and place. Comprising synthetic and video imagery viewed through two-way mirrored glass, Water Mirror focuses on effecting a distended perception for the viewer to occupy the in-between space of the physically present self, various virtual selves, and a virtual representation of the city. The experience is one of leaning into an organic unfolding, with the self becoming visible from different angles and times, while ‘submerged’ in virtual waters of Venice. This draws on the shimmer of light that sparkles on water surfaces as wind disturbs them. Here, this visual language informs a data visualization of weather conditions in the lagoon outside. It is an organic, fluid interaction that moves the viewer into hybrid spaces, where the self is mirrored back to you within an abstract rendering.",

In this, we are particularly interested in non-verbal communication and expression as a design material for interaction design. In this demonstration, we present a prototype illustrating this opportunity: a tinyML-enabled helper that augments the Google Home and enables it to recognize and respond to everyday phenomenon such as a sneeze, a door opening, or rapping on a table. The helper offers a creative toolkit for designers and end-users to quickly explore, understand, and imagine the affordances of everyday sounds.",

      "abstract": "The pandemic’s sudden closure of galleries and museums and the following online art race filling our home screens has revealed that new ways are needed to make and display art, to reach and interact with new audiences, and to think of spaces for the dissemination and enjoyment of the arts .These concerns became particularly relevant for the Emergent collective since its primary goal is to bring different voices together in a sustained dialogue. The unfolding of the pandemic highlighted the need to treat the gallery as an emergent space itself rather than just a venue.\r\nThe result was, for our team, a complete rethinking of what the gallery space means and represents: in a disrupted world where the need for safety limits the need for physical interaction, the following probing questions emerge:  How can we imagine alternative formats, new forms of interactions, new safer and more inclusive spaces? Can we take the gallery to the streets and turn it into an emergent space? What are the possible experiences it would generate? What new dialogues can a redesign of the gallery as a living, breathing entity foster?\r\nWith this project, we propose to move the gallery outside of its traditional space and redesign it as a multimedia and multipurpose mobile gallery. The result is not just an attempt to find a new solution to problems related to health safety. In fact, we consider this an opportunity to transcend the clean and protected space of the gallery and to establish new human and non-human connections “on-the-go” with different urban spaces and the people who inhabit them.\r\n",

It’s left up to the audience to determine if the creature design is intended to reflect an inert or alive hybrid - is it a mecho-organic splice? A robotic turbine critter perhaps? Or maybe it’s instead a strange mythological, or dream-like, monument. Its name derives from a combination of the words “recycle” and “cyclical”, and one theoretical purpose it has is wind energy capture, while illustrating how recycled materials can be repurposed to create aesthetically pleasing objects that embody a reuse ethos. At present, this virtual artwork is only a prototype of a potential physical rendering.",

The short film challenges colonialism, consumerism, and capitalism through visual representations of real dream accounts and land stewardship stories. Initially designed to offer comical solutions to the global COVID pandemic via radical program proposals for international air travel, “Essential Voyage” has expanded in its conceptual format to capture the internal and spiritual journey of “becoming indigenous” to a place, in hopes of encouraging others to do the same. From surreal scenes of antiquated stoves and the beginnings of food competition, to being denied travel for lack of an Earth protection agenda approved by indigenous governing bodies, “Essential Voyage” visualizes some of the ways that human and non-human beings are communicating with some of us to defend our home planet now, more than ever.

The work co-imagines interspecies relationships through the gelatinous lens and imagined temporalities of snails through trails, sculptures and positional audio that appear in real time uniquely for each visitor. The Virtual installation is housed in the application Lure of Slowness, available for download on Apple and Android store.The work is in dialogue with multi species theory emerging in the humanities and eco feminist discourse. The application and artwork is designed to Reflect on slowness and movement journeys of adaptation past, present, futures. We believe that Lure of Slowness, Hydrological Rhythms will contribute to the conference theme of creativity, cognition, and place from a multispecies perspective. \r\n \r\nEschewing the predictable, ever-increasing speed of technology the work provides a way to fuse the virtual or the imaginary with the physical environment. Rhizomatic in nature, guiding questions in the project are “What can be gleaned from organisms that have navigated with embodied intelligence through time responding intimately to the rhythms of water, in our time seemingly becoming increasingly wetter and warmer due to anthropocentric climate change? How can technology be used to sense the world differently? What would it mean to move differently, practicing interspecies choreographies present and emerging futures? \r\n \r\nThrough the experiential artwork reflections on these questions can be experienced by the audience engaging within the multichannel virtual experience and sound journey. We imagine them walking around the narrow streets of Venice exploring and co-imagining worlds through the application.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Digital-Tropical: Venice of the East highlights the significance of traditional cultural wisdom in the contemporary context of global warming. Although the Malaysian climate is different to Venice, like Venice, traditionally, houses in Malaysia are designed to function around water, and in the rise and fall of river levels due to the monsoon and tides. Traditional Malay houses are made with wood using modular design that can be reused for generations. Although the houses are built high on stilts, there are doors which do not have stairs that are only used during flooding to access boats. In this artwork, a LiDAR video of a 300-year-old traditional Malay house, will be juxtaposed with visualization of historical ocean wave height data using light projection. The data were collected near Tioman Island for two years for a renewable energy project. Traditional Malay houses ‘work around’ the natural environment to function in the uncertainties of nature, unlike many technologies which arose from scientific advancement that ‘subdue’ the natural world by making irreversible and detrimental changes to it. Renewable energy technology also needs to function in the uncertainties of nature by ‘working around’ it. We need the knowledge of wave patterns to generate electricity. Thus, this artwork juxtaposes the tropical architecture of old, with a new technology paradigm, both that ‘work around’ nature, to preserve nature. Malaysia came under Western colonization with the fall of the entrepôt city of Malacca in 1511. The title of this artwork is inspired by Vasco de Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who once described Malacca as “Venice of the East.” With this, we would like to highlight that even though Malaysia and Venice are separated by climate, cultural and geographical distance, we are living together in a warming world which will affect Malaysian cities as much as it will affect Venice.

Iceberg homes are mansions owned by London’s super rich where the sub-ground levels are larger than the house above ground. The home in question was not developed due to hundreds of objections from surrounding neighbours in Knightsbridge, West London, England.\r\n\r\nConstruction Lines shows this iceberg home rendered as a 3D model, using the original architectural plans and the software ‘Sketchup’. The script of the film, the model of the home, and the scenes played out within it, are directly informed by written objections the surrounding neighbours filed against the planning application, as well as online articles speculating about the lives and lifestyles of the super-rich. \r\n\r\nThe film responds to the increasingly atomized aspects of urban existence; the speculative potential of computer-generated architectural visualizations; and the hysteria that can ensue when overly protectionist neighbourhoods of ‘stakeholders’ take local planning disputes into their own hands.\r\n\r\n",

      "abstract": "In Millenia as Moment: A Triptych in 75 Colorgrams, Comp-syn showcases state-of-the-art computational methods for depicting how a city like Venice, as a collective entity, perceives itself overtime. Millenia as Moment consists of colorgrams, a unit of visualization invented by Comp-syn1 . Colorgrams are produced by aggregating hundreds of images using a mathematical representation of colorspace that is optimized to emulate human perception. In Millenia as Moment, each colorgram aggregates the top 100 images associated with a word in Google search results, such that the Triptych consists of 75 colorgrams (words) in total. Via the PageRank algorithm, Google's search results are adapted to large-scale patterns of search activity bound to a geographical IP address, which allows our method to identify cultural associations that emerge as a result of the decentralized information seeking activities of entire populations, akin to the dynamics of a city. First, we present a Triptych of 75 colorgrams imaging the past, present, and future of Venice using English search terms implemented from New York City. We then replicate this Triptych while composing each colorgram using the Italian translation of each word, searched from an IP in Venice. A goal of Millenia as Moment is to imagine how cities perceive, think, and experience as collective cognitive agents. For this reason, Millenia as Moment resists linear reading. Color and shape present cognitive trails on which the viewer's mind is led, but not always to a logical destination. The words provide a map, though not always a reliable one, just as the maps of a city evolve through the Odysseus ship of its political inhabitants. An experience of meaning lies in the ineffable space between the words, images, and their arrangement, much like the identity of the city hangs ineffably between its people and its innumerable structures, spatial, temporal, and conceptual.",

      "abstract": "What could the Venice of the future look like?\r\nA project for an ideal city can take off from an allegory: arts and sciences inside a seed of {\\em Lodoicea maldivica}, whose bipartition reminds us of a human brain. From the seeds left by the past, we derive the vision of the future.\r\nThe ideal city certainly needs brains able to conceptualize images and develop ideas, and bridges to strengthen connections and interactions. A well-working brain needs ``bridges'' as connections between ideas and techniques. My vision for a future city contains a livable and stimulating space enhancing at one time creativity, enthusiasm, and scientific development. To this aim, I use the image and the metaphor of cerebral hemispheres, specialized in activities of different typologies yet interconnected.\r\nThe image of the brain is one of the symbols of cognition. The right hemisphere deals with artistic expression, while the left hemisphere refers to logic thinking, mathematics, scientific attitude toward the world.\r\nDifferent cerebral areas, which contribute to the complex and rich life of an individual, are a metaphor for different places in a city, contributing to the completeness of a community life.\r\nSeparation between hemispheres, also as a homage to Venice, is seen as a sort of Canal Grande, and connections are represented by bridges. The whole brain is seen as a giant seed of {\\em Lodoicea maldivica}: the city of the future needs to develop from seeds, that is, knowledge inherited from the past and new ideas from our minds and thoughts. Thoughts that, in turn, are fed upon the Science of Complexity.",

      "abstract": "A growing body of work in InfoVis explores its user experience (UX), however, emotions remain underexplored. Our study reveals barriers for investigating personal connection and emotional reaction to visualisations. This provides an explanation for why the role of emotions so far received little attention in InfoVis. Twenty-four participants viewed two traditional data visualisations, answered UX questionnaires for each, and were interviewed about their experience. Our findings show that traditional visualisations are seen as ‘just a graph’, that represents neutral information. Participants referred to aesthetics, legibility, and usability, instead of the actual topic. Moreover, to make sense of the data, emotions have to be separated from it. We found four possible explanations underlying this belief and argue that a form of post-hoc rationalisation takes place, which obscures people’s initial connections and affective responses to visualisations. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for future research on the UX of visualisations.",

In this review, we gave an overview of recent studies that supported children's creative learning using TUIs. Results showed that TUIs had many advantages, such as they (1) were novice-friendly, (2) supported children's cognitive process and development, (3) promoted their initiatives, (4) enabled them to think outside the box, and (5) encouraged communication and collaboration in an authentic context. Meanwhile, we summarized previous work's three main limitations: First, most of the studies did not have a long-term experimental verification with sufficient sample size and objective evaluation; Second, some TUI designs lacked a balance of abstractness, openness, richness, and complexity; Finally, the use of TUIs had little consideration of the teacher's role. Therefore, further research should focus more on the trans-disciplinary nature of TUIs for creative learning and leverage collaboration between human-computer interaction researchers and school teachers.",

      "abstract": "Cybersecurity related concepts can be difficult to explain or summarise. The complexity associated with these concepts is compounded by the impact of rapid technological changes and the contextual nature of the meaning ascribed to the various themes. Since visual imagery is often employed in articulation and explanation, we conducted a study in which we asked participants to sketch their understanding of cybersecurity concepts, such as trust, risk, and privacy. Based on an analysis of these sketches and subsequent discussions with participants, we make the case for the use of sketching and visuals as a tool for cybersecurity research. Further, our collection of sketches and icons can serve as the seed for a visual vocabulary for cybersecurity that can help people develop clearer conceptual understanding.",

      "abstract": "Fabricating objects from a player's gameplay, for example, collectibles of valuable game items, or custom game controllers shaped from game objects, expands ways to engage with digital games. Researchers currently create such integrated fabrication games from scratch, which is time-consuming and misses the potential of integrating fabrication with the myriad existing games. Integrating fabrication with the real-time gameplay of existing games, however, is challenging without access to the source files.\r\n\r\nTo address this challenge, we present a framework that uses on-screen visual content to integrate fabrication with existing digital games. To implement this framework, we built the FabO toolkit, in which (1) designers use the FabO designer interface to choose the gameplay moments for fabrication and tag the associated on-screen visual cues; (2) players then use the FabO player interface which monitors their gameplay, identifies these cues and auto-generates the fabrication files for the game objects. Results from our two user studies show that FabO supported in integrating fabrication with diverse games while augmenting players' experience. We discuss insights from our studies on choosing suitable on-screen visual content and gameplay moments for seamless integration of fabrication. ",

This paper investigates how collaborative, creative, and embodied interactions can foster AI learning and interest development. We designed three prototypes of collaborative, creative, and/or embodied learning experiences that aim to communicate AI literacy competencies. We present the design of these prototypes as well as the results from a user study that we conducted with 14 family groups (38 participants). Our data analysis explores how collaboration, creativity, and embodiment contributed to AI learning and interest development across the three prototypes. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) three designs of AI literacy learning activities and 2) insights into the role creativity, collaboration, and embodiment play in AI learning experiences. \r\n",

Preliminary results show that sound-driven design is inherently embodied, situated, and participatory, that the four categories of interviewees equally contribute to the definition of the design problem, and yet that a clear, shared arena is still missing.",

Interviews with eight creative writers highlighted two key practices: Over Criticizing, where perfectionism and negative self-appraisal demotivates them and reduces their output; and Creative Voicing, where speaking their text aloud promotes reflection and inspires new possibilities. A structured observation study compared writers’ perception of their own, pre-recorded text versus computer-generated voices. The latter distances them from their text and offers new perspectives. We developed SonAmi, an interactive coaster that voices selected dialog whenever the author lifts their mug. Two creative writers said SonAmi made them feel they were listening to “someone else’s text” or “a podcast”, which helped them identify and improve writing issues. We show how tangible creativity support tools can build upon authors’ existing strategies i.e., voicing their own words, and take advantage of naturally occurring events e.g., taking a sip of coffee, to support productive procrastination without interfering with creative flow.",

The use of watercolour, a medium that bleeds and  has leaky boundaries, allowed ambiguity, defamiliarization and critical reflection to enter the research space, encouraging new understandings of artefacts and their latent possibilities. Watercolour was also valuable for speculating about designs that deal with bodily fluids, and for Drawing Conversations that facilitated reinterpretations of artefacts through drawings created by two different people.\r\n\r\nIntersecting themes about cognition, creativity and technology, this pictorial presents examples that illustrate how watercolour drawing can impact on the representation of speculative concepts, including the creation of visual conversations. The drawings shown here are presented as representations embodying families of ideas and themes related to the objects they symbolize, together with the design spaces they suggest and the stories they invite us to imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It comes in 2 acts: an already exhibited one \"Gradient Descent Into the Wetlands\", and work in progress. The project deals with the idea of reconstructing the natural skin of critical zones by algorithms and neural networks. The term critical zones was introduced by Peter Weibel and Bruno Latour \\cite{WeibelLatour}. It is the area of the Earth's surface, thin but vital skin of the planet, which is now influenced by the human impact. Biodiversity in this kind of zones is in danger.",

It provides an aesthetics-based evaluation of a case study, Bodyharp, a new digital musical instrument at the intersection of music and dance. My dissertation examines not only developing new musical instruments but also performance practices that can be shared across diverse skill sets and abilities. In this project, I investigate this approach by bringing both the musician's and the mover's experiences closer to each other. In this paper, the design of the instrument and its earlier iterations are provided as well as an ongoing user study. The preliminary results of the user study, the future directions of this dissertation project, and its anticipated contributions are discussed.",

      "abstract": "In this doctoral research program, the influence of algorithms on creative perception and construction is investigated. First, I outline the need for a clear framework that aims to measure viewer-defined online creativity. To meet this need, I offer a 5-part mixed methodology that synthesizes qualitative, quantitative, and visual data to construct a conception of online visual creativity. Then, I discuss applications of this framework to measure the impact of emerging technologies on human creativity. In a second study, I demonstrate the influence of TikTok’s algorithm on the content being filmed by its users; in particular, I investigate the Duet feature as a site of remixing rather than creatively collaborating. In sum, algorithms are shown to influence creative consumers by both curating the content that one is exposed to and by guiding the content that is initially created. Next steps for my dissertation work are also discussed.  ",

New exhibition formats including digital projections of fine art allow us to rethink how we can use technology to create art experiences.

In this project, I explore new ways of creating technologically enabled experiences with fine art paintings based on John Dewey’s concepts of aesthetic experience and expression. Utilizing a constructive design research approach, I create concrete prototypes and designs that expand research on aesthetics of interaction to propose new ways for museums to create art experiences.

The research adopts a trans-disciplinary approach, looking for opportunities to decompartmentalize knowledge and formalize efficient guidelines that facilitate adoption and operation of such technologies. Its main objective is to uncover the hidden assumptions embedded in these tools and formalize a theoretical framework able to describe the different concept ontologies employed during human-machine collaboration and their inter-operability. Three studies will be conducted to validate the framework, each addressing a specific domain (music, language, visual).",

In this paper, we present a pilot study of crea.blender SDG - an online GAN based image generation game. We designed crea.blender SDG with two goals in mind: The first, to let people create images relating to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and through them, engage in large-scale conversations on complex socioscientific problems. The second, as a fun and inspiring gateway for public participation in research, generating data for the creativity and cognition research and design community. Specifically in this pilot, we study and affirm that the design of crea.blender SDG is flexible enough to allow users to create images that express both anxiety and hope for the future; affirm that user generated images express these ideas in ways that are meaningful to people other than the original creator; and begin to investigate which specific features of images are more closely related to dystopian or utopian ideas of the future. Finally, we discuss implications for future design and research with ML-based creativity tools. ",

      "abstract": "Persistently, data has been part of our lives through the ages. Our use of data is nearly always private, often small, but has continually formed a part of how we live our everyday lives. Very often it is stored, saved, and preserved as part of our arts and crafts through the ages. It is important that we do not let the current ‘big data’ revolution with all its emphasis on bigness and power, alienate us from our deep connection with data. It is important that we share the potentially empowering aspects of the use of small, situated, and embedded data. I will discuss this in relation to my continued research towards promoting data comprehension by creating appropriate interactive technologies that can help people negotiate the everyday transformation of data into understanding. Specifically, I will talk about my research into extending the available visual representations, using interaction to expand the potential of existing visualizations, and into broadening the potential of information visualization by investigating engagement with new audiences. Just as data has in the past, it still has the potential to enrich our daily lives. Let’s not get dis-inherited! ",
