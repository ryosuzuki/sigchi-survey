      "abstract": "In design, we often deal with complex problems that require participatory, embodied sense-making to solve. We have multitudes of design tools – both physical and digital – to support these activities. While digital tools have continued to gain presence in the design processes over the last decades, due to, e.g., widened availability, improved flexibility, and the potential to increase productivity physical tools and analogue practices still hold a solid place in the early design process for many designers. To bridge the gap between the physical and digital, and to benefit from the best of both worlds in tools for design, hybrid tools are being developed. By exploring the characteristics of designing for participatory, embodied sensemaking, in the context of physical and digital tools, this paper aims to identify design opportunities for future hybrid design tools.",

Various designs exist to scaffold ‘embodied social sensemaking’, yet details of such scaffolding need elaboration. We investigate how artifacts scaffold embodied social sensemaking, strengthening links between theory and design. Twenty-four pairs of design-students created embodied augmentations to remote videoconferencing. Next to being young designers they were also active videoconferencing users in a COVID-19 lockdown. Outcomes provide a design space supporting remote embodied social sensemaking. Reflecting on designs we discern six social phenomena and three dominant design response frames. We show how different interpretations of theory produce different kinds of designs. We discuss ways of navigating the design space, the dominance of ‘tangible representation’, and provide pointers to design for ‘embodied couplings’. We close with a view of how different frames can be integrated into the overall theory of embodied social sensemaking.",

However, the accuracy of these tangible devices has not been studied systematically. We compared six input techniques, including slider, slider with resistance, capacitive touch slider, squeeze, rotary knob, and joystick, to understand their accuracy and resolution profile. Each of these wireless devices was designed in a similar form factor and intended to be operated discretely with one hand. We assessed input accuracy and participant perceptions across devices through a controlled lab study (N=20), highlighting diverging limits to the accuracy of the input technique and possible explanations for the differences in resolution. Our results indicate that participant accuracy was highest using a slider, and lowest using a squeeze-based input. We discuss the suitability and challenges of discreet tangible self-report techniques, and highlight open research questions for future work.",

      "abstract": "The \"material turn\" in HCI has placed a renewed focus on informing design from the relationships found in material-based interactions. While several ethnographic works provide insight into how practitioners converse with materials, it is less understood how these conversations transform into a skilled practitioner relationship with a material. We examine the material practice of glazing that gives ceramics its decorative and functional characteristics and involves fusing mixtures of silica, alumina, and flux onto a clay body through kiln firing. This practice evolves over decades developing from multiple trajectories including theoretical foundations, systematic experimentation, and happy accidents. This work describes virtual site visits with six expert ceramicists and documents how material knowledge is externalized in practice, teaching, and the studio environment as boundary objects. We synthesize our findings into a framework to inform the design of material interactions that moves beyond discrete and momentary material encounters towards lifelong material epochs.",

While many fabrication techniques are available for prototyping physical or electronic components, creating mirrors requires manual computation and industrial manufacturing equipment and is therefore considerably slower and more expensive.\r\nWe propose a technique for fabricating mirror surfaces based on thermoplastics sheets with a laminated metallization layer and 3D-printed fixtures for bending or vacuum forming.\r\nGiven our toolchain, a simulation of mirrors for cameras and projectors by rendering the CAD model is possible and allows to fabricate and evaluate design iterations quickly, making the process reasonably accessible for research.\r\nFinally, we show two prototypes for tangible interfaces based on our mirrors for projection and camera-based interaction, discussing advantages and limitations.",

      "abstract": "Research in HCI is increasingly investigating the role of technology in supporting meaningful and social activities to enhance the lived experiences of people with dementia. However, to further enrich the daily experiences in care, more insight is needed into how technology can promote social participation and pleasurable experiences directly in everyday care situations. This paper discusses the deployment of VITA and SAM: two research products that address the social and emotional needs of residents in day-to-day dementia care. We report how both products offered aesthetic and sensory enrichment, created new experiences in the everyday, and were integrated into the care environment. Furthermore, we identify implications for design to provide: 1) aesthetics in care, 2) authentic experiences, 3) reinforcing of everyday life, and 4) community-driven use in practice. We contribute to existing research by demonstrating how technology for dementia care can transcend instrumental use and culminate in warm-felt everyday experiences.",

We present Push-Ups, a pair of pneumatic shoes capable of outputting motions to users’ feet soles via the shape-forming shoe bases, to enhance users’ kinesthetic experience in a virtual ski. Each Push-Ups shoe comprises four pneumatic muscles in the base, allowing to present ten shape patterns and thus ten different motion outputs. Our first study validated the effectiveness of the motion output through a recognition study. The second study evaluated the user experience of the system on a virtual ski experience, which showed that users perceived higher enjoyment and realism with the kinesthetic force feedback provided by Push-Ups.\r\n",

This study aimed to fill the gap and reviewed 92 publications from all the TEI conference proceedings (2007--2021). We analysed previous studies' characteristics (e.g., study purpose and interactive modalities) and elaborated on three common topics: collaborative tangible learning, tangibles' impacts on learning, and comparisons between tangibles and other interfaces. Three key findings were: (1) Tangibles had impacts on learning, because it could scaffold learning, change learning behaviour, and improve learning emotion; (2) We should see the effectiveness of tangibles with rational and critical minds. Finally, some studies emphasised too much on the interaction of tangibles and ignored their metaphor meanings. For future work, we suggest avoiding an intensive cluster on collaboration and children, and see other valuable areas, e.g., tangibles for teachers, tangibles' social and emotional impacts on students, tangible interaction's meaning and metaphor.",

We present a research-through-design exploration of a novel SCF material that can be developed in restaurant kitchens using everyday kitchen appliances with the only addition of a commercial desktop 3D food printer. Our lightweight process involves the preparation of edible paper, which can be folded into origami shapes and is actuated through the addition of an acidic liquid. We facilitated participatory sessions with five chefs in their restaurants and evaluated our material. Our qualitative study contributes design guidelines on how to incorporate SCFs into chefs’ everyday culinary practices. Building on the chefs’ perspectives of our material and its culinary potential we conclude with a speculation of how SCF materials could enable novel multi-sensory and interactive food experiences.",

      "abstract": "Personal fabrication empowers users to create objects increasingly easier and faster. This continuous decrease in effort evokes a speculative scenario of Ephemeral Fabrication (EF), enabled and amplified by emerging paradigms of mobile, wearable, or even body-integrated fabrication. EF yields fast, temporary, in-situ solutions for everyday problems (e.g., creating a protective skin, affixing a phone). Users solely create those, since the required effort is negligible. \r\nWe present and critically reflect on the EF scenario, by exploring current trends in research and building a body-worn fabrication device. EF is a plausible extrapolation of current developments, entailing both positive (e.g., accessibility) and negative implications (e.g., unsustainability). Using speculative design methodology to question the trajectory of personal fabrication, we argue that to avert the aftermath of such futures, topics like sustainability can not remain an afterthought, but rather be situated in interactions themselves: through embedded constraints, conscious material choice, and constructive embedding of ephemerality.",

To make ALGANYL, we optimized existing bioplastics for flexibility and strength, resulting in a biomaterial that acts and feels similar to vinyl fabric. Moreover, ALGANYL is a zero-waste material: can be fully recycled and fully degrades when composted. We further explored designing with ALGANYL by embedding color, texture, and sensing pigments. We showcase a wide range of applications made entirely of ALGANYL including a sculpture, doll clothing, environment-sensing accessories, and a recycled concert bag. We conducted a user study with 12 participants that made ALGANYL at home, fabricated their own applications, and then speculated on future applications for ALGANYL. Overall, participants found ALGANYL to be an accessible biomaterial that can be used for many applications. We hope designers and HCI researchers will embrace ALGANYL as a sustainable biomaterial for making recyclable and biodegradable artifacts.",

      "abstract": "A growing body of work focuses on physicalisations based on personal, everyday data. Despite growing interest, little is known about how to educate people on their creation. We designed a teaching method of 'Data Diaries', which consists of five representation assignments that move from visualising to physicalising personal data. The Data Diaries were used in a semester project, with the aim of creating an interactive physicalisation. We analysed the Data Diaries, written reports, and participant interviews. Our analysis shows that people need to overcome the challenge of using materiality to communicate data, which happens in four stages. Moreover, the materiality made participants realise that physicalisations do not focus on efficiency and accuracy, but on the story of the data, by referring to its origin, use of personal mappings, and reduction. As physicalisations blur the line between quantitative and qualitative, designing them engenders a change in our notion of 'data'.",

Existing solutions to add tangible user interfaces to smart devices often require complicated assembly or occlude part of the touchscreen. We propose ClipWidgets: 3D-Printed Modular Tangible UI extensions for smartphones. ClipWidgets uses a conical mirror and a custom phone case to redirect the rear camera of a smartphone to its periphery. This allows the phone to optically sense input of passive 3D printed widgets that are attached to the phone case. We developed three different widget types (button, dial and slider) that require no calibration and minimal assembly. To demonstrate the functionality of ClipWidgets we used it to prototype three different applications: A game controller, a music interface and an interactive graph tool.",

      "abstract": "Human perception lacks the capabilities to accurately assess distance. The recent Covid-19 pandemic outbreak rendered this ability particularly important. Augmenting our sense of distance can help maintain safe separation from others when required. To explore how systems can help users maintain physical distance, we designed, implemented and evaluated Gapeau---a head-mounted system for augmenting the sense of distance. Our system uses proximity sensors and thermal vision to detect and measure the distance to other people. We conducted a validation protocol, an experiment, in which we compared different feedback modalities, and an in-the-wild study to evaluate Gapeau's performance and suitability for use in social contexts. We found that our system enabled users to more accurately determine whether they were maintaining a safe distance from others. Vibration and auditory feedback were found most effective and usable. Gapeau was perceived as socially acceptable. Our work contributes insights for augmented sensing systems with social relevance.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Collaborative Mixed Reality Environments (CMREs) enable designing Performative Mixed Reality Experiences (PMREs) to engage participants’ physical bodies, mixed reality environments, and technologies utilized. However, rarely is the physical body purposefully incorporated throughout such design processes, leaving designers seated behind their desks relying on their previous know-how and assumptions. In contrast, embodied design techniques from HCI and performing arts afford direct corporeal feedback to verify and adapt experiential aesthetics within the design process. The practice-based project discussed in this paper studies the implementation of an adapted Social VR platform NEOS VR as a CMRE using specific embodied design techniques in a PMRE design process by comparing two case studies in higher art education. It proposes a Performative prototyping method, which combines Bodystorming methods with Wizard of Oz techniques, ”inside-out” somaesthetic and “outside-in” dramaturgical perspectives, and suggests an interdisciplinary vocabulary to share and evaluate PMRE experiences during and after its design collaboration.",

Although research into the use of video conferencing platforms for storytelling and games is limited, we suggest that there is much to learn from a design space that includes interpretations of popular game formats like escape rooms, role-playing games, and board games. Drawing on examples from online and offline contexts, we focus on the tangible and embodied characteristics of these forms of play to identify narrative design opportunities for video conferencing platforms. We contribute the documentation of our research through design process, resulting in three preliminary design guidelines to help facilitate tangible and embodied remote storytelling. ",

MyoSpring averts from a traditional `one-size-fits-all' approach and facilitates the development of functionally customisable wrist-worn sensors to recognise subtle finger gestures with a high accuracy. We automate the design process of MyoSpring sensors with an intuitive Graphical User Interface enabling novices to quickly design and fabricate customised sensors. We conducted a user study with 15 participants, and 12 gestures including partial and full flexion finger gestures to verify the functionality of MyoSpring. Through the evaluation, we show that 1) MyoSpring can achieve high average accuracy of finger gesture sensing of 94.11% (SD = 9.73%), 2) mechanical customisation allows MyoSpring to significantly improve the average accuracy of overall gesture sensing and 3) MyoSpring better supports partial finger flexion gesture sensing, achieving an accuracy of 91.44% (SD = 11.76%) for partial gestures alone.",

Participants were able to successfully use TactJam to learn about tacton design. We present an overview of mappings between tactons and their associated concepts before comparing the results of tactons created using solely a GUI and tactons created through experimenting with placements directly on the body. Conducting both parts of the workshop separately highlighted the importance of designing directly with bodies: less implicit assumptions were made, and designs were guided by personal experience. We reflect on these results and close on deliberations for the future development of TactJam.",

      "abstract": "The digitization of homes is progressing slowly compared to e.g., work environments. Smart Home focusses on automatization while there is relatively little discussion on strengthening interpersonal relationships as a potential benefit. The social nodes of our households remain largely unaffected by digital support to this day. Since the central table traditionally is the social interface of a home and we witness an ongoing stream of apps for digital connectedness it seems worthwhile to research interactive tables potentials of digital support. This paper describes the first steps with which we have approached the design of an alternative to the current notion of interactive tables. By a review of HCIs interactive table concepts and a subsequent survey about pleasurable moments at the table we develop design principles offering orientation for researchers and designers who want to amplify the acceptance and the deployment of interactive tables in homes by their future designs.",

      "abstract": "Gaming accessibility research for the blind or low vision (BLV) community largely focuses on adapting and designing digital games. There is a need for designers to understand BLV’s experience with tangible games that involve the player’s physical manipulation of game elements. In this study, we investigate BLV individuals’ gaming experience with tangible games, namely board and card games. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 BLV participants and found four themes that uncovered the participants’ tangible gaming experiences: (1) properties of inaccessible games, (2) outcomes of inaccessible games, (3) properties of accessible games, and (4) outcomes of accessible games. Our findings demonstrate a richness and variety in BLV individuals’ tangible gaming experiences. By providing discussions on the state of tangible game interactivity and design recommendations, our work assists the creation of accessible tangible games by affording designers the opportunity to understand how inaccessible interactions in tangible games work for BLV populations.",

      "abstract": "We propose CircWood, a method and workflow for producing various sensors and electrical circuits by partially carbonizing the wood surface with a laser cutting machine. Similar to wiring on a conventional printed circuit board (PCB), the carbonized part functions as a conductive electrical path. We use a defocused vector-scanning CW laser beam and reduce the time and cost required for fabrication than the conventional method of creating graphene by raster-scanning femtosecond laser. Our method uses an affordable CW laser cutter to fabricate a circuit, including touch sensors, damage sensors, and load sensors on wood boards. The circuit can be easily connected to traditional PCBs using metal screws and nails typically used in DIY woodworking. We develop a software design tool that supports the creation and fabrication of carbon paths. We report on a series of investigations, including optimizing wood materials and laser parameters to establish design guidelines.",

While this supports the creation of meaningful relationships, findings are limited on how it could support sustaining the significance of historical places. We selected two historical places of daily use and developed two AR apps for each. The apps aimed at fostering participants' indexing and meaningful connection to the places by presenting their history. One app offered passive, informative content. The other displayed an interactive, moral dilemma emphasizing the places' social values. We tested the apps in two between-subjects studies with N=42 participants in total. We explored how participants ' historical understanding can be improved by embedding our interfaces on five levels (spatially, physically, contextually, historically, and morally).\r\nWe found that the morally embedded AR stories supported active indexing stronger than the passive ones and argued that they could foster meaningful relationships between users and historical places.",

This work presents a large-scale interactive prototyping design toolkit called Strawctures. Strawctures is an electronic construction kit that consists of five types of electronic components (touch and light for input, vibration, buzzer, and LEDs for output) and connectors to enable form exploration and interactive construction simultaneously. By creating a simple and reconfigurable kit, we attempt to make an interactive prototype module that can be used for novice designers and those not confident in circuit building. With an increase of available modules, Strawctures aims to bring electronics to early stages in the design process, and from the hands of experts to those of artists, makers, and designers. As illustrations, we present applications of Strawctures with small to large dimensions such as a scarecrow, a pendant lighting, and a toy house.",

We envision a 2.5D painting device that aims at closing the gap between painterly expression and digital fabrication, incorporating expressive elements present in traditional painting with structural capability. The paper describes the development of the new pigment material and a custom handheld extrusion device, and discusses a user study investigating the emerging relationships with the developed medium. We find the reactivity and variability of the medium enabling strong expressive agency and new interaction opportunities. With these, we discuss what are aspects in making that could be embraced to enhance users' creative agency and ownership in making, postulating a space between artistic expression and utilitarian making--e.g. digital fabrication.",

Collecting first-person data can provide nuanced understanding of the lived experience of emotional life, to better inform the design of wearable technologies for emotional self-regulation. We present a preliminary study of our first-person phenomenological approach to autobiographical design. The methodology is unique for the intertwining of emotional activities and mindfulness exercises, as a strategy for controlling emotional repercussions. Self-observation and documentation included journaling and sketching using the Inside-Out Probe workbook, followed by material prototyping and testing in-the-wild. The Breathing Scarf prototype embodies the design considerations. In designing for one to support personalized self-regulation strategies, key considerations include designing for personal comfort, ownership, and individual-over-social meaning-making. Of equal importance in the design research process are the well-being of the designer/researcher, the ability to self-regulate emotions, and the ethics of care and emotion work.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, storytelling has attracted attention as a possible important application context for CAs. However, it is difficult to follow and recall the story flow by distinguishing their lines since most story content features multiple characters. We introduce Poly, a physically actuatable CA that implements a 2.5D shape display to help identify multiple characters in a story. To evaluate the effect of adding a novel approach of physical actuation into the conventional color expression technique, we conducted a 2×2 within-subject user study with two levels of shape change (shifting shapes by characters or not) and two levels of color change (shifting colors by characters or not) in a studio setting. The quantitative and qualitative analysis results show that shape change has a significant and exclusive effect on both user acceptance of Poly and narrative engagement of the story, although there is no interaction effect according to color change and shape change.",

      "abstract": "Our research aims at understanding if robots could be good at public speaking, what they need to achieve the level of a good public speaker and how they may surpass a human public speaker. Previous research results indicate that designing a robot speaker by mimicking some of the behaviours of a human speaker is not enough to create an effective robot speech performance. It can in fact be counter productive to strive for human-likeliness. In this paper, we describe how we programmed a toy-like, non-anthropomorphic small robot (the Anki Vector robot) to deliver a speech by extracting pose and facial expression information from the video of a human speaker and loosely retargeting this information to the robot. We also describe our experimental plans to compare Vector's speech delivery performance with the performance of a more anthropomorphic robot (the SoftBank Pepper robot), which has been programmed to closely mimic the human speaker's behaviour. They are compared in terms of their ability to evoke the positive affective responses necessary to spark interest, motivate the audience to listen, and engage the audience in meaningful ways.",

Each participant played a round of Tic-Tac-Toe against the robot, while we observed. We particularly focused our observations during the game on the participants’ physical and social behaviors during game interaction, as well as in-moment reactions from the participants. Following each game, we performed semi-structured qualitative interviews to understand the user’s experience interacting with the robot. Our questions were designed to elicit comparisons of their experience with less tangible interactions that players might have with a computer or phone-based app, as well as more traditional interactions that players might have with other people. We found that participants directly addressed the robot by talking to it during play and openly expressed competitiveness against the robot. Furthermore, participants displayed careful movements around the robot and attentively observed its behaviors. Based on these initial insights from our exploratory study, we are planning future experiments to investigate the effect that the mutuality of the physical Tic-Tac-Toe interaction has on social responses to the robot to understand what this implies for embodied and tangible interaction design.",

      "abstract": " Social robots have been used in mental health care interventions not only to increase access to mental health treatments, but also to complement the support provided by practitioners. We propose incorporating social robots in conventional treatments for children and adolescents with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). Although non-robotic, evidence-based interventions for social anxiety are already available, factors such as embarrassment, and anticipatory anxiety have led to treatment delay and avoidance among this clinical population. To encourage treatment and to further improve treatment outcomes, in this work-in-progress article we propose the incorporation of social robots in conventional treatments for SAD. Social robots offer many advantages, such as adaptability, being non-judgmental, and providing interaction capabilities, which could make them a useful tool in the hands of practitioners working with children and adolescents with SAD. We discuss the different roles that social robots could play in helping children with social anxiety make the most of conventional treatments. We also present preliminary results (68 participants) on adolescents' preferences for using intelligent agents in promoting mental well-being. We conclude by summarizing the potential benefits and limitations of using social robots in conventional treatments for social anxiety.",

As householders embedded the two designs in their sustainable practices, different design qualities emerged.

We explore the creative space of this approach, i.e., integrating functions such as sensing, display, and sound amplification into objects, for leveraging the paper-woven structure.

      "abstract": "Air traffic control (ATC) is a safety-critical work domain that has a history of applying tangible elements in its workstations. In the past, development was mostly technology-driven, which resulted in usability challenges like handling multiple input and output devices. In this work, we followed a user-centred design approach with air traffic controllers (ATCOs). Starting from the users’ need for haptic feedback, we developed a novel tangible interaction concept for ATC. We iterated a set of tangibles – Fin, Whale, Coin, and Flatterer – based on formative evaluations with 24 ATCOs. From our qualitative results we extracted dimensions relevant to ATCOs‘ user experience including familiarity, efficiency and engagement. Our results can provide guidance and inspiration for the design of future ATC interfaces.",

      "abstract": "This research aims to support positive wellbeing by encouraging people to take regular microbreaks from continuous on-screen work. We present Zenscape, an innovative tangible system that offers subtle reminders to engage in non-work related creative micro activities, through the stirring water action and sound. Zenscape integrates the ideologies of the Zen garden philosophy in its design and features a mini Zen garden consisting of sand and stones, and a water cup with a stirrer, all offering multiple micro activities for the user to get an escape from their work. Unlike time management apps, we do not target productivity, but rather focus on making the most of the microbreaks. We present a descriptive account of how we brought Zenscape into being through a conceptual framing of Diversion, Destination, Play and Return. We hope that our design reflections will inspire future systems on microbreaks beyond reminder and notification systems.",

      "abstract": "Although Augmented Reality (AR) has become increasingly common, the design of AR interfaces has predominantly relied on importing traditional 2D digital GUI interface elements. These do not always translate successfully to novel, three-dimensional, AR interfaces. To understand how users develop a folk understanding of AR interfaces, we conducted six workshops with participants to investigate their initial interactions with off-the-shelf puzzle interfaces, across three modes: tangible, handheld tablet, and head-mounted display (HMD) AR systems. We captured multiple points-of-view video data and co-analyzed it with participants. Our study (1) presents a catalogue of interactional gestures across the three modes; (2) highlights how errors are perceived as features in AR systems; (3) analyzes the evolution of gestures; and (4) identifies implications of occlusion and spatial judgement errors.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Body maps are visual documents, where somatic experiences can be drawn onto a graphical representation of an outline of the human body. They hold the ability to capture complex and non-explicit emotions and somatic felt sensations, elaborating narratives that cannot be simply spoken. We present an illustrative example of “how-to” complete a body map, together with four case studies that provide examples of using body maps in design research. We identify five uses of body maps as generative tools for soma-based design, ranging from sampling bodily experience, heightening bodily self-awareness, understanding changing bodily experience over time, identifying patterns of bodily experience, and transferring somatic experiential qualities into physical designs. The different requirements for scaffolding the use of body maps in user-centred design versus first-person autobiographical design research are discussed. We provide this Pictorial as a resource for designers and researchers who wish to integrate body maps into their practice.",

      "abstract": "Impaired hand function impacts many stroke patients’ daily lives, leading to a lack of independence and difficulty in performing activities of daily living (ADL). There are various assistive devices and interactive exercise monitoring systems that aim to help stroke patients perform unsupervised at-home hand rehabilitation exercises. However, for these efforts to work, the patients are required to self-supervise their rehabilitation process at home and allocate time in their daily schedule, which often is challenging. In this paper, we propose an alternative method. We hypothesize and test the idea of seamlessly integrating hand rehabilitation exercises with the products used for cooking. To this aim, we followed a research through design approach, developed Gr!pp and tested it with two stroke patients. Our results show that Gr!pp can facilitate intuitive use by its form. We also found other application areas of Gr!pp (e.g., eating) and improvement points (e.g., gamification) to promote motivation. We conclude our paper with further implications and our contribution to the tangible interaction design field.",

      "abstract": "Long-distance relationships (LDRs) have long been of interest in HCI research, and several strategies and designs for mediating intimacy have been proposed. This work-in-progress aims to explore and identify existing practices in experiencing intimacy in\r\ntechnology-mediated LDRs, to design artefacts that could mediate some of the related struggles, and to explore the prototypes with users. Based on the insights from seven in-depth semi-structured interviews and a creative task, we developed the concept of Qude,\r\nwhich entails two prototypes: a vibro-tactile wearable that enables a person to tap and send a rhythm to their partner; and a supporting app, through which users can assign meanings to the rhythms, thus creating an exclusive, tactile code. The paper concludes by\r\nreflecting on preliminary findings from four user explorations and the contextual analysis. We provide considerations for further iterations of Qude, as well as a discussion of possibilities for future designs.",

Air-pressure inside a shape-changing textile actuator is dynamically modulated, to create a perceivable pinch-like impression at the user’s fingertip. This dynamic pneumotactile pinch can be leveraged as a tangible output modality for interaction design. The soft actuators are driven by a pneumatic control system that adjusts the pneumatic pressure in response to the finger position. We have explored different textile air-chamber layouts to achieve tactile feedback and provide a preliminary discussion of their tactile capabilities and design patterns. We further give a brief overview of three different pneumatic control system architectures and their underlying tactile pressure profiles used to operate the actuators to create different types of tactile sensations. A preliminary discussion of the capabilities, challenges, and limitations of our system is also provided.",

      "abstract": "The global COVID-19 pandemic left few facets of our lives unchanged, including the possibility to play organised sports. Many gyms and sports clubs had to shut down due to social distancing measures, which resulted in reduced physical activity. Co-located group sports that promote social interaction and fun became almost impossible. This lack of physical interaction combined with social isolation and confinement have shown negative impacts on physical and mental well-being of people (for example, lack of motivation, anxiety, low immunity, low academic performance, negative mood and feelings) especially in children and young adults. Recent research therefore recommends exploring more creative approaches that allow physical activities during a pandemic, especially the ones that increase social interaction and engagement and allow users to share the same physical space. Towards this, we developed SixFeet, a novel digital-physical sports platform that allows its participants to play rigorous, collaborative sports -- at a six feet distance. SixFeet ensures that the players are 1.5m away from each other at all times without them noticing it or without them having to worry about the social distancing measures. We developed a prototypical implementation of SixFeet and conducted a pilot study to evaluate its technical feasibility and practicality as well as obtain a first insight into user experience with the platform. Results show that participants never came within 1.5 meters of one another, felt connected nevertheless and were physically exerted. This paper presents the design and architecture of SixFeet, results of the preliminary user study, and a discussion on the versatility of SixFeet in accommodating training for different sports in times of a pandemic.",

      "abstract": "Digital fabrication technologies such as laser cutters have been widely used for supporting prototyping of interactive devices as they are able to work with a wide range of materials. However, the majority of laser cut prototype components are often unable to support interaction or visualisation capabilities within themselves (e.g. functionality embedded within the material). Often materials that are laser cut do not have functional properties aside from serving as enclosures for interactive components. Our work explores how optical properties of clear Perspex material can be exploited to support interaction and visualisation capabilities for interface prototyping. Our proposed fabrication approach demonstrates the potential to support the development of novel displays devices that do not require expensive or complex circuitry and electronics. We produce a light-sensitive button and a seven-segment display which are combined into a wearable watch prototype demo. We also discuss design implications and future direction for this work.",

      "abstract": "Drawing as an activity aids problem solving, collaboration, and presentation in design, science, and engineering and artistic creativity as well as expression in the arts. Unfortunately, blind, and partially sighted learners still lack an inclusive and effective drawing tool, even in the digital age. In response, this research aims to explore what an effective drawing tool for blind and partially sighted individuals (BPSI) would be. Raised-line drawing kits aim to provide this, but in prior work, our usability tests of raised line graphics with blind and partially sighted participants rated the raised line graphics that we tested as barely comprehensible relative to 3D models, which they rated as highly comprehensible. Semi-structured interviews with our participants afterward suggest that they found 3D models to be more comprehensible because these are consistent with haptic principles of perception whereas conventions of raised line graphics, such as a line representing a surface edge, replicate visual cues of source images and thereby violate haptic principles of perception. Therefore, we hypothesize that a drawing tool for blind and partially sighted drawers could be effective by recruiting affordances of 3D models. Through co-design sessions conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic with blind and partially sighted drawers (BPSD), we prototyped a tangible 3D model construction kit for non-visual haptic drawing with a digital interface to a 3D virtual environment. Our current investigation of user needs is informing us of our ongoing iterative development of an accessible 3D scanning application that is enabling blind and partially sighted individuals to build and scan in 3D models constructed from a more flexible range of materials beyond what was possible with our previous prototype.

      "abstract": "This study proposes a method of fabricating jamming user interfaces using multi-material 3D printing. Through customized fabrication software, users can decide the properties of components of the interface, such as the size/shape of beads. The software automatically renders a membrane and an inner complex of beads after users decide the properties, which simplifies the manufacturing process of the jamming interface. Moreover, 3D printing allows the interface to have a double structure consisting of multiple rooms functioning jamming independently, which realizes a richer haptic experience. Finally, this paper describes the manufacturing process of the jamming interface using 3D modeling software/3D printing. It demonstrates the merits of this method with several applications, such as the haptic device and the shape-changing controller.",

      "abstract": "  In this study, we propose the design and implementation of a smart textile using conductive sequins produced by a 3D printer based on traditional sequin embroidery.\r\n\r\n  The well-designed conductive sequin smart textile, referred to as traditional sequin embroidery of various designs and diverse embroidery techniques, can break through the limitations of sequin fabric in its vertex modeling capability to create vertex-like sequins.\r\n\r\n  Using conductive and non-conductive resins, we printed out two types of sequins using a 3D printer, which are then combined and embroidered using the traditional sequin embroidery technique. When a force such as a touch or press is applied to the conductive sequins, a signal generated from the circuit, which those sequins themselves are part of,  will be sent to the computer. The computer can visualize the electric signals of this textile and sense the changes in the state of the textile.",

The individual data collected can be crowdsourced across urban landscapes and used by entities designed to provide therapeutic and protective response mechanisms. This bio-designed garment is meant to be a subversion of the hoodie, typically worn throughout the Black community. Through our speculative upcycling of the typical hoodie, we envision an Afro-futurist wearable design, to change the narrative of the social impact of wearing a hoodie while being Black. Our objective is to conceptualize the fabrication of wearable artifacts that convey properties of physical and physiological protection that can be used to make clothing relevant to marginalized, at risk populations.

      "abstract": "Workshops are frequently used in human-computer interaction research, in a diverse range of research projects. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has made this research activity difficult to conduct since they often involve group work, physical interaction with tangibles and/or bodily activity. Motivated by this, the authors conducted a review of papers from the International Conference on Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction (TEI) to develop a better understanding of workshops as a research method in TEI. The meta-review led to the development of a preliminary classification for workshops in research. Four categories of workshops were identified: Design development, Evaluation, Exploration, and Implementation. This work is intended to spark discussion and further research around the value and the challenges of conducting research workshops.",

In the process of exploring the possibilities within these digital modes of creation, many samples are made. To encourage cross-pollination between different practices and strive for a community that shares more information, this research investigates the state of the art of sample making and documentation practices in the context of Digital Craftsmanship. Through in-depth interviews with designers with a focus on digital craftsmanship, in this paper we unpack some of the practices and challenges in material driven processes related to how to design, evaluate, document and archive material samples. We reflect on making practices, what forms of knowledge are produced through making and how the use of samples in different design processes can be supported through documentation.",

This dialogue with tangible traces uses photography in conversation with tangible body maps (TBMs) towards harvesting evocative content for exploration. This dialogical tool functions as a way of generating conceptual knowledge inspired by the self and environment, including other subjectivities. This dialogue with tangible traces contributes to first-person design research, where traceability and communicability of outcomes become necessary preconditions for rigour. Although systematic, this method also respects the non-prescriptive and drifting nature of design.",

The system aims to support awareness of our digestive processes and help users to make informed decisions about their dietary choices. Digestive Tumble consists of nine modules, where the modules visualise a unique stage of the digestion. The system represents the digestion of five major food groups: grains, meat, vegetables, fruits and dairy through colourful tokens. Users interact with the system by inserting tokens representing their meal. These tokens transform into colourful beads, which then traverse through different modules to show the digestion of the given meal. We reflect upon the steps involved in visualising an internal bodily process through a tangible system. We hope that our design reflection will inspire future systems on visualising other internal bodily processes to support body learning through everyday reflection.",

Adoption of interactive textiles is complex requiring a combination of competences or collaboration between interaction designers, textile designers and textile engineers. These disciplines are typically organized in separate and unconnected departments, using different vocabularies, and requiring different information. Through focus groups with interaction designers, and interviews with experts from the three domains we developed the Interactive Textile Library (ITL). The ITL is a multi-disciplinary tool combining physical samples and a digital platform showing material characteristics, experiential qualities, interactive technology, manufacturing process and support to create and hack the samples. The ITL was evaluated with professional designers who valued the physical samples and videos. Results provide recommendations for researchers developing interactive textile material libraries that could facilitate incorporation of interactive textiles in design practice and reduce fabrication time of prototypes.",

      "abstract": "4D printing is a new technique for human-computer interaction to create self bending and actuating interfaces, leveraging the properties of 3D printed materials for shape change over time, triggered by external factors such as heat. Given the ubiquity of low-cost 3D printers, we see an opportunity to translate 4D printing from the research lab into makerspaces and educational settings. In this work, we explore low cost 4D printing with shape memory polymers and desktop 3D printers, tackling hybrid fabrication approach to lower the barrier for non-experts. \r\nWe see heat as one promising way of creating shape changing behaviors using common triggering methods such as oven, hair dryer, hot water. We present the initial design space for hybrid fabrication with factors that help characterize and control bending behaviors, showcasing potential design contexts with 4D printed applications.",

      "abstract": "As covid-19 spread worldwide, the growing trend to reduce people's mobility and the establishment of new lifestyles such as remote work, contactless communication systems have been required. Using a projected hand makes it possible to realize remote communication with a sense of presence without loading a user's physical body. However, conventional projected hand systems have a problem that the relative brightness of the hand image in a bright living room is low. Therefore, we propose a configuration that combines a video call system and a contour-based projected hand by a laser scanning projector. In addition, we incorporate a haptic feedback system with a tablet PC to improve the sense of contact with remote objects. To enhance the sense of contact in remote areas, we focus on providing the transition between hovering and contact states of the contour-based projected hand and users' hands. According to the experiment, we confirmed that there is a possibility to express hovering and contact even with simple swinging flat-panel feedback and visual effects of the contour-based projected hand.",

Yet, current research has neglected its potential to support not only active players but also coaches in their training methods. To investigate how interactive technologies can support skill acquisition in training, we designed an Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) system that helps maintain the ready position in crossminton. We compared the system with a vibrotactile solution in a user study, interviewing novice players and experienced coaches about their perception of the system. The system allowed coaches to effectively and immediately guide players to the ready position. An EMS-based feedback system for coaches can potentially reduce delay (physical and cognitive) for trainees, as stated by coaches. Our work contributes insights into designing systems that facilitate learning sports techniques using interactive feedback.",

      "abstract": "After the successful organization of the first TEI Swatch Exchange as part of the SDC (Student Design Challenge) in 2021, we would like to propose a swatch exchange as a new and physical publication format to TEI, the Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction.\r\nWe believe TEI should take initiative in exploring possibilities of broadening how academic publishing may look like and what novel publication format could be inclusive towards new knowledge and participants to advance academic practices. Furthermore, the focus and nature of the work presented at TEI is uniquely fitted to explore physical publication formats as a novel way to advance, communicate, and cite work that is bridging computing with the physical world. However, we are aware that a physical publication format also poses very specific challenges, there included questions of dissemination, accessibility, and citation, among others. \r\nWe propose a Studio to deeply engage with the possibilities, potentials, as well as potential problems of physical publication format as a crucial step towards defining plausible processes, forms, and archives for a physical research publication.\r\n",

However, we do not know what design decisions of fashion technology garments and runway show elements affect how messages of social issues are translated to the audience. My thesis work aims to understand how the design and presentation of fashion technology garments can create a deeper understanding of these messages in the audience. In this work, I outline the process of understanding technology for awareness and how the runway conveys activism through fashion technology. I also present two project designs to explore (I) the creation of an activism fashion technology garment for the runway and (II) ways to make runway events more interactive. ",

The goal is to suggest novel interaction methods that first capture the intent from people’s communicated gestures, and then express those intentions more effectively to other virtual meeting attendees as informative video filter responses. By combining interpreted physical gestures as input and informative video filters as output, I hope my research can bring a greater dimension in how people express their embodied interactions beyond the constraints of current virtual meeting environments.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces my PhD research on the relationship which vocalists have with their voice. The voice, both instrument and body, provides a unique perspective to examine embodied practice. The interaction with the voice is largely without physical interface and it is difficult to describe the sensation of singing; however, voice pedagogy has been successful at using metaphor to communicate sensory experience between student and teacher. I examine the voice through several different perspectives, including experiential physiological, and communicative interactions, and explore how we convey sensations in voice pedagogy and how perception of the body is shaped through experience with it. Further, through externalising internal movement using sonified surface electromyography, I aim to give presence to aspects of vocal movement which have become subconscious or automatic. The findings of this PhD will provide clearer understanding of how we discuss and perceive the experience living within and performing through our bodies.",

Since their invention, these 3-axis CNC machines have been connecting digital and analog creation. Plotters have great potential as a tool to bridge the digital-physical divide, allowing learners from a variety of backgrounds to gain immediate satisfaction from their programming by translating digital output into physical artifacts. In addition, due to their roots in art, plotters may be more inviting to students from artistic backgrounds new to programming. In this studio, we investigate plotters' potential in introducing creative programming in collaborative learning environments. By introducing collaborative creative programming through the lens of plotters, we explore solutions to challenges in programming education, collaborative programming, and personal fabrication. ",

      "abstract": "Explainable AI (XAI) seeks to disclose how an AI system arrives at its outcomes. But the nature of the disclosure depends in part on who needs to understand the AI and the available explanation modalities (e. g. verbal and visual). People's preferences regarding explanation modalities might differ, some might prefer spoken explanations compared to visual ones. However, we might also consider broadening the explanation modalities, to consider also tangible and physical forms. Historically, physical forms have mediated people’s interactions with objects, and more recently user interaction with IoT and smart devices, such as smart lighting and robotic vacuum cleaners. But whether it can support AI explanations has not yet been explored.\r\n\r\nIn this second studio proposal on Graspable AI (GAI) we seek to explore design qualities of physical forms as an explanation modality for XAI. We anticipate that the design qualities of physical forms and their tangible interactivities can not only contribute to the explainability of AI through facilitating dialogues and relationships and human empowerments, but also contributing to an open environment for criticism. Therefore, our proposal on Graspable AI seeks to contribute to the design agendas for a more transparent, democratic and sustainable AI.\r\n",

We wanted to incorporate used paper in our machine to make it eco/friendly. Every house uses tissues in abundance, and we wanted to reduce the carbon footprint tissue paper leaves behind, an additional bonus is that people will not have to spend more money for tissues. Fabrication machines have been difficult to bring to the general people and we wanted to make something accessible and easy to use. \r\nThe aim of our tissue paper fabricator machine is to sustainably produce a lightweight sheet of paper that is soft, absorbent, and strong enough to fulfill the functions needed, and which can then be converted into finished products which can be accepted by households worldwide.\r\n",

We investigated this social problem from an artistic point of view and studied the method of embodying the concept into an artwork that can interact with the audience. The work is composed of a helmet-like mechanical wearable device that produces pains for the audience when he/she wears it and the software visualization that varies depending on the heart rate of the audience in the process of pain and anxiety while wearing the device.  Technically, we utilized 3D printing in designing the mechanical device, robotics for the kinetic hands as well as biometric sensor data visualization of heart rate sensor. ",

Catharsis and playfulness of building for one’s own home should not be limited to those who have the luxury of time and money to afford it, and can be enabled for all through generation of strong paper “building blocks” that can be fitted together to build customizable pieces. This paper aims to resolve issues by democratizing the creative process, fabrication, and cost of current furniture design. This will be done through user fabricated sleek modular furniture solutions with eco-friendly folded paper material inspired by traditional “Kirigami” papercraft. Further on, this research tackles elimination of wastefulness through disassembly, reassembly, or recycling of the building blocks themselves, which overall enables more options for personal fabrication in the home.",

      "abstract": "Over recent decades, rapid urbanization has made people further detached from nature. Researchers from a wide range of disciplines have demonstrated that the growing separateness from nature has adverse impacts on public health and environmental sustainability. Therefore, promoting nature connectedness has been viewed as a prominent and necessary aspiration. Since more and more people live in cities and spend most of their time indoors, urban landscapes and citizens' living environments play an increasingly important role in reconnecting to nature. Under these circumstances, the project aims to use design and technology to gently intervene in people's perceptive and behavioral transformations by encouraging them to notice, value, and have more contact with the nearby nature, as well as deliver nature’s restorative effects. A prototype was developed after a cultural probes study, connecting the natural environment with the home space, the digital device with the tangible interaction, the real-life behaviors with the virtual effects.",

      "abstract": "Arguments for and against action in regards to climate change are deeply rooted in predetermined emotional responses, making it difficult to counter climate change denial armed only with objective data and scientific evidence. Interactive games, however, can engage people on an unconscious level, by promoting causes that align with the player’s intrinsic motivations in the interaction. Instead of argumentation and data, we created a game exhibit that promotes the values that align with pro-climate action without explicitly persuading for climate action. We designed Chikyuchi based on the purpose of caring for a nonhuman entity that represents nature, engaging antagonistic viewpoints like climate change denial indirectly. The game uses the guise of a Tamagotchi to enable audiences to take pro-climate actions metaphorically in the interaction with the avatar. Audiences understand the game as communicating care-taking in the context of the environment as opposed to a physical intervention in depletion of resource. They also collaborate in taking pro-social actions using the game instrument, sharing their purpose on a human level as opposed to debating about policy.",

It is inspired by the works and ideas of the American artist Agnes Martin. The work consists of 6 large movements (5 + 1), which can be performed in any order. The spectator decides this order and can interfere with the performance through an interactive UI-layer on top of a livestream. Empty Mind is a composition by Wim Henderickx for flutes (piccolo, flute, alto flute and bass flute) and live electronics. In each movement there is a strictly composed passage that represents a continuity between the parts and several free passages where the piece has the space and freedom to develop on its own - chosen by the soloist at that moment - creating a discontinuity. Flutist Ine Vanoeveren performs in a motion capture suit with which she controls the virtual environment. The performance in the virtual spaces is being filmed by a handheld, virtual camera and directly streamed onto Twitch. This livestream is the live feed for the audience, with the interactive layer on top of the video.",

The goal of the experience is to provide an embodied way for attendees to explore technosocial issues around algorithmic decision making and habitual technology use and discuss them in an open, facilitated context. The embodied aspects of movement creation provide a dedicated space for reflection and relation to others.

In July 2021 we launched The Life of a Building at the Ottawa Art Gallery in Ottawa, Canada, which knits visitor data at the physical gallery as well as online interactions on the gallery website. Each month the colour of the yarn changes, creating a tangible, soft record of this unpredictable year. During TEI, the audience will be able to visit the gallery website, click a button to create their own row of stitches on the machine, and watch the knitting machine knit them into the installation through the livestream.",
