      "abstract": "The post-college transition is a critical period where individuals experience unique challenges and stress before, during, and after graduation. Individuals often use social media to discuss and share information, advice, and support related to post-college challenges in online communities. These communities are important as they fill gaps in institutional support between college and post-college plans. We empirically study the challenges and stress expressed on social media around this transition as students graduate college and move into emerging adulthood. We assembled a dataset of about 299,000 Reddit posts between 2008 and 2020 about the post-college transition from 10 subreddits. We extracted top concerns, challenges, and conversation points using unsupervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Then, we combined the results of LDA with binary transfer learning to identify stress expressions in the dataset (classifier performance at F1=0.94). Finally, we explore temporal patterns in stress expressions and the variance of per-topic stress levels throughout the year. Our work highlights a more deliberate and focused understanding of the post-college transition, as well as useful research and design impacts to study transient cohorts in need of support.",

We contribute a Model of Socially Sustained Self-Tracking in personal informatics, building on the past model of Personal Informatics and the learning components of Social Cognitive Theory. The model illustrates how people get advice from social platforms on when and how to track, transfer data to and apply knowledge from social platforms, evolve to use social platforms after tracking, and occasionally resume using tracking tools. Observational learning and enactive learning are central to these processes, with social technologies helping people to gain deeper and more reliable domain knowledge. We discuss how lapsing and abandoning of tracking can be viewed as evolving to social platforms, offering recommendations for how technology can better facilitate this evolution.",

      "abstract": "The proliferation of harmful content on online social media platforms has necessitated empirical understandings of experiences of harm online and the development of practices for harm mitigation. Both understandings of harm and approaches to mitigating that harm, often through content moderation, have implicitly embedded frameworks of prioritization—what forms of harm should be researched, how policy on harmful content should be implemented, and how harmful content should be moderated. To aid efforts of better understanding the variety of online harms, how they relate to one another, and how to prioritize harms relevant to research, policy, and practice, we present a theoretical framework of severity for harmful online content. By employing a grounded theory approach, we developed a framework of severity based on interviews and card-sorting activities conducted with 52 participants over the course of ten months. Through our analysis, we identified four Types of Harm (physical, emotional, relational, and financial) and eight Dimensions along which the severity of harm can be understood (perspectives, intent, agency, experience, scale, urgency, vulnerability, sphere). We describe how our framework can be applied to both research and policy settings towards deeper understandings of specific forms of harm (e.g., harassment) and prioritization frameworks when implementing policies encompassing many forms of harm.

      "abstract": "Online technologies offer great promise to expand models of delivery for therapeutic interventions to help users cope with increasingly common mental illnesses like anxiety and depression. For example, \"cognitive reappraisal\" is a skill that involves changing one's perspective on negative thoughts in order to improve one's emotional state. In this work, we present Flip*Doubt, a novel crowd-powered web application that provides users with cognitive reappraisals (\"reframes\") of negative thoughts. A one-month field deployment of Flip*Doubt with 13 graduate students yielded a data set of negative thoughts paired with positive reframes, as well as rich interview data about how participants interacted with the system. Through this deployment, our work contributes: (1) an in-depth qualitative understanding of how participants used a crowd-powered cognitive reappraisal system in the wild; and (2) detailed codebooks that capture informative context about negative input thoughts and reframes. Our results surface data-derived hypotheses that may help to explain what types of reframes are helpful for users, while also providing guidance to future researchers and developers interested in building collaborative systems for mental health. In our discussion, we outline implications for systems research to leverage peer training and support, as well as opportunities to integrate AI/ML-based algorithms to support the cognitive reappraisal task. (Note: This paper includes potentially triggering mentions of mental health issues and suicide.)",

      "abstract": "Journalists are routinely challenged with monitoring vast information environments in order to identify what is newsworthy and of interest to report to a wider audience. In a process referred to as computational news discovery, alerts and leads based on data-driven algorithmic analysis can orient journalists' attention to events, documents, or anomalous patterns in data that are more likely to be newsworthy. In this paper we prototype one such news discovery tool, Algorithm Tips, which we designed to help journalists find newsworthy leads about algorithmic decision-making systems used across all levels of U.S. government. The tool incorporates algorithmic, crowdsourced, and expert evaluations into an integrated interface designed to support users in making editorial decisions about which news leads to pursue. We then present an evaluation of our prototype based on an extended deployment with eight professional journalists. Our findings offer insights into journalistic practices that are enabled and transformed by such news discovery tools, and suggest opportunities for improving computational news discovery tool designs to better support those practices. \r\n",

      "abstract": "Contact tracing apps have been suggested as a promising approach towards containing viral spread during pandemics, yet their actual use in the COVID-19 pandemic has been low. While researchers have examined reasons for or against installing contact tracing apps, we have less understanding of their ongoing use and how they interact with everyday pressures related to work, communities, and mental well-being. Through a survey of 153 working people in Japan and 15 follow-up interviews, we investigated attitudes toward installing and using Japan's national contact tracing app, COCOA, and how these related to respondents’ daily lives, work structures, and general attitudes about the pandemic. We found that motivations about installing the app differed from those related to ongoing usage. Specifically, we identified ways that people navigate uncertain norms of behaviour during the pandemic, and how people consider individual risks such as COVID-related stigmas, anxiety, and financial precarity when deciding if and how to use COCOA. In light of these, we discuss the tension between COCOA's design and desires to protect oneself by selective controlling disclosures. We note that perceived risks are closely tied to respondents' local contexts, and based on our analysis, we identify ways to address these challenges and tensions through design interventions at multiple scales.",

      "abstract": "Struggling to curb misinformation, social media platforms are experimenting with design interventions to enhance consumption of credible news on their platforms. Some of these interventions, such as the use of warning messages, are examples of nudges---a choice-preserving technique to steer behavior. Despite their application, we do not know whether nudges could steer people into making conscious news credibility judgments online and if they do, under what constraints. To answer, we combine nudge techniques with heuristic based information processing to design NudgeCred--a browser extension for Twitter. NudgeCred directs users' attention to two design cues: authority of a source and other users' collective opinion on a report by activating three design nudges---Reliable, Questionable, and Unreliable, each denoting particular levels of credibility for news tweets. In a controlled experiment, we found that NudgeCred significantly helped users (n=430) distinguish news tweets' credibility, unrestricted by three behavioral confounds---political ideology, political cynicism, and media skepticism. A five-day field deployment with twelve participants revealed that NudgeCred improved their recognition of news items and attention towards all of our nudges, particularly towards Questionable. Among other considerations, participants proposed that designers should incorporate heuristics that users' would trust. Our work informs nudge-based system design approaches for online media.",

      "abstract": "The future of crowd work has been identified to depend on worker satisfaction, but we lack a thorough understanding of how worker satisfaction can be increased in microtask crowdsourcing. Prior work has shown that one solution is to build tasks that are engaging. To facilitate engagement, two methods that have received attention in recent HCI literature are the use of video games and conversational interfaces.  While these are largely different techniques, they aim for the same goal of reducing worker burden and increasing engagement in a task. On one hand, video games have huge motivation potential and translating game design elements for motivational purposes has shown positive effects. Recent work in games research has shown that the use of player avatars is effective in fostering interest, enjoyment, and other aspects pertaining to intrinsic motivation. On the other hand, conversational interfaces have been argued to have advantages over traditional GUIs due to facilitating a more human-like interaction. `Conversational' microtasking has recently been proposed to improve worker engagement in microtask marketplaces. The contexts of games and crowd work are underlined by the need to motivate and engage participants, yet the potential of using worker avatars to promote self-identification and improve worker satisfaction in microtask crowdsourcing has remained unexplored. Addressing this knowledge gap, we carried out a between-subjects study involving 360 crowd workers. We investigated how worker avatars influence quality related outcomes of workers and their perceived experience, in conventional web and novel conversational interfaces. We equipped workers with the functionality of customizing their avatars, and selecting characterizations for their avatars, to understand whether identifying with an avatar can increase the motivation of workers. We found evidence that using worker avatars can significantly reduce workers' perceived task difficulty in information findings tasks across both web and conversational interfaces. We also found that using worker avatars with conversational interfaces can effectively reduce cognitive workload, increase worker intrinsic motivation, and increase worker retention. Our findings have important implications in alleviating workers' perceived workload, building their self-confidence, and on the design of crowdsourcing microtasks.",

      "abstract": "The social computing community has demonstrated interest in the ethical issues sometimes produced by machine learning (ML) models, like violations of privacy, fairness, and accountability. This paper discovers what kinds of ethical considerations machine learning engineers recognize, how they build understanding, and what decisions they make when working with a real-world dataset. In particular, it illustrates ways in which Datasheets for Datasets, an accountability intervention designed to help engineers explore unfamiliar training data, scaffolds the process of issue discovery, understanding, and ethical decision-making. Participants were asked to review an intentionally ethically problematic dataset and asked to think aloud as they used it to solve a given ML problem. Out of 23 participants, 11 were given a Datasheet they could use while completing the task. Participants were ethically sensitive enough to identify concerns in the dataset; participants who had a Datasheet did open and refer to it; and those with Datasheets mentioned ethical issues during the think-aloud earlier and more often than than those without. The think-aloud protocol offered a grounded description of how participants recognized, understood, and made a decision about ethical problems in an unfamiliar dataset. The method used in this study can test other interventions that claim to encourage recognition, promote understanding, and support decision-making among technologists.",

      "abstract": "Causal knowledge is of interest in many areas, such as statistics and machine learning, as it allows people and algorithms to predict outcomes and make data-driven decisions. Researchers in CSCW have proposed tools and workflows to externalize causal knowledge or beliefs from a group of people; however, most of the generated causal diagrams lack a deeper understanding of the causal mechanisms or could not capture diverse beliefs. By integrating narratives with causal diagrams, we implemented an interactive system that allows users to 1) write narratives to rationalize their perceived causal relationships, 2) visualize their causal models using directed diagrams, and 3) review and utilize others' causal diagrams and narratives. We conducted a user study (N=20) to learn how participants leveraged this integrated approach to externalize their perceived causal models for a given application context. Our results showed that the approach implemented in our tool enabled the externalization of users' causal beliefs (e.g., how and why a causal relationship might occur), allowed blind spots of individuals' causal reasoning to be revealed (e.g., learning new ideas from peers), and inspired their causal reasoning (e.g., revising or adding new causal relationships). We also identified the individual differences in people's causal beliefs and observed the impacts of showing others' causal models when one is building their causal diagram and narratives. This work provides practical design implications for developing collaborative tools that facilitate capturing and sharing causal beliefs.",

      "abstract": "The increased use of algorithms to support decision making raises questions about whether people prefer algorithmic or human input when making decisions. Two streams of research on algorithm aversion and algorithm appreciation have yielded contradicting results. Our work attempts to reconcile this conflict by focusing on the framings of humans and algorithms as a mechanism. In three decision making experiments, we created an algorithm appreciation result (Experiment 1) as well as an algorithm aversion result (Experiment 2) by manipulating only the description of the human agent and the algorithmic agent, and we demonstrated how different choices of framings can lead to inconsistent results in previous studies (Experiment 3). We also showed that these results were mediated by the agent's perceived competence, i.e., expert power. The results provide insights into the divergence of the algorithm aversion and algorithm appreciation literature. We hope to shift the attention from these two contradicting phenomena to how we can better design the framing of algorithms. We also call the attention of the community to the theory of power sources, as it can be a useful framework for designing algorithmic decision support systems.",

      "abstract": "Since 2015, an increased number of asylum seekers is coming to Europe. These migration movements increasingly rely on digital infrastructure, such as mobile internet access and online services, in order to reach their targeted destination countries. Asylum seekers often use smartphones for information and communication purposes. Even though there are many positive aspects in the use of such technologies, researchers have to consider the perceived risks of this specific user group. This work aims at investigating the use of mobile information technologies by asylum seekers during their flight, especially taking privacy into account. Thus, it examines asylum seekers’ digital privacy perceptions and identifies privacy protection behaviors by conducting a qualitative interview study with 14 asylum seekers who applied for asylum in Germany. The results show that asylum seekers are often aware of the various risks deriving from the use of smartphones and ICT, such as surveillance and persecution by state or non-state actors as well as extortion by criminals. Based on this, this work further more outlines different strategies used to manage these risks. Since the lack of privacy and trust leads to avoidance behavior, the insights of this study provide valuable information for the design of assistance apps and collaboration platforms, which appropriately address the specific needs for digital privacy in the context of flight, or for the conception of privacy-enhancing technologies helping to achieve this.",

      "abstract": "New technology is moving towards intuitive and natural interaction techniques that are increasingly embedded in human space (e.g., home and office environment) and aims to support multiple users, yet their interfaces do not cover it to the full. Imagine that you have a multi-user device, should it act differently in different situations, people, and group settings? Current Multi-User Interfaces address each of the users as an individual that works independently from others, and there is a lack of understanding of the mechanisms that impact shared usage of these products. Thus we have linked environmental (external) and user-centered (internal) factors to the way users interact with multi-user devices. We analyzed 124 papers that involve multi-user interfaces and created a classification model out of 8 factors. Both the model and factors were validated by a large-scale online study. Our model defines the factors affecting multi-user usage with a single device and leads to a decision on the most important ones in different situations. This paper is the first to identify these factors and to create a set of practical guidelines for designing Multi-User Interfaces.",

      "abstract": "This paper contributes to the development of an under-utilized area of focus for CSCW research and design: history. The design and evaluation of technology, as practiced in the field, has positioned CSCW as a largely forward-looking community. The enduring ‘presentism’ and lack of historical view threatens to leave out a wealth of resources that can inspire design, support comparative analysis, and develop a deeper understanding of technology development and its social consequences. This paper argues that a historicist sensibility should inform the due diligence of all CSCW research, and we present connection points for the various ways in which historical research might more deeply inform CSCW, while offering a selection of historiographic challenges to sensitize CSCW scholars as we seek to better situate our collective work within both the present moment as well as ongoing temporal change.

This study aims to come to an understanding of how various stakeholders interact with each other in tricking algorithms, with a focus towards online review communities. We employed a mixed-method approach in order to explore how and why users write machine non-translatable reviews as well as how those encrypted messages are perceived by those receiving them. We found that users are able to find tactics to trick the algorithms in order to avoid censoring, to mitigate interpersonal burden, to protect privacy, and to provide authentic information for enabling the formation of informative review communities. They apply several linguistic and social strategies in this regard. Furthermore, users perceive encrypted messages as both more trustworthy and authentic. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for online review community and content moderation algorithms.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Gab is an online social network often associated with the alt-right political movement and users barred from other networks. It presents an interesting opportunity for research because near-complete data is available from day one of the network’s creation. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the user interaction graph, that is the graph where a link represents a user interacting with  another user at a given time. We view this graph both at different times and at different timescales. The latter is achieved by using sliding windows on the graph which gives a novel perspective on social network data. The Gab network is relatively slowly growing over the period of months but subject to large bursts of arrivals over hours and days. We identify plausible events that are of interest to the Gab community associated with the most obvious such bursts. The network is characterised by interactions between ‘strangers’ rather than by reinforcing links between ‘friends’. Gab usage follows the diurnal cycle of the predominantly US and Europe based users. At off-peak hours the Gab interaction network fragments into sub-networks with absolutely no interaction between them. A small group of users are highly influential across larger timescales, but a substantial number of users gain influence for short periods of time. Temporal analysis at different timescales gives new insights above and beyond what could be found on static graphs.",

      "abstract": "The recommender system (RS), as a computer-supported information filtering system, is ubiquitous and influences what we eat, watch, or even like. In online RS, interactions between users and the system form a feedback loop: users take actions based on the recommendations provided by RS, and RS updates its recommendations accordingly. As such interactions increase, the issue of recommendation homogeneity intensifies, which significantly impairs user experience. In the face of this long-standing issue, the newly-emerging social e-commerce offers a new solution -- bringing friends' recommendations into the loop (friend-in-the-loop). In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study on the benefits of friend-in-the-loop through mixed methods on a leading social e-commerce platform in China, Beidian. We reveal that friend-in-the-loop provides users with more accurate and diverse recommendations than merely RS, and significantly alleviates algorithmic homogeneity. Moreover, our qualitative results demonstrate that the introduction of friends' external knowledge, consumers' trust, and empathy accounts for these benefits. Overall, we elaborate that friend-in-the-loop comprehensively benefits both users and RS, and it is a promising HCI-based solution to recommendation homogeneity, which offers insightful implications on designing future human-algorithm collaboration models.",

      "abstract": "Over three billion people use personal email accounts for a wide variety of communications, largely from businesses. These messages often require additional information that users need to look for outside of the email itself, such as store hours, bill details, or related news articles. We studied these \"email-prompted information needs\" in a pilot interview-based study, a two-week diary study, and a large-scale survey with 790 total participants, finding that Notification, Deal, and Newsletter messages were the most likely to spark a need for external information. We conclude with several designs evaluated in a concept evaluation study with 276 participants and implications for the design of personal email services to better meet users’ external information needs.",

      "abstract": "User experience (UX) professionals’ attempts to address social values as a part of their work practice can overlap with tactics to contest, resist, or change the companies they work for. This paper studies tactics that take place in this overlap, where UX professionals try to re-shape the values embodied and promoted by their companies, in addition to the values embodied and promoted in the technical systems and products their companies produce. Through interviews with UX professionals working at large U.S.-based technology companies and observations at UX meetup events, this paper identifies tactics used towards three goals: (1) creating space for UX expertise to address values; (2) making values visible and relevant to other organizational stakeholders; and (3) changing organizational processes and orientations towards values. This paper analyzes these as tactics of resistance: UX professionals seek to subvert or change existing practices and organizational structures towards more values-conscious ends. Yet, these tactics of resistance often rely on the dominant discourses and logics of the technology industry. The paper characterizes these tactics as partial or “soft,” but also argues that they nevertheless hold possibilities for enacting values-oriented changes.",

      "abstract": "‘Big data’ corpora are typically the purview of quantitative scholars, who may work with computational tools to derive numerical and descriptive insights. Recent work asks how technology, such as AI, can support qualitative scholars in developing deep and complex insights from large datasets. Jiang et al. address this question, finding that qualitative scholars are generally opposed to using AI to support their practices of data analysis. However, in this paper, we provide nuance to these earlier findings, showing that the stage of qualitative analysis matters for how scholars feel AI can, and should be, used. Through interviews with 15 CSCW and HCI researchers who engage with qualitative analysis of large corpora, we examine AI use at different stages of qualitative analysis. We find that qualitative scholars are open to using AI in diverse ways, such as for data exploration and coding, as long as it supports rather than automates their analytic work practice. Based on our analysis, we discuss how the incorporation of AI can shift some qualitative analysis practices as well as how designing for human-AI collaboration in qualitative analysis necessitates considering the tradeoffs in designing for scale, abstraction, and task delegation.",

      "abstract": "Emergency medical services (EMS) teams are first responders providing urgent medical care to severely ill or injured patients in the field. Despite their criticality, EMS work is one of the very few medical domains with limited technical support. This paper describes a study conducted to examine technology opportunities for supporting EMS data work and decision-making. We transcribed and analyzed 25 simulation videos. Using the distributed cognition framework, we examined EMS teams’ work practices that support information acquisition and sharing. Our results showed that EMS teams leveraged various mechanisms (e.g., verbal communication and external cognitive aids) to distribute cognitive labor in managing, collecting, and using patient data. However, we observed a set of prominent challenges in EMS data work, including lack of detailed documentation in real time, situation recall issues, situation awareness problems, and challenges in decision making and communication. Based on the results, we discuss implications for technology opportunities to support rapid information acquisition, integration, and sharing in time-critical, high-risk medical settings.",

      "abstract": "Cross-partisan conversations are central to a vibrant democracy, allowing citizens to engage with alternate perspectives and form considered opinions. However, in the United States, amidst unprecedented levels of partisan animosity, these conversations are especially hard to have. In online spaces, such interactions often devolve into name-calling and personal attacks. We report on a qualitative study of 17 US residents who have engaged with outpartisans on Reddit, to understand their expectations and the strategies they adopt in such interactions. We find that users have multiple, sometimes contradictory expectations of these conversations, ranging from deliberative discussions to entertainment and banter, which adds to the challenge of finding conversations they like. Through experience, users have refined multiple strategies for fostering good cross-partisan engagement. Contrary to offline settings where knowing about the interlocutor can help manage disagreements, on Reddit, some users look to actively learn as little as possible about their outpartisan interlocutors for fear that such information may bias their interactions. Through design probes about hypothetical features intended to reduce partisan hostility, we find that users are actually open to knowing certain kinds of information about their interlocutors, such as non-political subreddits that they both participate in, and to having that information made visible to their interlocutors. However, making other information visible, such as the other subreddits that they participate in or previous comments they posted, though potentially humanizing, raises concerns around privacy and misuse of that information for personal attacks.",

      "abstract": "Hyperlocal information systems cater to the needs of the people in a well-defined geographical area. Such information systems are ubiquitously accessible to the users in the developed world through their mobile phones. In developing countries hyperlocal information is valued, but often dispersed, constantly evolving, and poorly accessible. Additionally, most of the social information systems in developing countries are adopted from the developed world, and often fail to take into consideration local socio-geographical settings and cultural complexities. As a result, there is a strong reliance on word of mouth through known and unknown networks. In this paper, we present foundational insights on user needs, behaviors and motivations for the design of hyperlocal information systems in developing countries based on a multi-year, multi-method research study with around 5000 participants in three such countries - India, Indonesia and Nigeria. We also discuss how the complexity of real world sociocultural phenomena and heterogeneity of neighborhoods impact hyperlocal information, which can further inform design of such systems in the future.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Because of the increasingly negative impacts of the echo chamber effect, such as the dissemination of fake news and political polarization occurring in social networking services (SNSs), considerable efforts are being made to mitigate this effect. Prior HCI studies have presented the development of user interfaces to display information that reflects various standpoints, with the aim of nudging people to consume information in a more objective fashion. However, these efforts still lack the ability to highlight the characteristics, generation processes, and negative effects of echo chambers, so they may not be effective in helping people become sufficiently aware of the echo chamber effect and those who are already in an echo chamber. In this paper, we present ChamberBreaker (CB), which has been designed to help increase a player's awareness of and preemptively respond to an echo chamber effect based on psychological concepts: inoculation, heuristics for judging, and gamification. Through a user study with 882 participants (control group: 446, experimental group: 436), we demonstrated the feasibility of our game-based methodology to support the awareness of the echo chamber effect and the importance of maintaining diverse perspectives when consuming information. Our findings highlight the externalization of psychological standpoints in mitigating an echo chamber effect and suggest design implications for system development---the consideration of demographics, playing time, and the connection to fake news recognition---for digital literacy education.

      "abstract": "Co-design methods have involved older adults in the design process to fill the knowledge gap that younger adult designers might encounter when designing for an aging population. A focus of co-design means establishing equal and equitable relationships be-tween users and designers. To understand the factors that contribute to equal collaborations between older adults and student de-signers, we conducted 12 co-design sessions with 16 older adults and 11 student designers. We examined their interactions by adapt-ing a framework initially aimed to understand the child-adult design partnership. We also analyzed student designers' reflections to understand their experiences and learnings from designing with older adults. Our findings demonstrate that developing a design partnership is complex. The framework helped surface factors like sharing life experiences and role ownership that influenced bal-anced or unbalanced interactions. Through the student designers' reflections, we found that student designers identified challenges they encountered and the assumptions they had about the older adult population. We believe that immersing students in a co-design experience with older adults and leveraging reflection activities provides an educational and meaningful experience to the design students.",

      "abstract": "Cyberbullying is a growing problem across social media platforms, inflicting short and long-lasting effects on victims. As such, research has looked into building automated systems, powered by machine learning, to detect cyberbullying incidents, or the involved actors like victims and perpetrators. In the past, systematic reviews have examined the approaches within this growing body of work, but with a focus on the computational aspects of the technical innovation, feature engineering, or performance optimization, without centering around humans’ roles, beliefs, desires, or expectations. In this paper, we present a human-centered systematic literature review of the past 10 years of research on automated cyberbullying detection. We analyzed 56 papers based on a three-prong human-centeredness algorithm design framework – spanning theoretical, participatory, and speculative design. We found that the past literature fell short of incorporating human-centeredness across multiple aspects, ranging from defining cyberbullying, establishing the ground truth in data annotation, evaluating the performance of the detection models, to speculating the usage and users of the models, including potential harms and negative consequences. Given the sensitivities of the cyberbullying experience and the deep ramifications cyberbullying incidents bear on the involved actors, we discuss takeaways on how incorporating human-centeredness in future research can aid with developing detection systems that are more practical, useful, and tuned to the diverse needs and contexts of the stakeholders.",

      "abstract": "This paper reports an interview study about how consent to sexual activity is computer-mediated. The study’s context of online dating is chosen due to the prevalence of sexual violence, or nonconsensual sexual activity, that is associated with dating app-use. Participants (n=19) represent a range of gender identities and sexual orientations, and predominantly used the dating app Tinder. Findings reveal two computer-mediated consent processes: consent signaling and affirmative consent. With consent signaling, users employed Tinder’s interface to infer and imply agreement to sex without any explicit confirmation before making sexual advances in-person. With affirmative consent, users employed the interface to establish patterns of overt discourse around sex and consent across online and offline modalities. The paper elucidates shortcomings of both computer-mediated consent processes that leave users susceptible to sexual violence, and envisions dating apps as potential sexual violence prevention solutions if deliberately designed to mediate consent exchange.",

      "abstract": "Diverse fields, including CSCW, Communication, and Human Development studies, have investigated how technologies can better support parent-child relationships. While these studies are scattered across literature, little effort has been made to synthesize the findings. We conducted a review of studies that examined the factors associated with parent-child relationships that are mediated by technologies. Specifically, we synthesized previous studies based on children’s age groups and different family contexts, including cohabitation.  From a total of 12,942 search results from two databases, and 32 results from the hand-searching process, we conducted a full-text review of 190 articles and identified 19 suitable studies. An additional search during the revision cycle resulted in 6 more full-text reviews and 1 additional study being included in the data analysis. We analyzed challenges and facilitators in designing CSCW systems supporting parent-child relationships for families living together or apart and families with children of different developmental stages. Findings showed two common challenges, which should be addressed in technology designed to support parent-child relationships: discrepancies in expected communication between parents and child(ren) and the complex emotions of parents toward parenting caused by their busy schedules. Challenges specific to families who are living apart included consequences from being physically distant and having limited access to communication resources. The following factors commonly helped facilitate parent-child relationships: (1) reciprocity norms of the family (2) reinforcement of transparency, affection, and trust, (3) a physical proxy of each other through an object or interface design, (4) accessibility, the sophistication level of technology, and communication resources, (5) enjoyable, age-appropriate shared content among parents and children, and (6) situational awareness and routine as ways to increase parent-child relationships. Media richness and synchronicity in system design and privacy preservation without interruption facilitated parent-child relationships of families living apart. Based on the findings, we discuss opportunities for technological innovation for physically co-located families and the importance of considering children’s age and developmental stages in designing technology for parent-child relationships.

      "abstract": "Content moderation is an essential part of online community health and governance. While much of extant research is centered on what happens to the content, moderation also involves the management of violators. This study focuses on how moderators (mods) make decisions about their actions after the violation takes place but before the sanction by examining how they ``profile'' the violators. Through observations and interviews with volunteer mods on Twitch, we found that mods engage in a complex process of collaborative evidence collection and profile violators into different categories to decide the type and extent of punishment. Mods consider violators' characteristics as well as behavioral history and violation context before taking moderation action. The main purpose of the profiling was to avoid excessive punishment and aim to integrate violators more into the community. We discuss the contributions of profiling to moderation practice and suggest design mechanisms to facilitate mods' profiling processes. ",

      "abstract": "People often turn to online health communities (OHCs) for peer support on their specific medical conditions and health-related concerns. Over time, core members in OHCs build a shared understanding of the medical conditions they support. Although prior work has studied how individuals function differently in active sensemaking mode compared to habitual mode, little is known about how OHCs disseminate their advice once their core members operate primarily in habitual mode. We qualitatively observe one such OHC, `Surviving Antidepressants', to understand how collectively-built protocols are disseminated in the important domain of discontinuing psychiatric drugs. Psychiatric drugs are widely prescribed to treat mental health diagnoses, but, in certain cases, discontinuation might be clinically advisable. Unfortunately, some people experience severe withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation, even when following medical advice, and thus turn to OHCs for support. We find that collectively-built protocols resemble medical advice and are delivered in a top-down fashion, with staff members being the primary source of informational support. In contrast, all members provide emotional support and exchange advice on navigating the medical system, while many express their distrust of the medical community and pharmaceutical companies. We also discuss the implications of OHCs offering advice outside of the medical system and offer suggestions for how OHCs can collaborate with healthcare providers to advance scientific knowledge and better support people living with medical conditions.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Multi-touch spherical displays that enable groups of people to collaboratively interact are increasingly being used in informal learning environments such as museums. Prior research on large flatscreen displays has examined group collaboration patterns in museum settings to inform the design of group learning experiences around these displays. However, designing collaborative interfaces for multi-touch spherical displays remains challenging as we do not yet completely understand how visitor groups naturally collaborate around these displays in a naturalistic museum setting. The spherical form factor of the display affords new forms of collaboration: Unlike flatscreen displays, spherical displays do not have a definite front or center, thus intrinsically creating shared and private touch interaction areas on the display based on users’ viewing angles or physical arrangements. We conducted a 5-day long field study at a local science museum during which 571 visitors (370 adults and 201 children) in 211 groups interacted with a walk-up-and-use collaborative learning application showing global science data visualizations, on a multi-touch spherical display. We qualitatively analyzed groups’ natural collaboration patterns including their physical arrangements (F-formations), their collaboration profiles (e.g., turn-taker or independent), and the nature of group discussion around the display. Our results show that groups often engaged in both independent as well as closely collaborative group explorations when interacting around the sphere: physical spacing between group members around the sphere was strongly linked to the way groups collaborated. It was less common for group members to make and accept suggestions or coordinate touch interactions when they did not share the same field of view or touch interaction space around the sphere with each other. Our work will discuss implications for supporting group collaboration in this context and inform the design of future walk-up-and-use multi-touch spherical display applications for use in public settings.",

We study some commonly used measurement instruments that capture cultural dimensions at an individual level and conduct “measurement invariance tests,” which test whether the questions comprising a construct have similar characteristics across different groups (e.g., countries). We find that these cultural dimensions are, to some extent, non-invariant, making statistical comparisons between countries problematic. Furthermore, we study the (non)invariance of the causal relationship between these cultural dimensions and privacy-related constructs, e.g., privacy concern and the amount of information users share on social media. Our results suggest that in several instances, these cultural dimensions have a different effect on privacy-related constructs per country. This severely reduces their usefulness for developing cross-cultural arguments in cross-country studies. We discuss the value of conducting measurement and causal non-invariance tests and urge scholars to develop more robust means of measuring culture.  ",

      "abstract": "The life cycle of a peer-produced dataset follows the phases of growth, maturity, and decline. Paying crowdworkers is a proven method to collect and organize information into structured tables. However, these tabular representations may contain inaccuracies due to errors or data changing over time. Thus, the maturation phase of a dataset can benefit from the additional human examination. One method to improve accuracy is to recruit additional paid crowdworkers to verify and correct errors. An alternative method relies on unpaid contributors, collectively editing the dataset during regular use. We describe two case studies to examine different strategies for human verification and maintenance of in-flux tabular datasets. The first case study examines traditional micro-task verification strategies with paid crowdworkers, while the second examines long-term maintenance strategies with unpaid contributions from non-crowdworkers. Two paid verification strategies that produced more accurate corrections at a lower cost per accurate correction were redundant data collection followed by final verification from a trusted crowdworker and allowing crowdworkers to review any data freely. In the unpaid maintenance strategies, contributors provided more accurate corrections when asked to review data matching their interests. This research identifies considerations and future approaches to collectively improving information accuracy and longevity of tabular information.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we activate theoretical principles for HCI and CSCW in analysis and design of collaborative technologies. We critically evaluate theoretical principles about how technologies mediate collaborative activities through two empirical cases regarding smart speakers and collaborative writing, respectively.  Common to them is that both common objects and mediating artifacts are set in a mixed virtual and physical setting. \r\n  \r\nPrinciples from activity theory are examined, specifically with a focus on how people use artifacts and objects as mediators to collaborate in joint activity. As part of questioning the cases, we also position collaborative affordances in relation to the principles. We engage with the cases by using the theoretical principles both analytically and constructively.\r\n\r\nOur analysis specifically targets traces as a possible construct that has potential to constructively aid collaboration across the two cases. We explore what seems to be a lack of support, and in particular theoretical framing, of traces of past activities, connected objects, other users, etc. With an initial hypothesis that traces could be a mechanism that would support these two kinds of collaborative activities better in a future redesign, we set out to further explore the cases and their future possibilities, and how they could be conceptually grounded and supported. We present a set of analytically and constructively oriented questions to help researchers and designers of artifacts identify mediators for and instances of collaboration.",

      "abstract": "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults have been encouraged to stay indoors and isolated, leading to potential disruptions in their social activities and interpersonal relationships. This interview study (N=24) provides a close examination of older adults' technology adoption and communication practices in light of the pandemic. Our interviews revealed that the pandemic motivated many older adults to learn new technology and become more tech-savvy in an effort to stay connected with others. However, older adults also reported challenges related to the pandemic that were major impediments to technology adoption. These were: (1) lack of access to in-person technology support under physical distancing mandates, (2) lack of opportunities for online participation due to negative age stereotypes and assumptions, and (3) increased apprehension to seek help from family members and friends who were suffering from pandemic-related stresses. This study extends technology adoption literature and contributes an up-to-date examination of the \"grey digital divide\" (the gap between older adults who use technology and those who do not). Our findings demonstrate that despite the rapidly increasing number of tech-savvy seniors, a digital divide not only persists, but has been exacerbated by the transition to virtual-only offerings. We reveal the challenges and coping strategies of non-users and propose actionable solutions to increase digital access for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Collaboration across institutional boundaries is widespread and increasing today.  It depends on federations sharing data that often have governance rules or external regulations restricting their use.  However, the handling of data governance rules (aka. data-use policies) remains manual, time-consuming and error-prone, limiting the rate at which collaborations can form and respond to challenges and opportunities, inhibiting citizen science and reducing data providers' trust in compliance.  Using an automated system to facilitate compliance handling reduces substantially the time needed for such non-mission work, thereby accelerating collaboration and improving productivity.  We present a framework, Dr.Aid, that helps individuals, organisations and federations comply with data rules, using automation to track which rules are applicable as data is passed between processes and as derived data is generated.  It encodes data-governance rules using a formal language and performs reasoning on multi-input-multi-output data-flow graphs in decentralised contexts.  We test its power and utility by working with users performing cyclone tracking and earthquake modelling to support mitigation and emergency response.  We query standard provenance traces to detach Dr.Aid from details of the tools and systems they are using, as these inevitably vary across members of a federation and through time.  We evaluate the model in three aspects by encoding real-life data-use policies from diverse fields, showing its capability for real-world usage and its advantage to traditional frameworks.  We argue that this approach will lead to more agile, more productive and more trustworthy collaborations and show that the approach can be adopted incrementally.  This, in-turn, will allow more appropriate data policies to emerge opening up new forms of collaboration.",

      "abstract": "Family caregivers of patients with chronic conditions often subject themselves to drastic life changes. The quality of life of the caregivers often decreases noticeably at the beginning of the caregiving trajectory, because they typically reorient their lives to focus on the patient's health status. As a result, previous studies viewed caregivers primarily as people who need help and focused on how technologies can support them. However, in our study, we found that caregivers are also capable of developing their own experiential knowledge and strategies, which have been invisible in previous caregiver studies. By conducting in-home interviews with fourteen family caregivers, we present the types of new knowledge and coping strategies family caregivers have developed from their lived experiences during everyday caregiving tasks. These include 1) establishing new mindsets, 2) developing mindful activities, 3) building relationship management strategies, and 4) sharing experiences with people in their own networks. Based on our findings, we call for an asset-based approach that will help researchers notice the capabilities of caregivers. This approach could enable researchers to be more reflexive in the incorporation of caregivers' devalued knowledge within their system designs.",

      "abstract": "Content moderation systems for social media have had numerous issues of bias, in terms of race, gender, and ability among many others. One proposal for addressing such issues in automated decision making is by designing for contestability, whereby users can shape and influence how decisions are made. In this study, we conduct a series of participatory design workshops with participants from communities that have experienced problems with social media content moderation in the past. Together with participants, we explore the idea of designing for contestability in content moderation and find that users' designs suggest three fruitful, practical avenues: adding representation, improving communication, and designing with compassion. We conclude with design recommendations drawn from participants' proposals, and reflect on the challenges that remain.",

      "abstract": "The need for advanced automation and artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, including text classification, has dramatically increased in the last decade, leaving us critically dependent on their performance and reliability. Yet, as we increasingly rely more on AI applications, their algorithms are becoming more nuanced, more complex, and less understandable precisely at a time we need to understand them better and trust them to perform as expected. Text classification in the medical and cybersecurity domains are good examples of this. Human experts lack the capacity to deal with the high volume and velocity of data that needs to be classified, and ML techniques are often unexplainable and lack the ability to capture the required context needed to make the right decision and take action. We propose a new abstract configuration of Human-Machine Learning (HML) that focuses on reciprocal learning, where the human and the AI are collaborating partners.\r\n\r\nWe employ design-science research (DSR) to learn and design an application of the HML configuration, which incorporates software to support combining human and artificial intelligences. We define the HML configuration by its conceptual components and their function. We then describe the development of a system called Fusion that supports human-machine reciprocal learning. Using two case studies of text classification from the cyber domain, we evaluate Fusion and the proposed HML approach, demonstrating benefits and challenges. Our results show a clear ability of domain experts to improve the ML classification performance over time, while both human and machine, collaboratively, develop their conceptualization, i.e., their knowledge of classification. We generalize our insights from the DSR process as actionable principles for researchers and designers of 'human in the learning loop' systems. We conclude the paper by discussing HML configurations and the challenge of capturing and representing knowledge gained jointly by human and machine, an area we feel has great potential.",

The New York Times (NYT), on the other hand, has continued to scale up its online discussion resources to reach large audiences.  Through interviews with the NYT moderation team, we present examples of how moderators manage the first ~24-hours of online discussion after a story breaks, while balancing concerns about reporting credibility.  We discuss how managing comments at the NYT is not merely a matter of content regulation, but can involve reporting from the \"community beat\" to recognize emerging topics and synthesize the multiple perspectives in a discussion to promote community.  We discuss how other news organizations, including those lacking moderation resources, might appropriate the strategies and decisions offered by the NYT.  Future research might investigate strategies to share and update moderation resources around articles and topics.",

Guardians, mostly parents, have had to help their children transition and adapt to this difficult learning context. Previous work on remote learning has explored guardian involvement in pre-planned and well-developed remote learning programs, such as established virtual schools. However, ERL lacks pre-planned procedures, policies, and resources. In this paper, we look at how teachers and guardians collaborated to manage the situation. We present an interview study of guardians and teachers of K-12 students in China and look at their collaboration during the COVID-19 ERL. We report how teachers and guardians collaborated to carry out techno-procedural, surveillance, and material work to make ERL possible for K-12 students. Lastly, we reflect on the challenges our participants faced and discuss design implications not only for remote learning during COVID-19 but also future emergency remote learning situations.",

In such tasks, some items require far more effort than others to annotate. Furthermore, the per-item annotation effort is not known until after each item is annotated since determining the number of labels required is an implicit part of the annotation task itself. On an image bounding-box task with crowdsourced annotators, we show that annotator accuracy and recall consistently drop as effort increases. We hypothesize reasons for this drop and investigate a set of approaches to counteract it. Firstly, we benchmark on this task a set of general best-practice methods for quality crowdsourcing. Notably, only one of these methods actually improves quality: the use of visible gold questions that provide periodic feedback to workers on their accuracy as they work. Given these promising results, we then investigate and evaluate variants of the visible gold approach, yielding further improvement. Final results show a 7% improvement in bounding-box accuracy over the baseline. We discuss the generality of the visible gold approach and promising directions for future research.",

To understand the impact that these attacks can have on the work of researchers, we perform a series of systematic interviews with researchers including academics, journalists, and activists, who have experienced targeted, Internet-facilitated harassment. We provide a framework for understanding they types of harassers that target researchers, the harassment that ensues, and the personal and professional impact on individuals and academic freedom. We then study preventative and remedial strategies available, and the institutions that prevent some of these strategies from being more effective. Finally, we discuss the ethical structures that could facilitate more equitable access to participating in research without serious personal suffering.",

      "abstract": "Investigative data journalist work with a variety of data sources to tell a story. Though prior work have indicated that there is a close relationship between journalists’ data work practices and that of data scientists. However, these relationships and data work practices are not empirically examined, and understanding them is crucial to inform design of tools that are used by different groups of people including data scientist’s and data journalist’s. Thus, to bridge this gap, we studied investigative reporters’ data work practices with one non-profit investigative newsroom. Our study design includes two activities: 1) semi-structured interviews with journalists, and 2) a sketching activity allowing journalists to depict examples of their work practices. By analyzing these data and synthesizing across related prior work, we propose the major phases in datadriven investigative journalism story idea generation process. Our study findings show that the journalists employ a collection of multiple, iterative, cyclic processes to identify journalistically “interesting” story ideas.These processes both significantly resemble and show subtle nuanced differences with data science work practices identified in prior research. We further verified our proposal through a member check with key informants. This work offers three primary contributions. First, it provides a close glimpse into the main phases of investigative journalists’ data-driven story idea generation technique. Second, it complements prior work studying formal data science practices by examining data-driven investigative journalists, whose primary expertise lies outside computing. Third, it identifies particular points in the data exploration processes that would benefit from design interventions and suggests future research directions.",

      "abstract": "During crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, people spontaneously initiate support groups, while established organizations like soccer clubs set non-regular goals, both offering help. Interested in the coordination of such help and potential challenges of collaboration, we conducted a virtual ethnography of a multi-level network located in Germany. We focused on aims, activities, and technological mediation, with Activity Theory as theoretical framework. Our findings show that the organizational aim of coordinating help was successfully achieved by connecting heterogeneous actors through digitization and institutionalization. Enabled by the context of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, the network acted virtually, but was also able to integrate analog spaces of help. We identified six crucial implications regarding the use of technology and collaboration for building a successful volunteering network.",

As schools and other educational programs moved online, parents became the primary facilitators for their children’s learning. In this work, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 parents from nondominant groups. Insights from interviews highlight the technology-based learning experiences of young children during the pandemic, how parents facilitated these learning experiences, and the challenges parents and children encountered in these learning experiences. We summarize four parental facilitation patterns for children’s learning (i.e., designing learning, finding resources, managing, and teaching) and highlight equity issues in distance learning, such as unequal access to learning resources and quality education. Finally, we further reflect on potential solutions to address the challenges parents have reported and share implications for designing technologies that better address children’s and parents' needs during a crisis.

      "abstract": "How do people come to believe conspiracy theories, and what role does the internet play in this process as a socio-technical system? We explore these questions by examining online participants in the \"chemtrails\" conspiracy, the idea that visible condensation trails behind airliners are deliberately sprayed for nefarious purposes. We apply Weick's theory of sensemaking to examine the role of people's frames (beliefs and worldviews), as well as the socio-technical contexts (social interactions and technological affordances) for processing informational cues about the conspiracy. Through an analysis of in-depth interviews with thirteen believers and seven ex-believers, we find that many people become curious about chemtrails after consuming rich online media, and they later find welcoming online communities to support shared beliefs and worldviews. We discuss how the socio-technical context of the internet may inadvertently trap people in a perpetual state of ambiguity that becomes reinforced through a collective sensemaking process. In addition, we show how the conspiracy offers a way for believers to express their dissatisfaction with authority, enjoy a sense of community, and find some entertainment along the way. Finally, we discuss how people's frames and the various socio-technical contexts of the internet are important in the sensemaking of debunking evidence, and how such factors may function in the rejection of conspiratorial beliefs.",

      "abstract": "People often strive to present themselves authentically on social media, but this may not be possible for everyone. To understand how people view online authenticity, how it relates to social media sharing behaviors, and whether it is achievable, we interviewed 28 social media users who had recently experienced major life transitions. We found that to many participants, online authenticity required presenting a consistent, positive, and \"true\" self across online and offline contexts. Though most stated that they considered online authenticity achievable, their social media self-disclosure behaviors around life transitions revealed what we call the online authenticity paradox: people strive to achieve online authenticity, yet because doing so requires sharing negative experiences on social media, online authenticity is often unreachable, or is possible only at great personal cost - especially for those with marginalized identities and difficult life experiences.

      "abstract": "Authenticity, generally regarded as coherence between one’s inner self and outward behavior, is associated with myriad social values (e.g., integrity) and beneficial outcomes, such as psychological well-being. Scholarship suggests, however, that behaving authentically online is complicated by self-presentation norms that make it difficult to present a complex self as well as encourage sharing positive emotions and facets of self and discourage sharing difficult emotions. In this paper, we position authenticity as a self-presentation norm and identify the sociomaterial factors that contribute to the learning, enactment, and enforcement of authenticity on the short-video sharing platform TikTok. We draw on interviews with 15 U.S. TikTok users to argue that normative authenticity and understanding of TikTok as a “fun” platform are mutually constitutive in supporting a “just be you” attitude on TikTok that in turn normalizes expressions of both positive and difficult emotions and experiences. We consider the social context of TikTok and use an affordance lens to identify anonymity, of oneself and one’s audience; association between content and the “For You” landing page; and video modality of TikTok as factors informing authenticity as a self-presentation norm. We argue that these factors similarly contribute to TikTok’s viability as a space for social support exchange, and address the utility of the comments section as a site for both supportive communication and norm judgment and enforcement. We conclude by considering the limitations of authenticity as social norm and present implications for designing online spaces for social support and connection. ",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D reconstruction technology allow people to capture and share their experiences in 3D. However, little is known about people’s sharing preferences and privacy concerns for these reconstructed experiences. To fill this gap, we first present ReliveReality, an experience-sharing method utilizing deep learning-based computer vision techniques to reconstruct clothed humans and 3D environments and estimate 3D pose with only a RGB camera. ReliveReality can be integrated into social virtual environments, allowing others to socially relive a shared experience by moving around the experience from different perspectives, on desktop or in VR. We conducted a 44-participant within-subject study to compare ReliveReality to viewing recorded videos, and to a ReliveReality version with blurring obfuscation. Our results shed light on how people identify with reconstructed avatars, how obfuscation affects reliving experiences and sharing preferences and privacy concerns for reconstructed experiences. We propose design implications for addressing these issues.",

      "abstract": "Video chat continues to play an increasing role in the personal and professional lives of many people. When meeting someone for the first time via video chat, traditional icebreakers such as discussion questions may be used to ease conversation and facilitate disclosure; however, icebreaker questions have been shown to be less effective at facilitating relationships for some people than others. In this paper, we propose synchronously sharing online media as a more flexible, robust, and effective method of facilitating initial interactions in video chat. Our comparative study of icebreaker questions and media sharing reveals that shared media supports a different style of conversation than icebreakers, but results in equal levels of self-disclosure and trust along with higher levels of warranting and relatedness. Further, while the effectiveness of icebreakers in building trust is lower for individuals low in agreeableness, media sharing results in similar trust formation at all levels of agreeableness. Synchronous media sharing is a promising way of leveraging the digital context of video chat to better support early stages of relationships.",

      "abstract": "In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, online risk detection has become a popular research topic. From detecting online harassment to the sexual predation of youth, the state-of-the-art in computational risk detection has the potential to protect particularly vulnerable populations from online victimization. Yet, this is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor that requires a systematic and human-centered approach to synthesize disparate bodies of research across different application domains, so that we can identify best practices, potential gaps, and set a strategic research agenda for leveraging these approaches in a way that betters society. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to analyze 73 peer-reviewed articles on computational approaches utilizing text or meta-data/multimedia for online sexual risk detection. We identified sexual grooming (75%), sex trafficking (12%), and sexual harassment and/or abuse (12%) as the three types of sexual risk detection present in the extant literature. Furthermore, we found that the majority (93%) of this work has focused on identifying sexual predators after-the-fact, rather than taking more nuanced approaches to identify potential victims and problematic patterns that could be used to prevent victimization before it occurs. Many studies rely on public datasets (82%) and third-party annotators (33%) to establish ground truth and train their algorithms.\r\nFinally, the majority of this work (78%) mostly focused on algorithmic performance evaluation of their model and rarely (4%) evaluate these systems with real users. Thus, we urge computational risk detection researchers to integrate more human-centered approaches to both developing and evaluating sexual risk detection algorithms to ensure the broader societal impacts of this important work.

      "abstract": "Effective teamwork is critical to improve patient outcomes in healthcare. However, achieving this capability requires that pre-service nurses develop the spatial abilities they will require in their clinical placements, such as: learning when to remain close to the patient and to other team members; positioning themselves correctly at the right time; and deciding on specific team formations (e.g. face-to-face or side-by-side) to enable effective interaction or avoid disrupting clinical procedures. However, positioning dynamics are ephemeral and can easily become occluded by the multiple tasks nurses have to accomplish. Digital traces automatically captured by indoor positioning sensors can be used to address this problem for the purpose of improving nurses’ reflection, learning and professional development. This paper presents a modelling approach that transforms nurses’ low-level position traces to higher-order proxemics constructs in simulation-based teamwork training.To illustrate our approach, we conducted an in-the-wild study with 55 undergraduate students and five educators from whom positioning traces were captured in eleven authentic nursing education classes. Low-level x-y data was used in models of three proxemics constructs: i) co-presence in interactional spaces, ii)socio-spatial formations (i.e. f-formations), and ii) presence in spaces of interest. Through a number of vignettes, we illustrate how indoor positioning analytics can be used to address questions that educators and researchers have about teamwork in healthcare simulation settings.",

      "abstract": "Pull Requests (PRs) are a frequently used method for proposing changes to source code repositories. When discussing proposed changes in a PR discussion, stakeholders often reference a wide variety of information objects for establishing shared awareness and common ground. Previous work has not considered how the referential behavior impacts collaborative software development via PRs. This knowledge gap is the major barrier in evaluating the current support for referencing in PRs and improving them. We conducted an explorative analysis of \\textasciitilde7K references, collected from 450 public PRs on GitHub, and constructed taxonomies of referent types and expressions. Using our annotated dataset, we identified several patterns in the use of references. Referencing source code elements was prevalent but the authoring interface lacks support for it. Three classes of contextual factors influence referencing behaviors: referent type, discussion thread, and project attributes. Referencing patterns may indicate PR outcomes (e.g., merged PRs frequently reference issues, users, and tests). We conclude with design implications to support more effective referencing in PR discussion interfaces.",

      "abstract": "Voice assistants offer users access to an increasing variety of personalized functionalities. The researchers and engineers who build these experiences rely on various signals from users to create the machine learning models powering them. One type of signal is explicit in situ feedback. While collecting explicit in situ user feedback via voice assistants would help improve and inspect the underlying models, from a user perspective it can be disruptive to the overall experience, and the user might not feel compelled to respond. However, careful design can help alleviate friction in the experience. In this paper, we explore the opportunities and the design space for voice assistant feedback elicitation. First, we present four usage categories of explicit in-situ context for model evaluation and improvement, derived from interviews with machine learning practitioners. Then, using realistic scenarios generated for each category and based on examples from the interviews, we conducted an online study to evaluate multiple voice assistant designs. Our results reveal that when the voice assistant is framed as a learner or a collaborator, users were more willing to respond to its request for feedback and felt that the experience was less disruptive. In addition, giving users instructions on how to initiate feedback themselves can reduce the perceived disruptiveness to the experience compared to asking users for feedback directly in the form of a question. Based on our findings, we discuss the implications and potential future directions for designing voice assistants to elicit user feedback for personalized voice experiences.",

      "abstract": "CSCW has previously investigated the “information work” that patients do in relation to their health, illnesses, and treatments. Our study contributes to this ongoing stream of work by investigating the information work that chronically ill patients do in relation to their physical bodily experiences. We use an interpretivist approach and qualitative methods (semi-structured interviews and observations) to examine how patients in a midwestern U.S. city carry out information work related to their bodily experiences of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Our findings highlight four themes related to such work: bodily experiences of CKD; making meaning of bodily experiences through experiential learning; communicating bodily experiences; and attuning daily life around bodily experiences. In so doing, we show how patients continuously engage in information work in relation to their bodily experiences. For example, we found participants experienced physical sensations such as pain, cramping, and extreme fatigue, which elicited complex labor, yet most patients received little education from health care professionals about what bodily sensations they might have and what these physical experiences might mean. While patients and clinicians worked collaboratively to adjust treatment based on bodily information, such collaborative adjustment often did not occur until patients learned to interpret and communicate bodily experiences through a difficult and physically painful “trial and error” learning process. Our empirical insights extend on the literature of information work that chronically ill patients do and inform design of information technologies and care processes for patients with chronic disease. \r\n",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the potential of distributed emulation networks to support research and pedagogy into historical and sociotechnical aspects of software. Emulation is a type of virtualization that re-creates the conditions for a piece of legacy software to operate on a modern system. The paper first offers a review of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Science and Technology Studies (STS) literature engaging with software as historical and sociotechnical artifacts, and with emulation as a vehicle of scholarly inquiry. It then documents the novel use of software emulations as a pedagogical resource and research tool for legacy software systems analysis. This is accomplished through the integration of the Emulation as a Service Infrastructure (EaaSI) distributed emulation network into a university-level course focusing on computer-aided design (CAD). The paper offers a detailed case study of a pedagogical experience oriented to incorporate emulations into software research and learning. It shows how emulations allow for close, user-centered analyses of software systems that highlight both their historical evolution and core interaction concepts, and how they shape the work practices of their users.",

      "abstract": "Governments are increasingly turning to algorithmic risk assessments when making important decisions (such as whether to release criminal defendants before trial). Policymakers assert that providing public servants with algorithms will improve human risk predictions and thereby lead to better (e.g., fairer) decisions. Yet because many policy decisions require balancing risk-reduction with competing goals, improving the accuracy of predictions may not necessarily improve the quality of decisions. Through an experiment with 2,140 lay participants simulating two high-stakes government contexts, we interrogate the assumption that improving human prediction accuracy with risk assessments will improve human decisions. We provide the first direct evidence that risk assessments can systematically alter how people factor risk into their decisions. These shifts counteract the potential benefits of improved prediction accuracy. In the pretrial setting of our experiment, the risk assessment made participants more sensitive to increases in perceived risk when making decisions; this shift increased the racial disparity in pretrial detention by 1.9%. In the government home improvement loans setting of our experiment, the risk assessment made participants more risk-averse when making decisions; this shift reduced government aid by 8.3%. These results demonstrate the potential limits and harms of efforts to improve public policy by incorporating predictive algorithms into multifaceted policy decisions. If these observed behaviors occurred in practice, presenting algorithms to public servants would generate unexpected and unjust shifts in public policy without being subject to democratic deliberation or oversight.",

      "abstract": "Videoconference has become the dominant technology for remote meetings.  Embodied Virtual Reality is a potential alternative that employs motion tracking in order to place people in a shared virtual environment as avatars.  This paper describes a 210 participant study focused on behavioral measures that compares multiparty interaction in videoconference and embodied VR across a range of task types: a factual intellective task, a subjective judgment task and two negotiation tasks, one with visual grounding.  It uses state-of-the-art body, face and finger tracking to drive the avatars in VR and a carefully matched videoconferencing implementation.  Significant behavioral differences are observed. These include increased activity in videoconference related to maintaining the social connection: more person directed gaze and increased verbal and nonverbal backchannel behavior. Videoconference also had reduced conversational overlap, increased self-adaptor gestures and reduced deictic gestures as compared with embodied VR.  Potential explanations and implications are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Human ratings have become a crucial resource for training and evaluating machine learning systems. However, traditional elicitation methods for absolute and comparative rating  suffer from issues with consistency and often do not distinguish between uncertainty due to disagreement between annotators and ambiguity inherent to the item being rated. In this work, we present Goldilocks, a novel crowd rating elicitation technique for collecting calibrated scalar annotations that also distinguishes inherent ambiguity from inter-annotator disagreement. We introduce two main ideas: grounding absolute rating scales with examples and using a two-step bounding process to establish a range for an item's placement}. We test our designs in three domains: judging toxicity of online comments, estimating satiety of food depicted in images, and estimating age based on portraits. We show that (1) Goldilocks can improve consistency in domains where interpretation of the scale is not universal, and that (2) representing items with ranges lets us simultaneously capture different sources of uncertainty leading to better estimates of pairwise relationship distributions.",

      "abstract": "With voice user interfaces (VUIs) becoming ubiquitous and speech synthesis technology maturing, it is possible to synthesise voices to resemble our friends and relatives (which we will collectively call `kin') and use them on VUIs. However, designing such interfaces and investigating how the familiarity of kin voices affect user perceptions remain under-explored. Our surveys and interviews with 25 users revealed that VUIs using kin voices were perceived as more engaging, persuasive and safer yet eerier than VUIs using common virtual assistant voices. We then developed a technology probe, KinVoice, an Alexa-based VUI which was deployed in 3 households over 2 weeks. Users set reminders using KinVoice, which in turn, gave the reminders in synthesised kin voices. This was to explore users’ needs, uncover challenges involved and inspire new applications. We discuss design guidelines for integrating familiar kin voices into VUIs, applications that benefit from its usage, and implications for balancing voice realism and usability with security and diversification.",

      "abstract": "In our society, where technologies continue to act as a marginalizing force for various individuals and communities, makerspaces present unique opportunities for community-driven work that engages people with a variety of communal technologies, knowledge, and work practices. However, makerspaces grew out of largely exclusionary discourses, which continue to neglect non-dominant technology practices, knowledge bases, and communities. Despite these origins, research remains largely optimistic about the potential for makerspaces to provide equitable opportunities for those stereotypically excluded to engage, learn, and build with technologies. We mirror this optimism through our work examining how makerspaces might be positioned to address social inequities while supporting community growth and development. This paper traces the development of a social justice makerspace situated within a community of color in the United States. The work contributes a contextual analysis of the design of a makerspace explicitly positioned to forefront community voices and address issues of social inequities. We highlight community perspectives within our situated design process as we draw out the themes and tensions that arose. Applying a social justice framework from Dombrowski et al. (2016) and LÃ¶tterâ€™s (2011) to our findings we demonstrate how makerspaces can be positioned to address social inequities through: identifying, educating, and communicating about inequities; engaging in the distribution of resources and opportunities; and enabling capacity building at the individual and structural levels. We highlight how an asset-based orientation can position the makerspace to grow in effective ways to address community issues.",

      "abstract": "Code review is an important quality assurance activity for software development. Code review discussions among developers and maintainers can be heated and sometimes involve personal attacks and unnecessary disrespectful comments, demonstrating, therefore, incivility. Although incivility in public discussions has received increasing attention from researchers in different domains, the knowledge about the characteristics, causes, and consequences of uncivil communication is still very limited in the context of software development, and more specifically, code review. To address this gap in the literature, we leverage the mature social construct of incivility as a lens to understand confrontational conflicts in open source code review discussions. For that, we conducted a qualitative analysis on 1,545 emails from the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML) that were associated with rejected changes. We found that more than half (66.66%) of the non-technical emails included uncivil features. Particularly, frustration, name calling, and impatience are the most frequent features in uncivil emails. We also found that there are civil alternatives to address arguments, while uncivil comments can potentially be made by any people when discussing any topic. Finally, we identified various causes and consequences of such uncivil communication. Our work serves as the first study about the phenomenon of in(civility) in open source software development, paving the road for a new field of research about collaboration and communication in the context of software engineering activities.",

      "abstract": "Political organizations worldwide keep innovating their use of social media technologies. This study describes a novel configuration of technologies and organizational forms for the manipulation of Twitter trends. In the 2019 Indian general election, campaign organizers used a network of WhatsApp groups to coordinate mass-postings by loosely affiliated supporters. To investigate the campaigns, we joined more than 600 political WhatsApp groups that support the Bharatiya Janata Party, the right-wing party that won the general election. We found direct evidence of 75 hashtag manipulation campaigns, including mobilization messages and lists of pre-written tweets. We estimate the campaigns' size and whether they succeeded in creating controlled narratives on social media. The findings show that the campaigns are smaller than what other reports suggested; however, the strategy reliably produced Twitter trends through the voices of loosely affiliated supporters. Centrally controlled but voluntary in participation, this novel configuration of a  campaign complicates the debates over the legitimate use of digital tools for political participation. It may have provided a blueprint for participatory media manipulation by a party with popular support.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, researchers have sought more effective ways of making data “open,” for purposes of accountability, engagement, and reuse. Often, such efforts focus on making existing data sets available to broad audiences. The expression data set itself suggests something discrete, complete, and easily transferable. But data are none of those things. In this paper, we argue that open data projects could benefit from a more contextual understanding of what open means. Instead of focusing on open data sets, researchers can seek to create and understand open data settings: contexts in which things of public significance can be presented as evidence. We share our experiences creating and analyzing open data settings for the Map Room Project, a research through design initiative to establish local spaces for collaborative data exploration and mapping. Our contribution is to offer a conceptual framework through which researchers, as well as designers, might think about the openness of data settings. This framework comes out of a situational analysis of comparative empirical case studies. In data settings, we find that open can mean accessible, inclusive, or indeterminate. Practices of contextualization, such as configuring, convening, and claim-making, shape these dimensions of openness by defining all of the following: where data can work, who is empowered to use them, and what can count as data.",

However, the real-world challenges of conducting multidisciplinary co-design research to inform the design of self-care technologies are not well established. We provide a qualitative account of a multidisciplinary project that aimed to co-design machine learning applications for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) self-management. Through retrospective interviews, we identify not only perceived social, technological and strategic benefits of co-design but also organisational, translational and pragmatic design challenges: participants with T1D experienced difficulties in co-designing systems that met their individual self-care needs as part of group design activities; HCI and AI researchers described challenges collaborating to apply co-design outcomes to data-driven ML work; and industry collaborators highlighted academic data sharing regulations as cross-organisational challenges that can impede co-design efforts. Based on this understanding, we discuss opportunities for supporting multidisciplinary collaborations and aligning individual health needs with collaborative co-design activities.",

      "abstract": "Automatic emotion recognition (ER)-enabled wellbeing interventions use ER algorithms to infer the emotions of a data subject (i.e., a person about whom data is collected or processed to enable ER) based on data generated from their online interactions, such as social media activity, and intervene accordingly. The potential commercial applications of this technology are widely acknowledged, particularly in the context of social media. Yet, little is known about data subjects' conceptualizations of and attitudes toward automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions. To address this gap, we interviewed 13 US adult social media data subjects regarding social media-based automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions. We found that participants' attitudes toward automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions were predominantly negative. Negative attitudes were largely shaped by how participants compared their conceptualizations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the humans that traditionally deliver wellbeing support. Comparisons between AI and human wellbeing interventions were based upon human attributes participants doubted AI could hold: 1) helpfulness and authentic care; 2) personal and professional expertise; 3) morality; and 4) benevolence through shared humanity. In some cases, participants' attitudes toward automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions shifted when participants conceptualized automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions' impact on others, rather than themselves. Though with reluctance, a minority of participants held more positive attitudes toward their conceptualizations of automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions, citing their potential to benefit others: 1) by supporting academic research; 2) by increasing access to wellbeing support; and 3) through egregious harm prevention. However, most participants anticipated harms associated with their conceptualizations of automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions for others, such as re-traumatization, the spread of inaccurate health information, inappropriate surveillance, and interventions informed by inaccurate predictions. Lastly, while participants had qualms about automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions, we identified three development and delivery qualities of automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions upon which their attitudes toward them depended: 1) accuracy; 2) contextual sensitivity; and 3) positive outcome. Our study is not motivated to make normative statements about whether or how automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions should exist, but to center voices of the data subjects affected by this technology. We argue for the inclusion of data subjects in the development of requirements for ethical and trustworthy ER applications. To that end, we discuss ethical, social, and policy implications of our findings, suggesting that automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions imagined by participants are incompatible with aims to promote trustworthy, socially aware, and responsible AI technologies in the current practical and regulatory landscape in the US.",

This paper aims to investigate how families of different socioeconomic status use or forgo the use of smart devices, specifically smart speakers and smart interactive toys. To this end, we interviewed 14 parents with low socioeconomic status and 16 parents with high socioeconomic status from varied races and different levels of education, lifestyles,  and occupations. Our findings reveal  how socioeconomic differences reflect and impact use of these devices in terms of parenting aids, parents' regulation of  children's use, and the non-use practices of families. In the end, we discuss the implications of our findings and provide design recommendations for smart speakers and smart toys that address the diverse values and preferences of families from different socioeconomic backgrounds.",

This case study investigates a group of collectively managed WiFi Internet networks in Argentina and the technologists who design the networking hardware and software. Members of these community networks collaborate on maintenance and repair and practice new forms of collective work. Drawing on Actor-Network Theory, we show that the networking technologies play a role in the social relations of their maintenance and that they are intentionally configured to do so. For technology designers and deployers, we suggest a path beyond designing for easy repair: since every breakdown is an opportunity to learn, we should design for accessible repair experiences that enable effective collaborative learning.",

      "abstract": "The field of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has long recognized a socio-technical gap complicating the design of technologies that can sustainably meet social needs. In response, a growing body of research advocates for assets-based design, an approach that seeks to build upon what the individuals and community already have.  The emphasis on positioning assets rather than needs at the center of the process can complicate designers’ decisions on what activities to foster, how to conduct them, and what outcomes to expect. In this paper, we reflect on two different assets-based design endeavors with vulnerable populations. Our reflections present assets-based design as an ongoing process that prioritizes the formation and evolution of a collective of assets-based thinkers who continually learn about their assets and how to use them to attain desirable change. From that reflection, we contribute three methodological commitments for assets-based design to the growing CSCW scholarship on supporting vulnerable communities to attain emancipatory transformations: (1) embedding trust-building elements throughout the journey;(2) facilitating the formation of an interdependent collective; and (3) making moves towards incremental transformations. Further, we contribute a discussion on the change of perspective that entails for researchers and designers interested in undertaking assets-based design. In particular, we underscore the need to recognize the value of work before the work, to see technology as an intermediary rather than an inevitable end, and embrace impact in the shape of slow incremental transformation.",

      "abstract": "The increased importance of opaque, algorithmically-driven social platforms (e.g., Facebook, YouTube) to everyday users as a medium for self-presentation effectively requires users to speculate on how platforms work in order to decide how to behave to achieve their self-presentation goals. This speculation takes the form of folk theorization. Because platforms constantly change, users must constantly re-evaluate their folk theories. Based on an Asynchronous Remote Community study of LGBTQ+ social platform users with heightened self-presentation concerns, I present an updated model of the folk theorization process to account for platform change. Moreover, I find that both the complexity of the user’s folk theorization and their overall relationship with the platform impact this theorization process, and present new concepts for examining and classifying these elements: theorization complexity level and perceived platform spirit. I conclude by proposing a folk theorization-based path towards an extensible algorithmic literacy which would support users in ongoing theorization.",

First, studying processes of negotiating the repairedness of an artifact accounts for contingency in the properties of the artifact itself, which differs from contingencies in collaborative work practices that have been a focus of CSCW research on repair. Second, a concept of repairedness highlights how ongoing processes of interacting with an artifact nonetheless need to be brought to contingent conclusions, suggesting that an artifact’s properties are a valuable site for sustainable engagement. These contributions help CSCW research on repair account for the multiplicity of artifacts highlighted by STS scholars as integral to how humans sustainably engage with artifacts in their practices.",

      "abstract": "Street outreach is a violence prevention model in which organizations hire residents with strong relationships and local expertise to mediate violent conflicts in their communities. We present the results of a two-year co-design engagement with a street outreach organization in which we collaboratively designed, built, and deployed a mobile application (the Street Peace app) to support street outreach workers (SOWs) in the field and in building community. Three different street outreach organizations in Chicago adopted the app for two months. Results suggest that the app supported SOWs' work of building a counter-structure to traditional policing, which is historically oppressive to Black and Brown communities, and practice transformative justice. The SOWs used the app to mediate potentially violent conflicts without police involvement, build community through in-person events, and extend their communities of care through positive stories and narratives that countered harmful stereotypes about Black criminality. By affording SOWs more agency over their communication with each other, the VP app enabled SOWs to connect their strengths and scale their existing counter-structural practices.  ",

      "abstract": "Since smart speakers were introduced to the Indian markets at the end of 2017, they have been adopted by hundreds of thousands households in India. While the scholarship has examined the long-term use of voice-based devices in western contexts, little is known about user behavior in India -- one of the fastest-growing smart speaker markets in the Asian Pacific region. Therefore, this study aims to explore how members families in India integrate Google Home into their daily lives. To this end, we collected long-term Google Home activity logs from 20 households and conducted interviews with one member from each generation in every household. Our findings shed light on the unique daily use patterns of adults and children, the users' approaches to, and challenges in learning to use, the devices, and factors that impact users' continued use or abandonment of the devices. We conclude the paper by discussing the implications of our findings and by proposing relevant design recommendations.",

However, the public still sees software development as a profession for ``math wizards''. \r\n \r\n To learn more about this special type of knowledge worker from their first-person perspective, we conducted three studies to learn how developers describe a day in their life through vlogs on YouTube and how these vlogs were received by the broader community.\r\n \r\n We first interviewed 16 developers who vlogged to identify their motivations for creating this content and their intention behind what they chose to portray. Second, we analyzed 130 vlogs (video blogs) to understand the range of the content conveyed through videos. Third, we analyzed 1176 comments from the 130 vlogs to understand the impact the vlogs have on the audience. \r\n \r\n We found that developers were motivated to promote and build a diverse community, by sharing different aspects of life that define their identity, and by creating awareness about learning and career opportunities in computing.\r\n \r\n They used vlogs to share a variety of how software developers work and live---showcasing often unseen experiences, including intimate moments from their personal life.\r\n \r\n From our comment analysis, we found that the vlogs were valuable to the audience to find information and seek advice. Commenters sought opportunities to connect with others over shared triumphs and trials they faced that were also shown in the vlogs. \r\n \r\n As a central theme, we found that developers use vlogs to challenge the misconceptions and stereotypes around their identity, work-life, and well-being. These social stigmas are obstacles to an inclusive and accepting community and can deter people from choosing software development as a career. \r\n \r\n We also discuss the implications of using vlogs to support developers, researchers, and beyond.\"",

      "abstract": "As news organizations embrace transparency practices on their websites to distinguish themselves from those spreading misinformation, HCI designers have the opportunity to help them effectively utilize the ideals of transparency to build trust. How can we utilize transparency to promote trust in news? We examine this question through a qualitative lens by interviewing journalists and news consumers---the two stakeholders in a news system. We designed a scenario to demonstrate transparency features using two fundamental news attributes that convey the trustworthiness of a news article: source and message. In the interviews, our news consumers expressed the idea that news transparency could be best shown by providing indicators of objectivity in two areas (news selection and framing) and by providing indicators of evidence in four areas (presence of source materials, anonymous sourcing, verification, and corrections upon erroneous reporting). While our journalists agreed with news consumers' suggestions of using evidence indicators, they also suggested additional transparency indicators in areas such as the news reporting process and personal/organizational conflicts of interest. Prompted by our scenario, participants offered new design considerations for building trustworthy news platforms, such as designing for easy comprehension, presenting appropriate details in news articles (e.g., showing the number and nature of corrections made to an article), and comparing attributes across news organizations to highlight diverging practices. Comparing the responses from our two stakeholder groups reveals conflicting suggestions with trade-offs between them. Our study has implications for HCI designers in building trustworthy news systems.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the transition of workflows across sectors to digital platforms. In educational contexts, teachers and schools previously reluctant to integrate computing technology in the classroom now find themselves with little choice but to embrace it. This move to the digital brings additional challenges in underserved contexts with limited, intermittent, and shared access to mobile or computing devices and the internet. In this rapidly evolving digital landscape, we investigate how educational institutions (schools and non-profit organizations) working with underserved populations in India are managing the transition to online or remote learning. We conducted twenty remote interviews with students, teachers, and administrators from underserved contexts across India. We found that online learning efforts in this setting relied on a resilient human infrastructure comprised of students, teachers, parents, administrators, and non-profit organizations, to help navigate and overcome the  limitations of available technical infrastructure. Our research aims to articulate lessons for educational technology design in the post-COVID period, outlining areas for the improvement in the design of online learning platforms in resource-constrained settings, and identifying elements of online learning that could be retained to strengthen the education system overall.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of smart devices and high-quality wireless technologies, mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) has been drawing increasing attention with its great potential in collaboratively completing complicated tasks on a large scale. A key issue toward successful MCS is participant recruitment, where a MCS platform directly recruits suitable crowd participants to execute outsourced tasks by physically traveling to specified locations. Recently, a novel recruitment strategy, namely Word-of-Mouth(WoM)-based MCS, has emerged to effectively improve recruitment effectiveness, by fully exploring users' mobility traces and social relationships on geo-social networks. Against this background, we study in this paper a novel problem, namely Expected Task Execution Quality Maximization (ETEQM) for MCS in geo-social networks, which strives to search a subset of seed users to maximize the expected task execution quality of all recruited participants, under a given incentive budget. To characterize the MCS task propagation process over geo-social networks, we first adopt a propagation tree structure to model the autonomous recruitment between the referrers and the referrals. Based on the model, we then formalize the task execution quality and devise a novel incentive mechanism by harnessing the business strategy of multi-level marketing. We formulate our ETEQM problem as a combinatorial optimization problem, and analyze its NP hardness and high-dimensional characteristics. Based on a cooperative co-evolution framework, we proposed a divide-and-conquer problem-solving approach named ETEQM-CC. We conduct extensive simulation experiments and a case study, verifying the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Software bots are used to streamline tasks in Open Source Software (OSS) projects' pull requests, saving development cost, time, and effort. However, their presence can be disruptive to the community. We identified several challenges caused by bots in pull request interactions by interviewing 21 practitioners, including project maintainers, contributors, and bot developers. In particular, our findings indicate noise as a recurrent and central problem. Noise affects both human communication and development workflow by overwhelming and distracting developers. Our main contribution is a theory of how human developers perceive annoying bot behaviors as noise on social coding platforms. This contribution may help practitioners understand the effects of adopting a bot, and researchers and tool designers may leverage our results to better support human-bot interaction on social coding platforms.\r\n",

      "abstract": "This paper qualitatively examines how members of a large private Facebook group view the risks of information disclosure to their privacy and the strategies they employ to navigate and manage those risks. The paper adds to an emerging interest in how privacy is managed collectively and within dynamic large groups, thus moving beyond established knowledge of privacy management on individual and small-scale levels. The work builds on semi-structured interviews with 20 members of a private Facebook group and draws on Communication Privacy Management theory. The study shows how privacy management practices are enacted at individual, intragroup, and group levels. Findings show that participants associate very high risks with sharing private information in the group, partly because it consists of a mix of known others and strangers, who are potentially geographically co-located. They adopt several strategies for managing and protecting their privacy at all three levels. The risks associated with context, time, and spatial collapse of the imagined audience are identified as important to how participants experience information disclosure in the group. The paper concludes by identifying some practical implications that serve as a call for developers to design privacy tools that support dynamic groups’ privacy challenges and needs.",

      "abstract": "The ever increasing amount of data on people's smartphones often contains private information of others that people interact with via the device. As a result, one user's decisions regarding app permissions can expose the information of other users. However, research typically focuses on consequences of privacy-related decisions only for those who make the decisions. Work on the impact of these decisions on the privacy of others is still relatively scant. We fill this gap with an online study that extends prior work on interdependent privacy in social networking sites to the context of smartphone permissions. Our findings indicate that people typically give less consideration to the implications of their actions for the privacy of others, compared to the impact on themselves. However, we found that priming people with information that features others can help reduce this discrepancy. We apply this insight to offer suggestions for enhancing permission-specification interfaces and system architectures to accommodate interdependent privacy.",

      "abstract": "Many couples experience long-distance relationships (LDRs), and â€œcouple technologiesâ€ have been designed to influence certain relational practices or maintain them in challenging situations. Chatbots show great potential in mediating peopleâ€™s interactions. However, little is known about whether and how chatbots can be desirable and effective for mediating LDRs. In this paper, we conducted a two-phase study to design and evaluate a chatbot, PocketBot, that aims to provide effective interventions for LDRs. In Phase I, we adopted an iterative design process through conducting need-finding interviews to formulate design ideas and piloted the implemented PocketBot with 11 participants. In Phase II, we evaluated PocketBot with eighteen participants (nine LDR couples)} in a week-long field trial followed by exit interviews, which yielded empirical understandings of the feasibility, effectiveness, and potential pitfalls of using PocketBot. First, a knock-on-the-door feature allowed couples to know when to resume an interaction after evading a conflict; this feature was preferred by certain participants (e.g., participants with stoic personalities). Second, a humor feature was introduced to spice up couplesâ€™ conversations. This feature was favored by all participants, although some couplesâ€™ perceptions of the feature varied due to their different cultural or language backgrounds. Third, a deep talk feature enabled couples at different relational stages to conduct opportunistic conversations about sensitive topics for exploring unknowns about each other, which resulted in surprising discoveries between couples who have been in relationships for years. Our findings provide inspiration for future conversational-based couple technologies that support emotional communication.",

      "abstract": "AI systems can fail to learn important behaviors, leading to real-world issues like safety concerns and biases. Discovering these systematic failures often requires significant developer attention, from hypothesizing potential edge cases to collecting evidence and validating patterns. To scale and streamline this process, we introduce crowdsourced failure reports, end-user descriptions of how or why a model failed, and show how developers can use them to detect AI errors. We also design and implement Deblinder, a visual analytics system for synthesizing failure reports that developers can use to discover and validate systematic failures. In semi-structured interviews and think-aloud studies with 10 AI practitioners, we explore the affordances of the Deblinder system and the applicability of failure reports in real-world settings. Lastly, we show how collecting additional data from the groups identified by developers can improve model performance.",

      "abstract": "Creating truly original ideas requires extensive knowledge of existing ideas. Navigating prior examples can help people to understand what has already been done and to assess the quality of their own ideas through comparison. The creativity literature has suggested that the conceptual distance between a proposed solution and a potential inspiration can influence one's thinking. However, less is known about how creators might use data about conceptual distance when exploring a large repository of ideas. To investigate this, we created a novel tool for exploring examples called IdeateRelate that visualizes 600+ COVID-related ideas, organized by their similarity to a new idea. In an experiment that compared the IdeateRelate visualization to a simple list of examples, we found that users in the Viz condition leveraged both semantic and categorical similarity, curated a more similar set of examples, and adopted more language from examples into their iterated ideas (without negatively affecting the overall novelty). We discuss implications for creating adaptive interfaces that provide creative inspiration in response to designers' ideas throughout an iterative design process.",

      "abstract": "AI is becoming increasingly integrated in common technologies, which suggests that learning experiences for audiences seeking a “casual” understanding of AI—i.e. understanding how a search engine works, not necessarily understanding how to program one—is an increasingly important design space. Informal learning spaces like museums are particularly well-suited for such public science communication efforts, but there is little research investigating how to design AI learning experiences for these spaces. This paper explores how to design museum experiences that communicate key concepts about AI, using collaboration, creativity, and embodiment as inspirations for design. We present the design of five low-fidelity AI literacy exhibit prototypes and results from a thematic analysis of participant interactions during a co-design workshop in which family groups interacted with the prototypes and designed exhibits of their own. Our findings suggest new topics and design considerations for AI-related exhibits and directions for future research.",

We identified themes regarding their behaviors and perceptions when communicating with each other through an open coding approach. The analysis of the findings reveals that communication issues exist between SV and SVC. While SV faced challenges approaching SVC, SVC had experienced difficulties in finding the right SV to ask for assistance in the tasks. We also found that information provided by SVC were not sufficient for SV to perform the assigned tasks. Similarly, SVC had a similar the issue where they received limited information from former SVC. We present design implications that enable both SV and SVC to share their availability, preferences, and prior knowledge of about potential tasks with each other. This is the first study that reports design opportunities to support SV and SVC.",

      "abstract": "Crowdsourcing is being increasingly adopted as a platform to run studies with human subjects. Running a crowdsourcing experiment involves several choices and strategies to successfully port an experimental design into an otherwise uncontrolled research environment, e.g., sampling crowd workers, mapping experimental conditions to micro-tasks, or ensure quality contributions. While several guidelines inform researchers in these choices, guidance of how and what to report from crowdsourcing experiments has been largely overlooked. If under-reported, implementation choices constitute variability sources that can affect the experiment's reproducibility and prevent a fair assessment of research outcomes. In this paper, we examine the current state of reporting of crowdsourcing experiments and offer guidance to address associated reporting issues. We start by identifying sensible implementation choices, relying on existing literature and interviews with experts, to then extensively analyze the reporting of 171 crowdsourcing experiments. Informed by this process, we propose a checklist for reporting crowdsourcing experiments.",

      "abstract": "Although player performance in online games has been widely studied, few studies have considered the behavioral preferences of players and how that impacts performance. In a competitive setting where players must cooperate with temporary teammates, it is even more crucial to understand how differences in playing style contribute to teamwork. Drawing on theories of individual behavior in teams, we describe a methodology to empirically profile players based on the diversity and conformity of their gameplay styles. Applying this approach to a League of Legends dataset, we find three distinct types of players that align with our theoretical framework: generalists, specialists, and mavericks. Importantly, the behavior of each player type remains stable despite players becoming more experienced. Additionally, we extensively investigate the benefits and drawbacks of each type of player by evaluating their individual performance, contribution to the team, and adaptation to changes in the game environment. We find that, overall, specialists tend to outperform others, while mavericks bear high risk but also potentially reap great rewards. Generalists are the most resilient to instability in the environment (game patches). We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of game design and community management, as well as team building in environments with varying levels of stability. ",

      "abstract": "While studies have shown that graduates from elite universities enjoy high employment rates, they do not tell the story of how students from different social class backgrounds experience the hiring process. We address this question by interviewing upper-middle-class (UMC) and working- and middle-class (WMC) Computer Science Ph.D. students at prestigious universities who are applying for lucrative internships at established technology companies. We find that while these students are aware of and have access to the â€œsameâ€ resources (e.g., social connections and insider knowledge about employersâ€™ expectations), the tactics they use to act on these resources and their emotional experience of the hiring process vary along social class lines. In short, the class-based norms of UMC applicants align with those of employers. The majority of WMC applicants, however, discuss experiencing tension between their class-based norms and employersâ€™ dominant values. In contrast to their UMC counterparts, these applicants report spending substantial amounts of time preparing for the hiring process and describe the hiring process as emotionally draining. This research provides insight into the emotional burdens facing even the most privileged WMC applicants. Our findings also have implications for how organizations should take into account social class backgrounds in their hiring practices.",

      "abstract": "Synchrony, the natural time-dependence of behavior in human interaction, is a pervasive feature of communication. However, most studies of synchrony have focused on dyadic interaction. In the current work, we explore synchrony in three-person teams using immersive virtual reality. Participants spent about two hours collaborating on four separate design tasks. The tracking data from the VR system allowed precise measurement of head and hand movements, facilitating calculation of synchrony. Results replicated previous work that found nonverbal synchrony in dyads in immersive VR. Moreover, we manipulated the context of the task environment, an informal garage or a traditional conference room. The environment for the task influenced synchrony, with higher levels occurring in the conference room than the garage. We also explored different methods of extending synchrony from dyads to triads, and explore the relationship of synchrony to turn taking and gaze. This paper provides theoretical insights about nonverbal synchrony and how design work functions in triads and provides suggestions for designers of VR to support good collaboration.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the extent of polarisation among theist versus atheist groups on Arab Twitter and their networks. We find four main self-identified groups of Arab users that can be distinguished by different attitudes to religion. In addition to Atheists and Theists, there are Rationalists, who promote rational thinking regardless of religious affiliation, and Tanweeri, who promote religious reforms. Through a keyword search of Twitter account handles and biographies, we identified 2,673 active, public Twitter accounts that clearly state whether they are Atheists, Theists, Tanweeri or Rationalists and analysed the interactions among themselves and the accounts that are followed, retweeted, or mentioned the most in their networks. Depending on the network analysed, we found between four and seven sub-communities that highlight the rich socio-cultural context in which discussions of religion, non-religion, and religious reform unfold. While there was clear online polarisation between atheists and theists, Rationalist and Tanweeri accounts are spread among the two polarised sides, acting as natural bridges. We also found a clear separation between Arab atheists who engage with Arab accounts promoting atheism and those who primarily engage with Western accounts promoting atheism. We discuss implications for the study of religious debate and religious polarisation on social media.",

      "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) applications can enable geographically distant users to collaborate using shared video feeds or interactive 3D holograms, and may be particularly useful in the socially distant context of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, a good user experience is key for their success and could be negatively impacted by network impairments, which are an inevitable occurrence in today’s best-effort Internet. In this paper, we present the findings of an empirical user study, aimed at understanding the effects of network outages, on user experience and behavior, in a collaborative AR task. We highlight how network outages affected users in different ways depending on their role in the collaborative task, and how giving users explicit information about poor network conditions helped them deal with some of these negative effects. Furthermore, we report the strategies that users themselves adopted, to deal with outages, such as batching instructions, or shifting to a different spatial referencing style when communicating with their partners. Lastly, based on our findings, we present some design implications for future remote-collaborative AR application.",

      "abstract": "The convergence of networked digital infrastructures and built environments have given rise to the “urban user”, a conflation of “the user” and “the resident” or “the citizen”. The urban user and the city infrastructures are mutually constituted phenomena formed through the interactions between them. In this research, we contribute an ethnographic study that focuses on the everyday interactions between the urban user and water infrastructures in Pune, India. Using Nikhil Anand’s concept of “hydraulic citizenship” to analyze our ethnographic data, we showcase the mutually constitutive process of infrastructuring and subjectivization of the “citizen”, bringing attention to the ad hoc, heterogeneously constituted water infrastructures in Pune that aspire to be “smart” even before becoming functional infrastructures. In doing so, we hope to expand possible research trajectories within smart city research agendas by decoupling it from Western assumptions and also by linking them to an interactional account of the everyday relationships among residents, infrastructures, and municipalities",

      "abstract": "Designing future IoT ecosystems requires new approaches and perspectives to understand everyday practices. While researchers recognize the importance of understanding social aspects of everyday objects, limited studies have explored the possibilities of combining data-driven patterns with human interpretations to investigate emergent relationships among objects. This work presents Thing Constellation Visualizer (thingCV), a novel interactive tool for visualizing the social network of objects based on their co-occurrence as computed from a large collection of photos. ThingCV enables perspective-changing design explorations over the network of objects with scalable links. Two exploratory workshops were conducted to investigate how designers navigate and make sense of a network of objects through thingCV. The results of eight participants showed that designers were actively engaged in identifying interesting objects and their associated clusters of related objects. The designers projected social qualities onto the identified objects and their communities. Furthermore, the designers changed their perspectives to revisit familiar contexts and to generate new insights through the exploration process. This work contributes a novel approach to combining data-driven models with designerly interpretations of thing constellation towards More-Than Human-Centred Design of IoT ecosystems.",

      "abstract": "Today, teachers have been increasingly relying on data-driven technologies to track and monitor student behavior data for classroom management. Drawing insights from interviews with 20 K-8 teachers, this paper unpacks how teachers enacted both care and control through their data work in collecting, interpreting, and using student behavior data. In this process, teachers found themselves subject to surveilling gazes from parents, school administration, and students. As a result, teachers had to manipulate the student behavior data to navigate the balance between presenting a professional image to surveillants and enacting care/control that they deemed appropriate. This paper identifies and unpacks two nuanced forms of teachers' data work that have been understudied in CSCW: 1) data work as recontextualizing meanings and 2) data work as resisting surveillance. We discuss teachers' struggle over (in)visibility and their negotiation of autonomy and subjectivity in these two forms of data work. We highlight the importance of foregrounding and making space for data workers' (in our case, teachers') resistance and negotiation of autonomy in light of datafication. ",

Though some research has identified benefits and challenges of online peer-support, there is a limited understanding of how to best prepare and scaffold for untrained peer supporters as they attempt to become skillful in an online setting. We recruited 30 (15 pairs) participants to engage in an online support conversation about procrastination problems, gave one member of each pair minimal training in the principles and strategies of motivational interviewing, and used interviews and conversation transcripts to examine challenges novice helpers faced when providing support and learning new conversational skills. We presented the helpers with two conversation goals to achieve with the conversation: building understanding, and promoting readiness for change. The research identified the common strategies the helpers used to achieve these goals and the challenges they faced. We also discuss theoretical and design implications for platform designers to better scaffold this experience.",

      "abstract": "Manipulation defines many of our experiences as a consumer, including subtle nudges and overt advertising campaigns that seek to gain our attention and money. With the advent of digital services that can continuously optimize online experiences to favor stakeholder requirements, increasingly designers and developers make use of \"dark patterns\"â€”forms of manipulation that prey on human psychologyâ€”to encourage certain behaviors and discourage others in ways that present unequal value to the end user. In this paper, we provide an account of end user perceptions of manipulation that builds on and extends notions of dark patterns. We report on the results of a survey of users conducted in English and Mandarin Chinese (n=169), including follow-up interviews from nine survey respondents. We used a card sorting method to support thematic analysis of responses from each cultural context, identifying both qualitatively-supported insights to describe end users' felt experiences of manipulative products and a continuum of manipulation. We further support this analysis through a descriptive analysis of survey results and the presentation of examples from the interviews. We conclude with implications for future research, considerations for public policy, and guidance on how to further empower and give users autonomy in their experiences with digital services.",

      "abstract": "Nutrition is a key determinant of long-term health, and social influence has long been theorized to be a key determinant of nutrition. It has been difficult to quantify the postulated role of social influence on nutrition using traditional methods such as surveys, due to the typically small scale and short duration of studies. To overcome these limitations, we leverage a novel source of data: logs of 38 million food purchases made over an 8-year period on a major university campus, linked to anonymized individuals via the smartcards used to make on-campus purchases. In a longitudinal observational study, we ask: How is a person's food choice affected by eating with someone else whose own food choice is healthy vs. unhealthy? To estimate causal effects from the passively observed log data, we control confounds in a matched quasi-experimental design: we identify focal users who at first do not have any regular eating partners but then start eating with a fixed partner regularly, and we match focal users into comparison pairs such that paired users are nearly identical with respect to covariates measured before acquiring the partner, but the two focal users' new eating partners diverge in the healthiness of their respective food choice. A difference-in-differences analysis of the paired data yields clear evidence of social influence: focal users acquiring a healthy-eating partner change their habits significantly more toward healthy foods than focal users acquiring an unhealthy-eating partner. We further identify foods whose purchase frequency is impacted significantly by the eating partner's healthiness of food choice. Overall, this work demonstrates the utility of passively sensed food purchase logs for deriving insights with the potential of informing how food is offered, especially on university campuses.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the dissemination, situated fact-checking processes, and social effects of COVID-19 related online and offline misinformation in rural Bangladeshi life. A six-month-long ethnographic study in three villages found villagers perceived a lack of knowledge and experience among local medical professionals and often fell for flashy promotions of unreliable and unconfirmed cures. Villagers built on their local beliefs and myths, religious faiths, and social justice sensibilities while fact-checking suspicious information. They often reported being misled by misinformation that caters to these values, and they further spread this information through conversations with friends and family. Based on our findings, we argue that CSCW and HCI researchers should study misinformation and situated fact-checking together as a communal practice to design appropriate wellbeing technologies and social media for given communities.",

      "abstract": "Sustainable HCI (SHCI) researchers have historically looked to small and urban farmers to help situate and extend notions of sustainability within economic, social, and political frameworks. In the face of climate change and the Anthropocene, however, we ask how designing like the alternative farming practices of small and urban farmers might open up new, ecological approaches to agricultural technology. We conducted ethnographic field work with small farmers and their community in Indiana and show how they are challenging “agrilogistics,” defined by philosopher Timothy Morton as a strict separation of nature and culture in food production, a separation, he argues, which underlies the substantial agricultural contributions to climate change. Our ethnography led us to suggest new possibilities for design of agricultural technology that support ecological thinking and caring for more-than-human actors through visceral imaginaries, posthuman storytelling, and engaging curiosity, possibilities which may offer ways to disentangle agricultural technology from agrilogistic paradigms.",

      "abstract": "Many benefits of online communities---such as obtaining new information, opportunities, and social connections---increase with size. Thus, a ``successful'' online community often evokes an image of hundreds of thousands of users, and practitioners and researchers alike have sought to devise methods to achieve growth and thereby, success. On the other hand, small online communities exist in droves and many persist in their smallness over time. Turning to the highly popular discussion website Reddit, which is made up of hundreds of thousands of communities, we conducted a qualitative interview study examining how and why people participate in these persistently small communities, in order to understand why these communities exist when popular approaches would assume them to be failures. Drawing from twenty interviews, this paper makes several contributions: we describe how small communities provide unique informational and interactional spaces for participants, who are drawn by the hyperspecific aspects of the community; we find that small communities do not promote strong dyadic interpersonal relationships but rather promote group-based identity; and we highlight how participation in small communities is part of a broader, ongoing strategy to curate participants' online experience. We argue that online communities can be seen as nested niches: parts of an embedded, complex, symbiotic socio-informational ecosystem. We suggest ways that social computing research could benefit from more deliberate considerations of interdependence between diverse scales of online community sizes.",

      "abstract": "Data protection regulatory policies, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), force website operators to request users' consent before collecting any personal information revealed through their web browsing. Website operators, motivated by the potential value of the collected personal data, employ various methods when designing consent notices (e.g., dark patterns) in order to convince users to allow the collection of as much of their personal data as possible. In this paper, we design and conduct a user study where 1100 MTurk workers interact with eight different designs of cookie consent notices. We show that the nudging designs used in the different cookie consent notices have a large effect on the choices user make. Our results show that colour-based nudging bars can have a significant impact on the participants' decisions to change the default cookie settings, despite using dark patterns. Also, in contrast to previous works, we report that users who do not use ad-blocking software are less likely to modify default cookie settings. Our findings demonstrate the importance of nudged interfaces and the effects that orthogonal nudging techniques can have on users' choices.",

Emergent community response is a common phenomenon during crisis, but mutual aid in the pandemic took on a distinct character, drawing on traditions of political and community organizing. Our research into these activities suggests that mutual aid organizing in relation to disaster is growing practice but remains evolving and contested. Drawing on interviews with organizers of mutual aid groups in New York, we identify a series of four dilemmas that mutual aid organizers encountered in their work, with impacts on their organizational strategy and technology choices. We then raise three implications for crisis informatics to support community response to disaster: taking a long view of crises, centering questions of equity, and adopting a transformative vision of emergency response.

This particularly disadvantages socially and economically marginalized job seekers who are already being pushed into lower-wage precarious work with increasing levels of job insecurity. While the number of employment support tools that match job seekers to employers has been growing, marginalized job seekers still significantly rely on physical employment centers that have a track record of supporting the specific needs associated with marginalization and economic constraints. We drew from prior HCI and CSCW literature uncovering the employment and technology-related challenges that marginalized job seekers face and\r\nfrom the Psychology of Working Theory to frame our research questions and results. To complement this prior work, we investigated how employment center staff work with marginalized job seekers and moderate factors to securing decent work. We found in an interview of 21 employment center staff\\textemdash career advisors and business services coordinators\\textemdash that they performed significant work to prepare and encourage marginalized job seekers in applying to positions, while also training employers to be more inclusive and open-minded. Career advisors worked directly with job seekers to connect them with external resources, provide encouragement, strategize long-term goals, and mitigate feelings of stigma. Business services coordinators worked directly with employers to prepare job positions and employee support programs. Drawing from the expertise of employment centers, we contribute a framework for designing employment support tools that better serve the needs of marginalized job seekers, and outline tangible design implications that complement the support these organizations provide.",

      "abstract": "Online platforms such as multiplayer online games often struggle with widespread toxic behaviors such as flaming, harassment, and hate speech. To discipline their users, platforms usually adopt a punitive approach that issues punishments ranging from a warning message to content removal to permanent ban (PB). As the harshest punishment that a platform does to its user, PB deprives the user of their privileges on the platform, such as account access and purchased content. But little is known regarding the disciplinary effect of PB on the user community. In this study, we analyzed PB in League of Legends, one of the largest online games today. We identified five distinct player discourses regarding PB, revealing how PB is only nominally a disciplinary device, and functions primarily as a platform rhetoric. Our findings amounted to the recognition of a restorative approach, and more specifically, the need to contextualize toxicity.",

      "abstract": "While many technology-based approaches to support people living with HIV target specific clinical goals, recent work has begun to consider how to design support in the context of HIV stigma. Here, we consider two challenges; the first, and central challenge is how to work with a small group of stakeholders to design for the much larger, but hard to access, population of HIV positive individuals. Addressing the first challenge, we introduce the Narrative Tapestry design process, which is our main contribution, and helps create a generative third space wherein stakeholders draw on their cultural knowledge to reflect on common experiences of living with HIV. The second challenge is how to design a platform that is less likely to disintegrate as people transition through phases of living with a stigmatized identity. Applying the Narrative Tapestry process led us to insights that both demonstrate the value of the design process and partially address this second challenge. We find that social support can be a critical lifeline following an HIV diagnosis, but that when people have normalized their identity, this need can give way to a desire to address stigma directly. We propose combining social support tools with a set of features that enable people to work as change-agents to address stigma in their local communities. We argue that this type of platform would help to retain senior members who can serve both as community caretakers as well as role models for newcomers.",

      "abstract": "Built-in pervasive cameras have become an integral part of mobile/wearable devices and enabled a wide range of ubiquitous applications with their ability to be ``always-on’’. In particular, life-logging has been identified as a means to enhance the quality of life of older adults by allowing them to reminisce about their own life experiences. However, the sensitive images captured by the cameras threaten individuals' right to have private social lives and raise concerns of privacy and security in the physical world. This threat gets worse when image recognition technologies can link images to people, scenes, and objects, hence, implicitly and unexpectedly reveal more sensitive information such as social connections.\r\nIn this paper, we first examine life-log images obtained from 54 older adults to extract (a) the artifacts or visual cues, and (b) the context of the image that influences an older life-logger's ability to recall the life events associated with a life-log image. We call these artifacts and contextual cues ``stimuli''. Using the set of stimuli extracted, we then propose a set of obfuscation strategies that naturally balances the trade-off between reminiscability and privacy (revealing social ties) while selectively obfuscating parts of the images. More specifically, our platform yields privacy-utility tradeoff by compromising, on average, modest 13.4% reminiscability scores while significantly improving privacy guarantees -- around 40% error in cloud estimation.",

      "abstract": "In contrast to existing, static audience controls that map poorly onto users’ ideal audiences on social networking sites, dynamic audience selection (DAS) controls can make intelligent inferences to help users’ select their ideal audience given context and content. But does this potential utility outweigh its potential intrusiveness? We surveyed 250 participants to identify model users’ ideal versus their chosen audiences with static controls and found a significant misalignment, suggesting that DAS might provide utility. We then designed a sensitizing prototype that allowed users to select audiences based on personal attributes, content, or context constraints. We evaluated DAS vis-a-vis Facebook’s existing audience selection controls through a counterbalanced summative evaluation. We found that DAS’s expressiveness, customizability, and scalability made participants feel more confident about the content they shared on Facebook. However, low transparency, distrust in algorithmic inferences, and the emergence of privacy-violating side channels made participants find the prototype unreliable or intrusive. We discuss factors that affected this trade-off between DAS’s utility and intrusiveness and synthesize design implications for future audience selection tools.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown lead to the rapid adoption and use of various groupware applications(“apps”) for remote connection with colleagues, friends, and family. Different factors such as user experiences,  trust, and social influences (“user-situational motivations”) were instrumental in determining how and what apps people adopted and used, especially at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this empirical study, we examine how these factors and four predominant user-situational motivations (i.e., the mandated use of an app by an employer/institution, recommended use of an app by an employer/institution, recommended use of an app by a peer(s), and self-selection of an app) influenced the rapid adoption and use of groupware applications. Specifically, we develop an “emergency adoption model” of groupware applications using 195 valid survey responses to highlight the factors that motivated these apps’ use at the onset of COVID-19pandemic lockdown. We leverage the Technology Adoption Model (TAM) and integrate it with the users’ past use of the application before the COVID-19 lockdown, user-situational motivation, and their privacy-related trust in the application provider to develop a more comprehensive model. Using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM), we find that the users who used a groupware app in the past continued to use it, and in line with TAM, users’ intention to adopt and use a groupware application was largely driven by the ease-of-use and usefulness of the app. Furthermore, while not a part of the traditionalTAM model, we find that trust in the application provider plays an important role in emergency adoption. However, unlike typical adoption models, the nature of all these effects—most prominently that related to privacy-related trust—depend on the underlying situational motivation. We discuss the implications of these findings and suggest ways to improve the adoption and use of groupware applications, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "abstract": "Digital intervention tools against problematic smartphone usage help users control their consumption on smartphones, for example, by setting a time limit on an app. However, today's social media apps offer a mix of quasiessential and addictive features in an app (e.g., Instagram has following feeds, recommended feeds, stories, and direct messaging features), which makes it hard to apply a uniform logic for all uses of an app without a nuanced understanding of feature-level usage behaviors. We study when and why people regret using different features of social media apps on smartphones. We examine regretful feature uses in four smartphone social media apps (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and KakaoTalk) by utilizing feature usage logs, ESM surveys on regretful use collected for a week, and retrospective interviews from 29 Android users. In determining whether a feature use is regretful, users considered different types of rewards they obtained from using a certain feature (i.e., social, informational, personal interests, and entertainment) as well as alternative rewards they could have gained had they not used the smartphone (e.g., productivity). Depending on the types of rewards and the way rewards are presented to users, probabilities to regret vary across features of the same app. We highlight three patterns of features with different characteristics that lead to regretful use. First, \"following\"-based features (e.g., Facebook's News Feed and Instagram's Following Posts and Stories) induce habitual checking and quickly deplete rewards from app use. Second, recommendation-based features situated close to actively used features (e.g., Instagram's Suggested Posts adjacent to Search) cause habitual feature tour and sidetracking from the original intention of app use. Third, recommendation-based features with bite-sized contents (e.g., Facebook's Watch Videos) induce using \"just a bit more,\" making people fall into prolonged use. We discuss implications of our findings for how social media apps and intervention tools can be designed to reduce regretful use and how feature-level usage information can strengthen self-reflection and behavior changes.",

      "abstract": "Online creative communities are increasingly a space for marginalized groups to build solidarity and engage in activist work, encouraging the exploration and articulation of intersectionally-marginalized identities through processes of creative production. One such context for creative production includes community-driven sites such as \\textit{Archive of Our Own}, which by their design are intended to leverage and effectively support voices that are marginalized on other social platforms. In this paper, we build upon work on creative production and fan communities to further describe the work of fanart and fanzine collectives. We share the results of 1) an interview study with fanzine producers and 2) a two month remote co-design study where we further explored fanzine culture and the potential of future archival support. We used a range of qualitative methods to investigate themes of activism co-production in relation to the fanzine work of these producers, seeking to identify characteristic barriers and opportunities for community support as these artists seek to promote their work, encourage the co-production of work with other artists, and navigate the constantly shifting legal landscape associated with fanart. We conclude with implications for creative community support that amplify marginalized voices and facilitate archival work at the intersection of visual art, folksonomy, and legality.",

      "abstract": "As image-based classifiers' application areas diversify, capturing human annotators' subjective responses in the data acquisition process is becoming crucial. In such scenarios, however, eliciting a response from human labelers in a reliable and cost-efficient manner has been a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we seek to understand how applying different sequencing strategies in batch image labeling can impact human annotators' labeling performances. In particular, we developed three different sequencing strategies: (1) uncertainty-based labeling (UL), a sequencing strategy that prioritizes images that a classifier predicts with the highest uncertainty, and (2) certainty-based labeling (CL), a reverse strategy of UL that presents images with the highest prediction probability first, and (3) random, a baseline approach that randomly chooses a set of images in batch forming. Although UL and CL are the strategies that select images to-be-surfaced based on a classifier's point-of-view, we hypothesized that human annotators' perception and labeling performance may vary depending on the different sequencing strategies. In our study, we identified that participants were able to recognize a different level of perceived cognitive load across three conditions (CL the easiest and UL the hardest), while found a trade-off between labeling reliability (CL and UL more reliable than random) and task efficiency (UL the most efficient while CL the least efficient). Based on the results, we discuss the implications of design for data scientists who may consider applying different sequencing strategies in collecting image labels at scale for subjective tasks. Then we suggest possible future research areas.",

To understand how the disruption caused by SARS-CoV2-2 impacted dynamics around technology use within Asian Indian families with teens in the U.S., we conducted a mixed-methods study with 22 Asian Indian parent-teen dyads of different socioeconomic status (SES). Based on our empirical data, we present the complex picture of technology use in Asian Indian families during a period of disruption. We discuss the differences and similarities in (a) tensions that emerged in regard to technology use and mediation as participants from different SESs adjusted their daily life routines and (b) the ways technology helped them to develop practices that contributed to family resilience. Finally, we offer recommendations for the designers of technologies that can support parents and teens not only in times of crisis, but also under normal circumstances. ",

      "abstract": "This paper illustrates the multifaceted aspects of caring practices, and the ways they are entangled with the organizing work of community-driven initiatives. Seeking to highlight the situated inter-dependencies  between concerns for care and efficiency, and considering caring practices as essential to the practical work that makes communities work, we reflect on how caring and efficiency rationalities frame the use, and scope the design of digital technologies. Drawing on two cases, the analysis addresses specific aspects of community organizing whereby concerns for care and efficiency are intertwined. It shows the ways existing, digital technologies oftentimes overshadow communities' key concerns for care, and how attempts to design for community settings often results in anti-designs, that is sociotechnical configurations that can disrupt caring practices. The contribution of the paper is twofold, an analysis of prominent examples of intertwined caring and efficiency, and a focus on caring in the design and appropriation of technologies into this space.",

      "abstract": "With the widespread use of toxic language online, platforms are increasingly using automated systems that leverage advances in natural language processing to automatically flag and remove toxic comments. However, most automated systems---while detecting and moderating toxic language---do not provide feedback to their users, let alone provide an avenue of recourse for users to make actionable changes. We present our work, RECAST, an interactive, open-sourced web tool for visualizing these models' toxic predictions, while providing alternative suggestions for flagged toxic language and a new path of recourse for users. RECAST highlights text responsible for classifying toxicity, and allows users to interactively substitute potentially toxic phrases with neutral alternatives. We examined the effect of RECAST via two large-scale user evaluations, and find that RECAST was highly effective at helping users reduce toxicity as detected through the model, and users gain a stronger understanding of the underlying toxicity criterion used by black-box models, enabling transparency and recourse. In addition we found that when users focus on optimizing language for these models instead of their own judgement (which is the implied incentive and goal of deploying such models at all) these models cease to be effective classifiers of toxicity compared to human annotations. This opens a discussion for how toxicity detection models work and should work, and their effect on future discourse.",

      "abstract": "Parents’ use of mobile devices (tablets and mobile phones) while caring for children is considered to be beneficial, but also problematic. In this study, we aimed to understand parents’ technology non-/use practices around infants and toddlers in the domestic setting and to survey parents’ opinions about their partners’ practices. To this end, we collected data from parents from seventeen families, using diaries and interviews. We found that as parents grapple with multiple and often conflicting motivations and needs, they adopt or shift among four non-/use positions. Our findings also show that adult family members believe that their partner’s use is more problematic than theirs and that the other person does not abide by mutually decided norms. Furthermore, parents often have conflicting opinions about how one should shape one’s technological practices around children. Based on our findings, we propose new design directions for technology that can support caregivers in the domestic setting. ",

      "abstract": "Wikipedia articles aim to be definitive sources of encyclopedic content. Yet, only 0.6% of Wikipedia articles have high quality according to its quality scale due to insufficient number of Wikipedia editors and enormous number of articles. Supervised Machine Learning (ML) quality improvement approaches that can automatically identify and fix content issues rely on manual labels of individual Wikipedia sentence quality. However, current labeling approaches are tedious and produce noisy labels. Here, we propose an automated labeling approach that identifies the semantic category (e.g., adding citations, clarifications) of historic Wikipedia edits and uses the modified sentences prior to the edit as examples that require that semantic improvement. Highest-rated article sentences are examples that no longer need semantic improvements. We show that training existing sentence quality classification algorithms on our labels improves their performance compared to training them on existing labels. Our work shows that editing behaviors of Wikipedia editors provide better labels than labels generated by crowdworkers who lack the context to make judgments that the editors would agree with.",

      "abstract": "Parental control apps, which are mobile apps that allow parents to monitor and restrict their children's activities online, are becoming increasingly adopted by parents as a means of safeguarding their children's online safety.  However, it is not clear whether these apps are always beneficial or effective in what they aim to do; for instance, the overuse of  restriction and surveillance has been found to undermine parent-child relationship and children's sense of autonomy. While previous research has categorised and taken inventory of key features of popular parental control apps, they have not systematically analysed the ways such features were designed or realised in such apps, or in particular how aspects of such designs might relate to parents and children's experiences with such apps.  In this work, we investigate this gap, asking specifically: how might children's and parents' perceptions be related to how parental control features were designed?  To investigate this question, we conducted an analysis of 58 top Android parental control apps designed for the purpose of promoting children's online safety, finding three major axes of variation in how key restriction and monitoring features were realised: granularity, feedback/transparency, and parent-child communications support. To relate these axes to perceived benefits and problems, we then analysed 3264 app reviews to identify references to aspects of the each of the axes above, to understand children's and parents' views of how such dimensions related to their experiences with these apps. Our findings led towards 1) an understanding of how parental control apps realise their functionalities differently along three axes of variation, 2) an analysis of exactly the ways that such variation influences children's and parents' perceptions, respectively of the usefulness or effectiveness of these apps, and finally 3) an identification of design recommendations and opportunities for future apps by contextualising our findings within existing digital parenting theories.",

      "abstract": "Large-scale data systems play an increasingly central role in how state bureaucracies and citizens come to know and navigate their relationship with each other. Such systems are endemically uneven in implementation, producing distributed and exclusionary consequences that are among their most important effects. These systems also operate as infrastructures in the rich and complex sense of the term that has been a core contribution of CSCW to the wider computing and social science fields. Building on James Scott’s work on ‘seeing like a state’, we conceptualize ‘seeing like an infrastructure’ as a more supple analytic perspective that maps the distributed work and uneven consequences through which designers, bureaucrats, and users (here, citizens) assign or claim representation in the consequential data systems that increasingly shape and define citizenship. Drawing on eighteen months of ethnographic fieldwork into Aadhaar, India’s biometrics-based identification project, and studies of infrastructure, marginalization, and citizenship in CSCW and allied fields, we argue that this perspective provides crucial insight into the strategies and mechanisms by which effective access to the basic rights and entitlements of citizenship are granted, claimed, and at times undermined. More specifically, we show how challenges in implementing Aadhaar’s three key processes—enrollment, seeding, and authentication—give rise to a spectrum of resolution in which the rights and entitlements of ‘high-resolution citizens’ are expanded, while those of ‘low-resolution citizens’ are curtailed.",

      "abstract": "Telehealth technologies have long remained on the peripheries of healthcare systems that prioritize in-person healthcare provision. The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has foregrounded the need to formalize telehealth infrastructures, particularly teleconsultations, to ensure continued care provision through remote mechanisms. In the Indian healthcare context, prior to the pandemic, teleconsultations have been used to substitute for in-person consultations when possible, and to facilitate remote follow-up care without exacerbating pressures on limited personal resources. We conducted a survey and interview study to investigate doctors' and patients' perceptions, experiences, and expectations around teleconsultations, and how these contribute towards supplementing healthcare infrastructures in India, focusing on the changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we describe the efforts of our participants towards infrastructuring telehealth, examining how technologies were adapted to support teleconsultation, how expectations shifted, and how the dynamics of caregiving evolved through this transition. We present implications for the future design and uptake of telehealth, arguing that COVID-19's impact on teleconsultations lays the foundation for new telehealth infrastructures for more inclusive and equitable care.",

      "abstract": "Besides the merits of increasing digitization and interconnectedness in private and professional spaces, critical infrastructures and societies are more and more exposed to cyberattacks. In order to enhance the preventative and reactive capabilities against cyberattacks, Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) are deployed in many countries and organizations. In Germany, CERTs in the public sector operate on federal and state level to provide information security services for authorities, citizens, and enterprises. Their tasks of monitoring, analyzing, and communicating threats and incidents is getting more complex due to the increasing amount of information disseminated into public channels. By adopting the perspectives of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Crisis Informatics, we contribute to the study of organizational structures, technology use, and the impact on collaborative practices in and between state CERTs with empirical research based on expert interviews with representatives of German state CERTs (N=15) and supplementary document analyses (N=25). We derive design and policy implications from our findings, including the need for interoperable and modular architecture, a shift towards service level agreements, cross-platform monitoring and analysis of incident data, use of deduplication techniques and standardized threat exchange formats, a reduction of resource costs through process automation, and transparent reporting and tool structures for information exchange.",

      "abstract": "Peer assessment, as a form of collaborative learning, can engage students in active learning and improve students' learning gains. However, current teaching platforms and programming environments provide little support to integrate peer assessment for in-class programming exercises. We identified challenges in conducting in-class programming exercises and adopting peer assessment through formative interviews with instructors of introductory programming courses. To address these challenges, we introduce PuzzleMe, a tool to help CS instructors to conduct engaging in-class programming exercises. PuzzleMe leverages peer assessment to support a collaboration model where students provide timely feedback on peers' work. We propose two assessment techniques tailored to in-class programming exercises: live peer testing and live peer code review. Live peer testing can improve students' code robustness by allowing students to create and share lightweight tests with peers. Live peer code review can improve students' code understanding by intelligently grouping students to maximize meaningful code reviews. A two-week deployment study revealed that PuzzleMe encourages students to write useful test cases, identify code problems, correct misunderstandings, and learn a diverse set of problem-solving approaches from peers.",

      "abstract": "Concerns about child physical and digital safety are emerging with families' adoption of smart home technologies such as robot vacuums and smart speakers. To better understand parents' definitions and perceptions of child safety regarding smart home technologies, we interviewed 23 parents who are smart home adopters. We contribute insights into parents' perceptions of the physical and digital safety risks smart home technologies pose to children, and how such perceptions formed and changed across three phases. In acquiring smart home devices, parents already considered whether the device could cause physical harm to their children or pose privacy and security risks. Once children become active users of smart home technologies, parents however reported encountering unanticipated physical safety risks and digital safety issues (e.g., exposure to unsuitable content) that required their mitigation strategies. As their children grow up, parents further expressed the need to shift attention from physical safety to digital safety. Parents' safety perceptions influence how they involve children in smart home interactions and implement mitigation strategies, such as restricting access to certain devices and using parental controls. We identify six factors that shape parents' perception and evaluation of smart home safety risks to children, including parenting style, parents' tech-savviness, parents' trust in tech companies, children's age and developmental differences, news media, and device characteristics. We provide design and policy recommendations to better protect children's safety in the smart home environment.",

      "abstract": "Home care workers (HCWs) are increasingly central to post-acute and long-term health services in the United States.  \\update{Despite being a critical component of day-to-day care of home-dwelling adults, these workers often feel underappreciated and isolated on the job} and come from low-income and marginalized backgrounds.  Leveraging the support of peers is one potential way to empower HCWs, but peer support encompasses a broad range of activities and aspects.  Traditional conceptions of peer support may not be appropriate to the home care context, as HCWs are a distributed workforce who have few opportunities to interact with each other.  In this study, we explore how HCWs value and conceptualize peer support.  Our findings demonstrate the importance of peer support in performing the emotional labor of home care work and ongoing attempts to strategically frame the home care profession as essential and medical in nature.  Our results ground design implications for technology-enabled peer support based on the power dynamics of our participants’ context and allow us to engage with issues where technology design for empowerment intersects with exploitation in distributed or crowd work, emotional labor, and tacit knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Managing digital privacy and security is often a collaborative process, where groups of individuals work together to share information and give one another advice. Yet, this collaborative process is not always reciprocal or equally shared. In many cases, individuals with more expertise help others without receiving help in return. Therefore, we studied the phenomenon of “Tech Caregiving\" by surveying 20 groups (112 individuals) comprised of friends, family members, and/or co-workers who identified at least one member of their group as a someone who provides informal technical support to the people they know. We found that tech caregivers reported significantly higher levels of power use and self-efficacy for digital privacy and security, compared to tech caregivees. However, caregivers and caregivees did not differ based on their self-reported community collective efficacy for collaboratively managing privacy and security together as a group. This finding demonstrates the importance of tech caregiving and community belonging in building community collective efficacy for digital privacy and security. We also found that caregivers and caregivees most often communicated via text message or phone when coordinating support, which was most frequently needed when troubleshooting or setting up new devices. Meanwhile, discussions specific to privacy and security represented only a small fraction of the issues for which participants gave or received tech care. Thus, we conclude that educating tech caregivers on how to provide privacy and security-focused support, as well as designing technologies that facilitate such support, has the potential to create positive networks effects towards the collective management of digital privacy and security.\r\n",

      "abstract": "This article uses findings from a field study of the world’s largest guaranteed employment scheme (NREGA) in India to understand how digital technology mediates work relations and power dynamics within a bureaucracy. In this initiative, upper-level bureaucrats in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh built a digital network to remove local discretion at the “last mile” of an implementation of NREGA. I show how digital infrastructure affords actors at both the first and last mile opportunities to modify software to control as well as subvert certain practices. This article refers to this dialectic phenomenon as “governance by patching” and defines it as a socio-technical instantiation of a top-down process that focuses on small changes, iterative, and political process for positive change. Governance by patching is, therefore, neither a purely technical process nor an exclusively administrative one, but refers to the ability to fix unanticipated problems that arise in the implementation of governance programs by altering the socio-technical systems. The struggle for power continues, but on the new digital terrain.   ",

      "abstract": "Twitter users signal social identity in their profile descriptions, or bios, in a number of important but complex ways that are not well-captured by existing characterizations of how identity is expressed in language. Better ways of defining and measuring these expressions may therefore be useful both in understanding how social identity is expressed in text, and how the self is presented on Twitter. To this end, the present work makes three contributions. First, using qualitative methods, we \\hl{identify and} define the concept of a personal identifier, which is more representative of the ways in which identity is signaled in Twitter bios. Second, we propose a method to extract all personal identifiers expressed in a given bio. Finally, we present a series of validation analyses that explore the strengths and limitations of our proposed method. Our work opens up exciting new opportunities at the intersection between the social psychological study of social identity and the study of how we compose the self through markers of identity on Twitter and in social media more generally.",

However, only investing in worker-centric needs, such as skill improvement, often conflicts with short-term platform-centric needs, such as task throughput. This paper studies learning strategies in task assignment in crowdsourcing and their impact on platform-centric needs. We formalize learning potential of individual tasks and collaborative tasks, and devise an iterative task assignment and completion approach that implements strategies grounded in learning theories. We conduct experiments to compare several learning strategies in terms of skill improvement, and in terms of task throughput and contribution quality. We discuss how our findings open new research directions in learning and collaboration.",

We contribute a mixed methods study analyzing the impact of smartphone use on teachers' work lives in low-income Indian schools. Findings from 70 interviews and 1,361 survey responses suggest that although smartphones aid teaching and administrative functions, smartphone use also significantly predicts burnout among teachers, with technostress providing a major explanation for this relationship. We reveal how teachers’ work is constantly surveilled and monitored via technology and how teachers' personal smartphones were controlled and repurposed through socio-technical structures by the higher management to serve management's goals, substantially increasing the work teachers were required to perform outside of work hours. We then extend technostress in HCI4D contexts and discuss the need to develop better support structures for teachers and rethink how smartphones are used in their work.",

In this paper, we introduce the Curiosity Notebook, a web-based research infrastructure for studying learning by teaching via the use of a teachable agent.  We describe and provide rationale for the set of features that are essential for such a research infrastructure, outline how these features have evolved over two design iterations of the Curiosity Notebook and through two studies---a 4-week field study with 12 elementary school students interacting with a NAO robot and an hour-long online observational study with 41 university students interacting with an agent---demonstrate the utility of our platform for making observations of learning by teaching phenomena in diverse learning environments.  Based on these findings, we conclude the paper by reflecting on our design evolution and envisioning future iterations of the Curiosity Notebook.  ",

      "abstract": "Although AI holds promise for improving human decision making in societally critical domains, it remains an open question how human-AI teams can reliably outperform AI alone and human alone in challenging prediction tasks (also known as complementary performance). We explore two directions to understand the gaps in achieving complementary performance. First, we argue that the typical experimental setup limits the potential of human-AI teams. To account for lower AI performance out-of-distribution than in-distribution because of distribution shift, we design experiments with different distribution types and investigate human performance for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution examples. Second, we develop novel interfaces to support interactive explanations so that humans can actively engage with AI assistance. Using virtual pilot studies and large-scale randomized experiments across three tasks, we demonstrate a clear difference between in-distribution and out-of-distribution, and observe mixed results for interactive explanations: while interactive explanations improve human perception of AI assistance’s usefulness, they may reinforce human biases and lead to limited performance improvement. Overall, our work points out critical challenges and future directions towards enhancing human performance with AI assistance.",

      "abstract": "Live streaming refers to the broadcast of real-time videos, allowing people to have synchronous interactions. While researchers’ interest in live streaming has increased recently, the accessibility of live streaming for people with visual impairments is still under-examined. Further studies are necessary to gain a better understanding of how streamers with visual impairments (SVI) engage in various activities on live streaming platforms. Based on semi-structured interviews with 14 participants, we identified SVI’s motivations for live streaming, their unique interactions with videos and people on live streaming platforms, and the challenges they face during live streaming. Our analysis of the identified themes revealed the absence of an SVI-centered community and accessibility issues for SVI while learning to live stream, use tools, and interact with people. Based on the results of this study, we present design opportunities to better support SVI on live streaming platforms.",

      "abstract": "To manage user-generated harmful video content, YouTube relies on AI algorithms (e.g., machine learning) in content moderation and follows a retributive justice logic to punish convicted YouTubers through demonetization, a penalty that limits or deprives them of advertisements (ads), reducing their future ad income. Moderation research is burgeoning in CSCW, but relatively little attention has been paid to the socioeconomic implications of YouTube’s algorithmic moderation. Drawing from the lens of algorithmic labor, we describe how algorithmic moderation shapes YouTubers’ labor conditions through algorithmic opacity and precarity. YouTubers coped with such challenges from algorithmic moderation by sharing and applying practical knowledge they learned about algorithms. By analyzing video content creation as algorithmic labor, we unpack the socioeconomic implications of algorithmic moderation and point to necessary post-punishment support as a form of restorative justice. Lastly, we put forward design considerations for algorithmic moderation systems.",

      "abstract": "Online videos are playing an increasingly important role in timely information dissemination especially during public crises. Video commentary, synchronous or asynchronous, are indispensable in viewers' engagement and participation, and may in turn contribute to video with additional information and emotions. Yet, the roles of video commentary in crisis communications are largely unexplored, which we believe that an investigation not only provides timely feedback but also offers concrete guidelines for better information dissemination. In this work, we study two distinct commentary features of online videos: traditional asynchronous comments and emerging synchronous danmaku. We investigate how users utilize these two features to express their emotions and share information during a public health crisis. Through qualitative analysis and applying machine learning techniques on a large-scale danmaku and comment dataset of Chinese COVID-19-related videos, we uncover the distinctive roles of danmaku and comments in crisis communication, and propose comprehensive taxonomies for information themes and emotion categories of commentary. We also discover the unique patterns of crisis communications presented by danmaku, such as collective emotional resonance and style-based highlighting for emphasizing critical information. Our study captures the unique values and salient features of the emerging commentary interfaces, in particular danmaku, in the context of crisis videos, and further provides several design implications to enable more effective communications through online videos to engage and empower users during crises.\r\n",

      "abstract": "A growing body of literature has proposed formal approaches to audit algorithmic systems for biased and harmful behaviors. While formal auditing approaches have been greatly impactful, they often suffer major blindspots, with critical issues surfacing only in the context of everyday use once systems are deployed. Recent years have seen many cases in which everyday users of algorithmic systems detect and raise awareness about harmful behaviors that they encounter in the course of their everyday interactions with these systems. However, to date little academic attention has been granted to these bottom-up, user-driven auditing processes. In this paper, we propose and explore the concept of everyday algorithm auditing, a process in which users detect, understand, and interrogate problematic machine behaviors via their day-to-day interactions with algorithmic systems. We argue that everyday users are powerful in surfacing problematic machine behaviors that may elude detection via more centrally-organized forms of auditing, regardless of users’ knowledge about the underlying algorithms. We analyze several real-world cases of everyday algorithm auditing, drawing lessons from these cases for the design of future platforms and tools that facilitate such auditing behaviors. Finally, we discuss work that lies ahead, toward bridging the gaps between formal auditing approaches and the organic auditing behaviors that emerge in everyday use of algorithmic systems.",

      "abstract": "Twitter uses machine learning to crop images, where crops are centered around the part predicted to be the most salient. In fall 2020, Twitter users raised concerns that the automated image cropping system on Twitter favored light-skinned over dark-skinned individuals, as well as concerns that the system favored cropping woman's bodies instead of their heads. In order to address these concerns, we conduct an extensive analysis using formalized group fairness metrics. We find systematic disparities in cropping and identify contributing factors, including the fact that the cropping based on the single most salient point can amplify the disparities because of an effect we term 'argmax bias'. However, we demonstrate that formalized fairness metrics and quantitative analysis on their own are insufficient for capturing the risk of representational harm in automatic cropping. We suggest the removal of saliency-based cropping in favor of a solution that better preserves user agency. For developing a new solution that sufficiently address concerns related to representational harm, our critique motivates a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods that include human-centered design.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Social media sites use content moderation to attempt to cultivate safe spaces with accurate information for their users. However, content moderation decisions may not be applied equally for all types of users, and may lead to disproportionate censorship related to people's genders, races, or political orientations. We conducted a mixed methods study involving qualitative and quantitative analysis of survey data to understand which types of social media users have content and accounts removed more frequently than others, what types of content and accounts are removed, and how content removed may differ between groups. We found that three groups of social media users in our dataset experienced content and account removals more often than others: political conservatives, transgender people, and Black people. However, the types of content removed from each group varied substantially. Conservative participants' removed content included content that was offensive or allegedly so, misinformation, Covid-related, adult, or hate speech. Transgender participants' content was often removed as adult despite following site guidelines, critical of a dominant group (e.g., men, white people), or specifically related to transgender or queer issues. Black participants' removed content was frequently related to racial justice or racism. More broadly, conservative participants' removals often involved harmful content removed according to site guidelines to create safe spaces with accurate information, while transgender and Black participants' removals often involved content related to expressing their marginalized identities that was removed despite following site policies or fell into content moderation gray areas. We discuss potential ways forward to make content moderation more equitable for marginalized social media users, such as embracing and designing specifically for content moderation gray areas.",

      "abstract": "Deplatforming refers to the permanent ban of controversial public figures with large followings on social media sites. In recent years, platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have deplatformed many influencers to curb the spread of offensive speech. We present a case study of three high-profile influencers who were deplatformed on Twitter—Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, and Owen Benjamin. Working with over 49M tweets, we found that deplatforming significantly reduced the number of conversations about all three individuals on Twitter. Further, analyzing the Twitter-wide activity of these influencers’ supporters, we show that the overall activity and toxicity levels of supporters declined after deplatforming. We contribute a methodological framework to systematically examine the effectiveness of moderation interventions and discuss broader implications of using deplatforming as a moderation strategy.",

      "abstract": "Research in sociology and linguistics shows that people use language not only to express their own identity but to understand the identity of others. Recent work established a connection between expression of identity and emoji usage on social media, through use of emoji skin tone modifiers. Motivated by that finding, this work asks if, as with language, readers are sensitive to such acts of self-expression and use them to understand the identity of authors. In behavioral experiments (n=488), where text and emoji content of social media posts were carefully controlled before being presented to participants, we find in the affirmative---emoji are a salient signal of author identity. That signal is distinct from, and complementary to, the one encoded in language. Participant groups (based on self-identified ethnicity) showed no differences in how they perceive this signal, except in the case of the default yellow emoji. While both groups associate this with a White identity, the effect was stronger in White participants. Our finding that emoji can index social variables will have experimental applications for researchers but also implications for designers: supposedly ``neutral`` defaults may be more representative of some users than others.",

      "abstract": " YouTube is not only a platform for content creators to share videos but also a virtual venue for hosting community activities, such as social media campaigns (SMCs). SMCs for public awareness is a growing and reoccurring phenomenon on YouTube, during which content creators make videos to engage their audience and raise awareness of global challenges. However, how the unique celebrity culture on YouTube affects collective actions is an underexplored area. This work examines an SMC on YouTube, #TeamTrees, initiated by a YouTube celebrity and sought to raise people's awareness of tree-planting and climate change. The authors annotated and analyzed 992 #TeamTrees videos to explore how YouTube celebrities, professionals, and amateurs in different channel topics diagnose problems, present solutions, and motivate actions. This study also looks into whether platform identities and framing activities affect campaign reach and engagement. Results suggest that #TeamTrees reached creators who are generally not active in social issues. The participating YouTubers were likely to motivate the viewers to donate and join celebrities' and community's actions, but less involved in examining the environmental problems. Celebrities' videos dominated the campaign's influence. Amateurs' videos had a higher engagement level, although they need more support to frame campaign activities. Based on these findings, we discuss design implications for video-sharing platforms to support future SMCs.",

      "abstract": "Speech-based interfaces that feature conversational agents have a diverse population of users, including children. While recent HCI research has investigated child-agent interactions in the context of speech-based interfaces with rare mention of sample populations' racial makeup, scant research has examined how racially minoritized groups, in particular Black youth, interact with such technologies. Subsequently, issues of race and racism continue to be largely neglected within the HCI community, contributing to technology that marginalizes Black people. Leveraging Black feminist epistemology as a critical framework, we engage Black students in the ideation process of conversational agents as speech-based interfaces, drawing attention to how race, gender, and class influence their design choices. Our findings reveal that Black students prefer custom-designed conversational agents that are modeled after Black women, possessing knowledge of Black culture and serving as life coaches to help them achieve their goals. We also confirm that the current design of speech-based interfaces perpetuates racism, reinforcing whiteness as the norm.",

      "abstract": "Peer review has been used in both online and offline classrooms to inspire creativity, gather feedback, and lessen instructor grading loads, especially for design-based tasks without definitive rubrics. To explore the nuances and quality of peer feedback, we developed UX Factor, a peer grading platform that aims to characterize the behavior of peer reviews and the consistency of the ranking models used to aggregate these reviews. This system harnesses the power of pairwise comparisons to minimize bias and encourage context-driven analysis. We adopted UX Factor in a user interface course of 133 students and teaching assistants (TAs) across 3 different individual design projects over a semester and found that the system was effective in eliciting high-quality feedback. We saw that raters have higher agreement than random preferences, and with at least 15 ratings per submission, a simple average of ratings produced rankings that were consistent to both the raw ratings and other more complex models. These rankings were robust to disagreeable raters and changing class sizes, demonstrating the potential of comparative peer review to match the quality of expert feedback at scale.",

A body of work suggests that introducing social signals to content can increase both the inequality and unpredictability of its success, but has only been shown in the context of music listening.  To further examine the effect of social influence on media popularity, we extend this research to the context of algorithmically-generated images by re-adapting Salganik et al's Music Lab experiment. On a digital platform where participants discover and curate AI-generated hybrid animals, we randomly assign both the knowledge of other participants' behavior and the visual presentation of the information. We successfully replicate the Music Lab's findings in the context of images, whereby social influence leads to an unpredictable winner-take-all market. However, we also find that social influence can lead to the emergence of local cultural trends that diverge from the status quo and are ultimately more diverse. We discuss the implications of these results for platform designers and animal conservation efforts. ",

      "abstract": "Smart city projects collect data on urban environments to identify problems, inform policymaking, and boost citizen engagement. Typically, this data is collected by static sensors placed around the city, which is not ideal for spatiotemporal needs of certain sensing applications such as air quality monitoring. Vehicular crowdsensing is an upcoming approach that addresses this problem by utilizing vehicles’ mobility to collect fine-grained city-scale data. Prior work has mainly focused on designing vehicular crowdsensing systems and related components, including incentive schemes, vehicle selection, and application-specific sensing, without understanding the motivations and challenges faced by drivers and passengers, the two key stakeholders of any vehicular crowdsensing solution. Our work aims to fill this gap. To understand drivers’ and passengers’ perspectives, we developed Turn2Earn, a generic vehicular crowdsensing system that incentivizes drivers to take specific routes for data collection. Turn2Earn system was deployed with 13 auto-rickshaw drivers for two weeks in Bangalore, India. Our drivers took 709 trips using Turn2Earn covering 79.2% of the city’s grid cells. Interviews with 13 drivers and 15 passengers revealed innovative information-based strategies adopted by the drivers to convince passengers in taking alternative routes, and passengers’ altruism in supporting the drivers. We uncovered novel insights, including viability of offered routes due to road closure, issues with electric vehicles, and selection bias among the drivers. We conclude with design recommendations to inform the future of vehicular crowdsensing, including engaging and incentivizing passengers, and criticality-based reward structure.",

      "abstract": "The individualistic nature of gig work allows workers to have high levels of flexibility, but it also leads to atomization, leaving them isolated from peer workers. In this paper, we employed a qualitative approach to understand how online social media groups provide informational and emotional support to physical gig workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that social media groups alleviate the atomization effect, as workers use these groups to obtain experiential knowledge from their peers, build connections, and organize collective action. However, we noted a reluctance among workers to share strategic information where there was a perceived risk of being competitively disadvantaged. In addition, we found that the diversity among gig workers has also led to limited empathy for one another, which further impedes the provision of emotional support. While social media groups could potentially become places where workers organize collective efforts, several factors, including the uncertainty of other workers' activities and the understanding of the independent contractor status, have diminished the effectiveness of efforts at collective action.",

      "abstract": "This paper examines the role played by informal mutual aid networks in mediating precarity for gig workers in Jakarta during COVID-19. Using an original survey of 350 mobility platform drivers conducted in May 2020 and a pre-pandemic set of semi-structured interviews with driver communities, I find that mutual aid dispersed through associative, informal labor networks became an essential infrastructure of support for drivers during the pandemic. However, results indicate this support was not universally accessible: the pre-pandemic structures of a driver’s community and the driver’s own participation within the community correlated with the magnitude of community support a driver reported receiving.\r\n\r\nBy putting CSCW literature in conversation with broader literature on informal urbanism, this paper shows how informal labor networks and mutual aid can be a transformative form of labor solidarity, even outside of formal union structures. By analyzing the forms and limits of these networks this paper also carries lessons in how to build solidarity amongst distributed workforces. At the same time, this study highlights the role of local socio-economic context in shaping gig worker experiences of the pandemic. Thus, it points to the need for more contextually driven analysis of both gig worker precarity and what are deemed effective forms of labor solidarity.    ",

While automated measures provide some protection, they cannot completely protect an organisation. In this case study, we use interviews and observations to explore the processes staff at a large University use when handling reports of malicious communication, including how the help desk processes reports, who they escalate them to, and how teams who manage protections like the firewalls and mail relays use reports to improve defences. We found that the process and work patterns are a distributed cognitive process requiring multiple distinct teams with narrow system access, and tactic knowledge. Sudden large campaigns were found to overwhelm the help desk with reports, greatly impacting staff's workflow and hindering effective application of mitigation's and the potential for learning. We detail potential improvements to the current ticketing system, and reflect on ITIL, the framework of best practices that informed the full process.",

We set out to understand how companies leverage public relations to influence expectations of privacy and privacy-related norms. To interrogate the discourse productions of companies in relation to privacy, we examine the blogs associated with three major social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram (both owned by Facebook Inc.), and Snapchat. We analyze privacy-related posts using critical discourse analysis to demonstrate how these powerful entities construct narratives about users and their privacy expectations. We find that each of these platforms often make use of discourse about “vulnerable” identities to invoke relations of power, while at the same time, advancing interpretations and values that favor data capitalism. Finally, we discuss how these public narratives might influence the construction of users’ own interpretations of appropriate privacy norms and conceptions of self. We contend that expectations of privacy and social norms are not simply artifacts of users’ own needs and desires, but co-constructions that reflect the influence of social media companies themselves.

      "abstract": "Crowdsourcing is popular for large-scale data collection and labeling, but a major challenge is on detecting low-quality submissions. Recent studies have demonstrated that behavioral features of workers are highly correlated with data quality and can be useful in quality control. However, these studies primarily leveraged coarsely extracted behavioral features, and did not further explore quality control at the fine-grained level, i.e., the annotation unit level. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and benefits of using fine-grained behavioral features, which are the behavioral features finely extracted from a worker's individual interactions with each single unit in a subtask, for quality control in crowdsourcing. We design and implement a framework named Fine-grained Behavior-based Quality Control (FBQC) that specifically extracts fine-grained behavioral features to provide three quality control mechanisms: (1) quality prediction for objective tasks, (2) suspicious behavior detection for subjective tasks, and (3) unsupervised worker categorization. Using the FBQC framework, we conduct two real-world crowdsourcing experiments and demonstrate that using fine-grained behavioral features is feasible and beneficial in all three quality control mechanisms. Our work provides clues and implications for helping job requesters or crowdsourcing platforms to further achieve better quality control.",

      "abstract": "Modern conversational agents such as Alexa and Google Assistant represent significant progress in speech recognition, natural language processing, and speech synthesis. But as these agents have grown more realistic, concerns have been raised over how their social nature might unconsciously shape our interactions with them. Through a survey of 500 voice assistant users, we explore whether users' relationships with their voice assistants can be quantified using the same metrics as social, interpersonal relationships; as well as if this correlates with how much they trust their devices and the extent to which they anthropomorphise them. Using Knapp's staircase model of human relationships, we find that not only can human-device interactions be modelled in this way, but also that relationship development with voice assistants correlates with increased trust and anthropomorphism.",

      "abstract": "Computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) researchers have plenty to say about designing through texts. However, the relationships between implementation and design are often misunderstood, by engineering project systems developers who design collaborative systems and others. This problem is not new; how to utilize CSCW insights effectively and correctly in engineering projects has long been a concern in the CSCW community. By reviewing year-long, multiple-site ethnographic studies in the maritime domain conducted since 2015, this paper reflects on the “reflexivity of account” and “professional vision” as complementary concepts for ensuring that actors’ actions and reasonings are designed in such a way that actors – in this case, maritime operators, systems developers, educators, policymakers and shipowners – are accountable in and through their member groups. Rather than generalizing my findings and my role in the maritime domain as explicit knowledge to help other CSCW researchers in studying engineering projects, the goal of this paper is to seek intersubjective knowledge of my fieldwork to trigger the utilization of CSCW insights as a fundamental basis for facilitating systems design. The aim is to shape and reshape systems in line with what those actors do in reality.",

      "abstract": "The speed of digital transformation has resulted in new challenges for job seekers to become lifelong learners and to develop new skills faster than before. In this paper, our main objective is to examine how online content can serve as indicators for changes to the Information Technology (IT) industry and its in-demand skills. To study this relationship, we collect Reddit posts to represent social media content and job postings to reflect the IT industry based on which we explore possible correlations between them. Further, we propose a methodology to quantitatively estimate the predictive power of social media content for future in-demand skills. Our results show that the frequency of skill-related conversations on Reddit correlates with the popularity of skills in job\r\nposting data. Additionally, our findings indicate that the number of social posts dedicated to a specific skill can be a strong indicator for future job requirements. This is an important finding because identifying what skills the labor force should acquire will assist job seekers to plan their lifelong learning objectives to (a) maximize their employability, (b) continuously update their skills to remain in demand, and (c) be informed and actively\r\nengaged in defining knowledge trends, rather than reactively becoming informed of the latest information.",

      "abstract": "YouTube is by far the largest host of user-generated video content worldwide. Alas, the platform also hosts inappropriate, toxic, and hateful content. One community that has often been linked to sharing and publishing hateful and misogynistic content is the so-called Involuntary Celibates (Incels), a loosely defined movement ostensibly focusing on men's issues. In this paper, we set out to analyze the Incel community on YouTube by focusing on this community's evolution over the last decade and understanding whether YouTube's recommendation algorithm steers users towards Incel-related videos. We collect videos shared on Incel communities within Reddit and perform a data-driven characterization of the content posted on YouTube. Among other things, we find that the Incel community on YouTube is getting traction and that during the last decade, the number of Incel-related videos and comments rose substantially. We also find that users have a 6.3% chance of being suggested an Incel-related video by YouTube's recommendation algorithm within five hops when starting from a non-Incel-related video. Overall, our findings paint an alarming picture of online radicalization: not only Incel activity is increasing over time, but platforms may also play an active role in steering users towards such extreme content.\r\n\r\n",

      "abstract": "People with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) need support to understand and articulate how their personal values relate to their health and health care. We developed three prototypes for supporting reflection values and health and tested them in a qualitative study involving 12 people with MCC. We identified benefits and limitations to building on patients’ existing visit-preparation practices; revealed varying levels of comfort with deep, exploratory reflection involving a facilitator; and found that reflection oriented toward the future could elicit hopeful attitudes and plans for change, while reflection on the past elicited strong resistance. We translated these findings into design guidelines for supporting collaborative reflection on values and health. We also discussed these findings in relation to previous literature on designing for reflection in three areas: shifting between self-guided and facilitator-guided reflection, balancing between outcome-oriented and exploratory reflection, and exploring temporality in reflection.",

      "abstract": "People are increasingly getting information and news from social media. On Twitter we are seeing the emergence of \"tweetorials\" -- long, explanatory Twitter threads written by experts. In this work we study tweetorials as a form of science writing. While scientists have begun to champion the importance of Twitter as a science communication medium, few have studied how people are successfully using this medium to communicate complex and nuanced ideas. To understand how tweetorials work, we curated a collection of 46 clear and engaging tweetorials from multiple domains. We analyzed these tweetorials for the writing techniques that they employ, and found that while tweetorials use many traditional science writing techniques, they also use more subjective language, actively build credibility, and incorporate media in unique ways. In addition, we report on a workshop we ran to aid science PhD students in writing tweetorials, and find that while providing common tweetorial techniques improves their writing, the students still struggle to balance their scientific sensibilities with the informal tone associated with tweetorials. We discuss the implications of using informal and subjective language in science communication, as well as how technology can support scientists in writing tweetorials.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present an account of how FARC-EP ex-combatants are using digital technology in the process of reincorporating into Colombian society. We report findings showing how this technology mediates the difficult task of transitioning from a culture of opposition to civilian members and active political actors. Using the concept of \"social capital\" as a framework, we investigate the intersection between the use of digital tools and developing cultural and economic practices among these groups during this transitional period. Reflecting on the \"bonding\" and \"bridging\" aspects of social capital, we describe how ex-combatants draw on substantial social capital from their former lives as a guerrilla army in order to strengthen their position in these new circumstances, and their cautious and difficult creation of new social ties with wider Colombian society. We contribute to the CSCW discourse by discussing the crucial role digital tools, previously not available to these groups, play in sustaining, re-growing and building social capital of communities in post-conflict periods.

      "abstract": " Data is a crucial component of machine learning; the field is reliant on data to train, validate, and test models. With increased technical capabilities, machine learning research has boomed in both academic and industry settings—and one major focus has been on computer vision. Computer vision is a popular domain of machine learning increasingly pertinent to real world applications, from facial recognition in policing to object detection for autonomous vehicles. Given computer vision’s propensity to shape machine learning research and impact human life, we seek to understand disciplinary practices around dataset documentation—how data is collected, curated, annotated, and packaged into datasets for computer vision researchers and practitioners to use for model tuning and development. Specifically, we examine what dataset documentation communicates about the underlying values of vision data and the larger practices and goals of computer vision as a field. To conduct this study, we collect a corpus of about 500 computer vision datasets, from which we sampled 114 dataset publications across different vision tasks. Through both a structured and thematic content analysis, we document a number of values around accepted data practices, what makes desirable data, and the treatment of humans in the dataset construction process. We discuss how computer vision datasets authors value efficiency at the expense of care; universality at the expense of contextuality; impartiality at the expense of positionality; and model work at the expense of data work. Many of the silenced values we identify sit in opposition with social computing practices. We conclude with suggestions on how to better incorporate silenced values into the dataset creation and curation process.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we explore how sociotechnical systems support and impede the identity performances and identity expression of communities that have experienced a long history of colonialism, where colonization is the practice through which a foreign power reshapes the social structures and systems of other societies. We conducted a trace ethnography among members of a specific digital platform—Bengali Quora (BnQuora). BnQuora is part of the question and answer (Q&A) platform Quora, where people with this particular ethnolinguistic identity come together to engage in conversations about their identities; identities which were shaped through a long history of colonization in the Global South. In drawing on a conceptual framework that brings together identity performativity, governance, content moderation, and surveillance, we find that the sociotechnical mechanisms of governance that mediate people's performances on the BnQuora platform give rise to a kind of platform identity—certain identities are privileged while others are pushed to the margins based on linguistic practices, nationalities, and religious affiliations. We illustrate this through the themes of moderators as prison guards, collective surveillance as enforcing a majority identity, algorithmic coloniality, and staging as self-imprisonment. Finally, we discuss the ways in which governance shapes a platform's identity and can create, strengthen, and reinforce coloniality.",

In this paper, we focus on Mixed-Ability workplaces: work settings in which people without disabilities and with different types of disabilities collaborate on a daily basis. The case study for our exploratory research is a university library that has been able to support a mixed-ability work setting for over four years. We describe how a theory from cognitive linguistics (Conceptual Metaphor Theory) can be used to explore the challenges that people encounter in mixed-ability workplaces, identify the cognitive processes that differ between neurotypical team leaders and workers with cognitive disabilities, and translate these findings into design recommendations for embodied technologies that support mixed-ability workplaces.",

      "abstract": "Surveys are a common instrument to gauge self-reported opinions from the crowd for scholars in the CSCW community, the social sciences, and many other research areas. Researchers often use surveys to prioritize a subset of given options when there are resource constraints. Over the past century, researchers have developed a wide range of surveying techniques, including one of the most popular instruments, the Likert ordinal scale, to elicit individual preferences. However, the challenge to elicit accurate and rich self-reported responses with surveys in a resource-constrained context still persists today. In this study, we examine Quadratic Voting (QV), a voting mechanism powered by the affordances of a modern computer and straddles ratings and rankings approaches, as an alternative online survey technique. We argue that QV could elicit more accurate self-reported responses compared to the Likert scale when the goal is to understand relative preferences under resource constraints. We conducted two randomized controlled experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk, one in the context of public opinion polling and the other in a human-computer interaction user study. Based on our Bayesian analysis results, a QV survey with a sufficient amount of voice credits, aligned significantly closer to participants' incentive-compatible behaviors than a Likert scale survey, with a medium to high effect size. In addition, we extended QV's application scenario from typical public policy and education research to a problem setting familiar to the CSCW community: a prototypical HCI user study. Our experiment results, QV survey design, and QV interface serve as a stepping stone for CSCW researchers to further explore this surveying methodology in their studies and encourage decision-makers from other communities to consider QV as a promising alternative.",

      "abstract": "Data scientists often collaborate with clients to analyze data to meet a client’s needs. What does the end-to-end workflow of a data scientist’s collaboration with clients look like throughout the lifetime of a project? To investigate this question, we interviewed ten data scientists (5 female, 4 male, 1 non-binary) in diverse roles across industry and academia. We discovered that they work with clients in a six-stage outer-loop workflow, which involves 1) laying groundwork by building trust before a project begins, 2) orienting to the constraints of the client’s environment, 3) collaboratively framing the problem, 4) bridging the gap between data science and domain expertise, 5) the inner loop of technical data analysis work, 6) counseling to help clients emotionally cope with analysis results. This novel outer-loop workflow contributes to CSCW by expanding the notion of what collaboration means in data science beyond the widely-known inner-loop technical workflow stages of acquiring, cleaning, analyzing, modeling, and visualizing data. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for data science education, parallels to design work, and unmet needs for tool development.",

First, we developed a web prototype allowing users to apply different virtual backgrounds to their camera views. We then asked users to select backgrounds that they believed would change viewers’ perceptions of their personality traits. We applied a subset of the virtual backgrounds participants selected to a subset of videos from the First Impression Dataset. We then ran an online study on Amazon MTurk to compare participants’ personality trait ratings for subjects in three conditions: with the selected virtual backgrounds, with a gray screen instead of a background, and with the original video backgrounds. The selected virtual backgrounds did not change the personality trait ratings in the intended direction. Instead, virtual background use of any kind results in a consistent “muting effect” that mitigates very high or low ratings compared to the original background.",

Prior work identified these patterns in websites and mobile apps, but little is known about how the design of platforms might impact dark pattern manifestations and related human vulnerabilities. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study of mobile application, mobile browser, and web browser versions of 105 popular services to investigate variations in dark patterns across modalities. We perform manual tests, identify dark patterns in each service, and examine how they persist or differ by modality. Our findings show that while services can employ some dark patterns equally across modalities, many dark patterns vary between platforms, and that these differences saddle people with inconsistent experiences of autonomy, privacy, and control. We conclude by discussing broader implications for policymakers and practitioners, and provide suggestions for furthering dark patterns research.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have highlighted a range of potential benefits of teletherapy for clients. Nonetheless, researchers have found that many therapists are reluctant to adopt teletherapy in their work practice. There is a dearth of research about how therapists have appropriated telehealth platforms, either to understand teletherapy practice or to understand the challenges and opportunities for system design. The COVID-19 pandemic offers an unfortunate but unique opportunity to learn more about the experiences of therapists who use a range of therapeutic interventions with a range of client populations. In this work, we explore the following research question: in what ways do telehealth platforms support and challenge the work of teletherapy? We present results of semi-structured interviews conducted with 14 mental health therapists during the first six months of the pandemic in the United States. We present a descriptive account of their experiences as well as a discussion of the ways in which the multi-layered and interdependent nature of two facets of therapeutic work---the therapeutic alliance and the therapeutic interventions---made the transition to computer-supported cooperative work particularly challenging. We then offer a suite of design implications for systems that better support the nuanced and unique work of teletherapy.",

      "abstract": "Negative attitudes shape experiences with stigmatized conditions such as dementia, from affecting social relationships to influencing willingness to adopt technology. Consequently, attitudinal change has been identified as one lever to improve life for people with stigmatized conditions. Though recognized as a scaleable approach, social media has not been studied in terms of how it should best be designed or deployed to target attitudes and understanding of dementia. Through a mixed methods design with 123 undergraduate college students, we study the effect of being exposed to dementia-related media, including content produced by people with dementia. We selected undergraduate college students as the target of our intervention, as they represent the next generation that will work and interact with individuals with dementia. Our analysis describes changes over the period of two weeks in attitudes and understanding of the condition. The shifts in understanding of dementia that we found in our qualitative analysis were not captured by the instrument we selected to assess understanding of dementia. While small improvements in positive and overall attitudes were seen across all interventions and the control, we observe a different pattern with negative attitudes, where transcriptions of content produced by people with dementia significantly reduced negative attitudes. The discussion presents implications for supporting people with dementia as content producers, doing so in ways that best affect attitudes and understanding by drawing on research on cues and interactive media, and supporting students in changing their perspectives towards people with dementia.

      "abstract": "As algorithmic risk assessment instruments (RAIs) are increasingly adopted to assist decision makers, their predictive performance and properties vis-a-vis fairness have come under scrutiny. However, while most studies examine these tools in isolation, researchers have come to recognize that assessing their impact requires understanding the behavior of their human interactants. In this paper, building off of recent crowdsourcing studies focusing on criminal justice, we conduct a vignette study in which laypersons are tasked with predicting future re-arrests. Our key findings are as follows: (1) Participants often predict that an offender will be rearrested even when they deem the likelihood of re-arrest to be well below 50%; (2) Participants do not anchor on the RAI's predictions; (3) The time spent on the survey varies widely across participants and most cases are assessed in less than 10 seconds; (4) Judicial decisions, unlike participants' predictions, depend in part on factors that are orthogonal to the likelihood of recidivism. These results highlight the influence of several crucial but often overlooked design decisions and concerns around generalizability when constructing crowdsourcing studies to analyze the impacts of RAIs.",

Historically, women of color, particularly those with marginalized religious identities, have more challenges in securing employment. We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with Muslim-American women of color who had used online job platforms in the past two years to understand how they perceive digital hiring tools to be used in practice, how they navigate the US job market, and how hiring discrimination as a phenomenon is thought to relate to their intersecting social identities. Our findings allowed us to identify three major categories of asymmetries (i.e., the relationship between the computing algorithms' structures and their users' experiences): (1) process asymmetries, which is the lack of transparency in data collection processes of job applications; (2) information asymmetries, which refers to the asymmetry in data availability during online job-seeking; and (3) legacy asymmetries, which explains the cultural and historical factors impacting marginalized job applicants. We discuss design implications to support job seekers in identifying and securing positive employment outcomes.",

However, it is unclear how stairlifts are experienced by all household members and what this understanding implies for home healthcare technologies. We investigated the impact of stairlift installations on older adults' households through a qualitative study investigating the lived experience of the adoption and acceptance of this technology. Interviews and focus groups with primary users, household residents and service providers showed how the wider household identify misalignments between simplified stairlift installation models from service providers and describe a more complex, nuanced emotional journey which involves decision making, conflict and trauma and catharsis and independence.

      "abstract": "Real-time captioning is a critical accessibility tool for many d/Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) people. While the vast majority of captioning work has focused on formal settings and technical innovations, in contrast, we investigate captioning for informal, interactive small-group conversations, which have a high degree of spontaneity and foster dynamic social interactions. This paper reports on semi-structured interviews and design probe activities we conducted with 15 DHH participants to understand their use of existing real-time captioning services and future design preferences for both in-person and remote small-group communication. We found that our participants’ experiences of captioned small-group conversations are shaped by social, environmental, and technical considerations (e.g., interlocutors’ pre-established relationships, the type of captioning displays available, and how far captions lag behind speech). When considering future captioning tools, participants were interested in greater feedback on non-speech elements of conversation (e.g., speaker identity, speech rate, volume) both for their personal use and to guide hearing interlocutors towards more accessible communication. We contribute a qualitative account of DHH people’s real-time captioning experiences during small-group conversation and future design considerations to better support the groups being captioned, both in person and online.

      "abstract": "This paper examines the causes and consequences of legibility as an organizing principle in the design of digital agriculture (DA) systems in the United States. Legibility refers to systems of governance that use simplified understandings of a situation to control and direct action upon it. Legibility in digital agriculture systems occurs at the confluence of two traditions of legibility: the data-driven model common in the design of digital systems, and tactics for the control of nature and labor that have developed in the United States since the foundation of the colonies. Our argument draws from (1) a historical analysis of broader patterns of agricultural technology and racialized land dispossession in what is now the United States and (2) empirical fieldwork that examines the adoption and maintenance of digital agriculture systems in rural New York State. We describe the role that legibility historically has played in the development of agricultural systems in the US, and their consequences for who is able to farm and how.  This history raises the questions: What is made legible to whom? In that process, what becomes illegible? While legibility promises transparent and environmentally beneficial control, in our fieldwork we find that the demands of legibility are also restructuring the physical landscape, creating additional invisible labor, producing systems that are brittle to real-world conditions on farms, and creating opaque systems that block people from adapting to their circumstances. In reading our fieldwork together with the historical case, we demonstrate the pressures that are shaping the stakes, subject, and objects of legibility in agricultural technology.  As more data-driven systems are used for environmental contexts, the CSCW community needs to extend its ways to understand how data-driven systems impact land, labor, and resources.  ",

      "abstract": "Algorithms have permeated throughout civil government and society, where they are being used to make high-stakes decisions about human lives. In this paper, we first develop a cohesive framework of algorithmic decision-making adapted for the public sector (ADMAPS) that reflects the complex socio-technical interactions between human discretion, bureaucratic processes, and algorithmic decision-making by synthesizing disparate bodies of work in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Science and Technology Studies (STS), and Public Administration (PA). We then applied the ADMAPS framework to conduct a qualitative analysis of an in-depth, eight-month ethnographic case study of the algorithms in daily use within a child-welfare agency that serves approximately 900 families and 1300 children in the mid-western United States. Overall, we found there is a need to focus on strength-based algorithmic outcomes centered in social ecological frameworks. In addition, algorithmic systems need to support existing bureaucratic processes and augment human discretion, rather than replace it.  Finally, collective buy-in in algorithmic systems requires trust in the target outcomes at both the practitioner and bureaucratic levels. As a result of our study, we propose guidelines for the design of high-stakes algorithmic decision-making tools in the child-welfare system, and more generally, in the public sector. We empirically validate the theoretically derived ADMAPS framework to demonstrate how it can be useful for systematically making pragmatic decisions about the design of algorithms for the public sector.

      "abstract": "Open source communities hosted in large foundations operate in a complex socio-technical ecosystem, which includes a heterogeneous mix of projects and stakeholders. Previous work has thus far investigated the challenges faced in OSS communities from the point of view of specific stakeholders, primarily at the level of individual projects. None have yet studied the challenges faced within a large, federated open source organization. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap to identify ongoing challenges contributors face in a mature OSS organization. To do so, we surveyed 624 contributors at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and ran 11 semi-structured follow up interviews. We validated our findings through member checking with the interviewees as well as the ASF Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) committee. The contributions of this paper include: (1) an empirically-evidenced conceptual model of the 88 challenges that contributors face in a mature OSS foundation and (2) a set of 48 community-recommended strategies for alleviating these challenges. Our results show that even well-established and mature organizations still face a variety of individual and project-specific challenges and that it is difficult to design a comprehensive set of processes and guidelines to match the needs and expectations of a diverse and large federated community. Our conceptual challenges model and associated strategies to mitigate them can provide guidance to other OSS foundations and projects helping them in building better support processes and tools to create a successful, thriving community of contributors.",

      "abstract": "Collaborative editing questions and answers plays an important role in quality control of Mathematics Stack Exchange which is a math Q&A Site. Our study of post edits in Mathematics Stack Exchange shows that there is a large number of math-related edits about latexifying formulas, revising LaTeX and converting the blurred math formula screenshots to LaTeX sequence. Despite its importance, manually editing one math-related post especially those with complex mathematical formulas is time-consuming and error-prone even for experienced users. To assist post owners and editors to do this editing, we have developed an edit-assistance tool, MathLatexEdit for formula latexification, LaTeX revision and screenshot transcription. We formulate this formula editing task as a translation problem, in which an original post is translated to a revised post. MathLatexEdit implements a deep learning based approach including two encoder-decoder models for textual and visual LaTeX edit recommendation with math-specific inference. The two models are trained on large-scale historical original-edited post pairs and synthesized screenshot-formula pairs. Our evaluation of MathLatexEdit not only demonstrates the accuracy of our model, but also the usefulness of MathLatexEdit in editing real-world posts which are accepted in Mathematics Stack Exchange.",

      "abstract": "Social media provides the means by which extremist social movements, such as white supremacy and anti-LGBTQ, thrive online. Yet, we know little about the roles played by the participants of such movements. In this paper, we investigate these participants to characterize their roles, their role dynamics, and their influence in spreading online extremism. Our participants—online extremist accounts—are 4,876 public Facebook pages or groups that have shared information from the websites of 289 Southern Poverty LawCenter (SPLC) designated extremist groups. Guided by theories of participatory activism, we map the information sharing features of these extremists accounts. By clustering the quantitative features followed by qualitative expert validation, we identify five roles surrounding extremist activism—educators, solicitors, flamers, motivators, sympathizers. For example, solicitors use links from extremist websites to attract donations and participation in extremist issues, whereas flamers share inflammatory extremist content inciting anger. We further investigate role dynamics such as, how stable these roles are over time and how likely will extremist accounts transition from one role into another. We find that roles core to the movement—educators and solicitors—are more stable, while flamers and motivators can transition to sympathizers with high probability. Finally, using a Hawkes process model, we test which roles are more influential in spreading various types of information. We find that educators and solicitors exert the most influence in triggering extremist link posts, whereas flamers are influential in triggering the spread of information from fake news sources. Our results help in situating various roles on the trajectory of deeper engagement into the extremist movements and understanding the potential effect of various counter-extremism interventions. Our findings have implications for understanding how online extremist movements flourish through participatory activism and how they gain a spectrum of allies for mobilizing extremism online.",

      "abstract": "The Negro Motorist Green Book was a tool used by the Black community to navigate systemic racism throughout the U.S. and around the world.  Whether providing its users with safer roads to take or businesses that were welcoming to Black patrons, The Negro Motorist Green Book fostered pride and created a physical network of safe spaces within the Black community. Building a bridge between this artifact which served Black people for thirty years and the current moment, we explore Black Twitter as an online space where the Black community navigates identity, activism, racism, and more.  Through interviews with people who engage with Black Twitter, we surface the benefits (such as community building, empowerment, and activism) and challenges (like dealing with racism, appropriation, and outsiders) on the platform, juxtaposing the Green Book as a historical artifact and Black Twitter as its contemporary counterpart.  Equipped with these insights, we make suggestions including audience segmentation, privacy controls, and involving historically disenfranchised perspectives into the technological design process. These proposals have implications for the design of technologies that would serve Black communities by amplifying Black voices and bolstering work toward justice.",

In such a class, however, learners must explicitly act beyond their normal learning activities, so often there is no social presence in the class even when there are several learners working on the same course material.\r\nIn this paper, we develop an approach where learners can share the social presence without any explicit action; their normal learning activities would be used to provide visual cues for social presence.\r\nWe present Cocode, a system designed for an online programming class that shows other learners' code editors and running output in the programming environment with minimum privacy issues. \r\nFor evaluation, we ran two user studies with groups of participants who took an offline class and an online programming class from the university; results from the studies showed that learners felt less social presence in Cocode than in offline classes, but they felt significantly more social presence in Cocode than in online classes with live video lectures, forums, and chat sessions.

      "abstract": "Design and co-creation activities around 3D artifacts often require close collocated coordination between multiple users. Augmented reality (AR) technology can support collocated work enabling users to flexibly work with digital objects while still being able to use the physical space for coordination. With most of current research focusing on remote AR collaboration, less is known about collocated collaboration in AR, particularly in relation to interpersonal dynamics between the collocated collaborators. Our study aims at understanding how shared augmented reality facilitated by mobile devices (mobile augmented reality or MAR) affects collocated users' coordination. We compare the coordination behaviors that emerged in a MAR setting with those in a comparable fully physical setting by simulating the same task – co-creation of a 3D artifact. Our results demonstrate the importance of the shared physical dimension for participants' ability to coordinate in the context of collaborative co-creation. Namely, participants working in a fully physical setting were better able to leverage the work artifact itself for their coordination needs, working in a mode that we term artifact-oriented coordination. Conversely, participants collaborating around an AR artifact leveraged the shared physical workspace for their coordination needs, working in what we refer to as space-oriented coordination. We discuss implications for a AR-based collaboration and propose directions for designers of AR tools.",

      "abstract": "Peer evaluations are critical for assessing teams, but are susceptible to bias and other factors that undermine their reliability. At the same time, collaborative tools that teams commonly use to perform their work are increasingly capable of logging activity that can signal useful information about individual contributions and teamwork.\r\nTo investigate current and potential uses for activity traces in peer evaluation tools, we interviewed (N=11) and surveyed (N=242) students and interviewed (N=10) instructors at a single university. We found that nearly all of the students surveyed considered specific contributions to the team outcomes when evaluating their teammates, but also reported relying on memory and subjective experiences to make the assessment. Instructors desired objective sources of data to address challenges with administering and interpreting peer evaluations, and have already begun incorporating activity traces from collaborative tools into their evaluations of teams. However, both students and instructors expressed concern about using activity traces due to the diverse ecosystem of tools and platforms used by teams and the limited view into the context of the contributions. Based on our findings, we contribute recommendations and a speculative design for a data-centric peer evaluation tool.",

      "abstract": "Crowdsourcing markets provide workers with a centralized place to find paid work. What may not be obvious at first glance is that, in addition to the work they do for pay, crowd workers also have to shoulder a variety of unpaid invisible labor in these markets, which ultimately reduces workers' hourly wages. Invisible labor includes finding good tasks, messaging requesters, or managing payments. However, we currently know little about how much time crowd workers actually spend on invisible labor or how much it costs them economically. To ensure a fair and equitable future for crowdsourcing, we need to be certain that workers are being paid fairly for all of the work they do. In this paper, we conduct a field study to quantify the invisible labor in crowd work.  We build a plugin to record the amount of time that 100 workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk dedicate to invisible labor while completing 40,903 HITs. If we ignore the time workers spent on invisible labor, workers' median hourly wage was $3.76.  \r\nBut, we estimated that crowd workers in our study spent 33% of their time daily on invisible labor, dropping their median hourly wage to $2.83. We found that the invisible labor differentially impacts workers depending on their skill level (master workers did 23% less invisible labor) and workers' demographics. The invisible labor category that took the most time and that was also the most common revolved around workers having to manage their payments. The second most  time-consuming invisible labor category involved hyper-vigilance, where workers vigilantly watched over requesters' profiles for newly posted work and vigilantly searched for labor. We hope that through our paper, the invisible labor in crowdsourcing becomes more visible, and our results help to reveal the larger implications of the continuing invisibility of labor in crowdsourcing.\r\n",

We describe challenges to scaling data science collaborations and present a conceptual framework and ML programming model to address them. We instantiate these ideas in Ballet, a lightweight framework for collaborative, open-source data science through a focus on feature engineering, and an accompanying cloud-based development environment. Using our framework, collaborators incrementally propose feature definitions to a repository which are each subjected to an ML performance evaluation and can be automatically merged into an executable feature engineering pipeline. We leverage Ballet to conduct a case study analysis of an income prediction problem with 27 collaborators, and discuss implications for future designers of collaborative projects.",

      "abstract": "Traditional meetings involve extensive sitting, which negatively impacts the health of attendees. Understanding how technology can facilitate integrating physical activity into the workplace, such as in walking meetings, is vital to improving workplace wellbeing. To that end, we applied a mixed-method approach to explore requirements and opportunities for walking meetings. We conducted an online questionnaire and a series of interviews with early adopters of walking meetings and created design fictions based on their feedback. We evaluated the design fictions with a second questionnaire and garnered additional feedback from the original early adopters. Based on our findings, we derived four dimensions associated with walking meetings: practical, environmental, social, and cognitive facets. We define attributes, challenges, and opportunities within these dimensions which are important for designing systems that support walking meetings. Our work identifies key considerations for developing systems that integrate physical activity into communication activities.",

      "abstract": "The goal of this study was to examine the work practices of behavioral health professionals with a view towards designing interactive systems to support their work. We conducted a qualitative workplace study, including in situ observations and semi-structured interviews, in a multidisciplinary clinic treating pediatric feeding disorders. This paper contributes a detailed characterization of clinicians' work practices and conducts a comparative analysis of three types of work: treatment, record management, and preparation work. We found that clinicians have a preference for taxing over tedious work. For example, they experience real-time data collection as more taxing but less tedious than retroactive data entry. Design efforts should balance the tension between addressing the taxing (data collection during meals) versus the tedious (manually entering data into spreadsheets). Although addressing the taxing improves within-routine efficiency, addressing the tedious improves overall morale. Further, we hypothesize that there is a rewarding or unrewarding quality to work that is dictated in part by its social, temporal, and clinical characteristics. We discuss conceptual and design implications for supporting clinical work, and highlight considerations unique to behavioral health.",

      "abstract": "The spread of AI-embedded systems involved in human decision making makes studying human trust in these systems critical. However, empirically investigating trust is challenging. One reason is the lack of standard protocols to design trust experiments. In this paper, we present a survey of existing methods to empirically investigate trust in AI-assisted decision making and analyse the corpus along the constitutive elements of an experimental protocol. We find that the defintion fo trust is not commonly integrated in the experimental protocols, which can lead to findings that are overclaimed or are hard to interpret and compare across studies. Drawing from empirical practices in social and cognitive studies on human-human trust, we provide practical guidelines to improve the methodology of studying Human-AI trust in decision-making contexts. In addition, we bring forward research opportunities of two types: one focusing on further investigation regarding trust methodologies and the other on factors that impact Human-AI trust.",

Hence the sharing and utilisation of mobile health data, for example to help control the spread of communicable diseases, has become a relevant issue, with the COVID-19 pandemic adding a sudden urgency mirrored in debates around contact tracing apps. Building on exploratory work that indicated user perceptions and values around consent, and the notion that smartphones and mobile health data can be perceived as elements of self-embodiment, we present an online study comparing three scenarios of representative diseases undertaken during the first wave lockdown in the UK. Using a mixed-methods analysis of responses from 86 participants, we identify tensions and mitigations in user values and from those present the description of four characteristic user-groups that can inform considerations for design and development activities in this space.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Online discussion platforms offer a forum to strengthen and propagate belief in misinformed conspiracy theories. Yet, they also offer avenues for conspiracy theorists to express their doubts and experiences of cognitive dissonance. Such expressions of dissonance may shed light on who abandons misguided beliefs and under which circumstances. This paper characterizes self-disclosures of dissonance about QAnon—a conspiracy theory initiated by a mysterious leader “Q” and popularized by their followers “anons”—in conspiracy theory subreddits. To understand what dissonance and disbelief mean within conspiracy communities, we first characterize their social imaginaries—a broad understanding of how people collectively imagine their social existence. Focusing on 2K posts from two image boards, 4chan and 8chan, and 1.2 M comments and posts from 12 subreddits dedicated to QAnon, we adopt a mixed-methods approach to uncover the symbolic language representing the movement, expectations, practices, heroes and foes of the QAnon community. We use these social imaginaries to create a computational framework for distinguishing belief and dissonance from general discussion about QAnon, surfacing in the 1.2M comments. We investigate the dissonant comments to typify the dissonance expressed along QAnon social imaginaries. Further, analyzing user engagement with QAnon conspiracy subreddits, we find that self-disclosures of dissonance correlate with a significant decrease in user contributions and ultimately with their departure from the community. Our work offers a systematic framework for uncovering the dimensions and coded language related to QAnon social imaginaries and can serve as a toolbox for studying other conspiracy theories across different platforms. We also contribute a computational framework for identifying dissonance self-disclosures and measuring the changes in user engagement surrounding dissonance. Our work can provide insights into designing dissonance-based interventions that can potentially dissuade conspiracists from online conspiracy discussion communities.",

In this paper we report on a three year-long project, involving refugees, migrants and activist supporters in a co-design project to develop tools that aid the process of resettling. Several aspects have challenged equal participation in the project, including divergent motives, unequal power distribution and cultural heterogeneity. Despite these challenges the project outcomes are in use and maintained beyond the project runtime through voluntary actors. We reflect on this discrepancy between process and outcome drawing on the concept of care.",

      "abstract": "While philosophers hold that it is patently absurd to blame robots or hold them morally responsible (e.g. Sparrow, 2007), a series of recent empirical studies suggest that people do ascribe blame to AI systems and robots in certain contexts (e.g. Malle et al. 2016). This is disconcerting: Blame might be shifted from owners, users or designers of AI systems to the systems themselves, leading to the diminished accountability of the responsible human agents (Kneer & Stuart, 2021). In this paper, we explore one of the potential underlying reasons for robot blame, namely the folk’s willingness to ascribe inculpating mental states or “mens rea” to robots. In a vignette-based experiment (N=513), we presented participants with a situation in which an agent knowingly runs the risk of bringing about substantial harm. We manipulated agent type (human v. group agent v. AI-driven robot) and outcome (neutral v. bad), and measured both moral judgment (wrongness of the action and blameworthiness of the agent) and mental states attributed to the agent (recklessness and the desire to inflict harm). We found that (i) judgments of wrongness and blame were relatively similar across agent types, possibly because (ii) judgments of attributed mental states were, as suspected, similar across agent types.  This raised the question – also explored in the experiment – whether people attribute knowledge and desire to robots in a metaphorical way (e.g. the robot “knew” rather than actually knew). However, (iii), according to our data people were unwilling to downgrade to mens rea in a merely metaphorical sense. Finally, (iv), we report a surprising and novel finding, which we call the inverse outcome effect on robot blame: People were less willing to blame artificial agents for bad outcomes than for neutral outcomes. This suggests that they are implicitly aware of the dangers of overattributing blame to robots when harm comes to pass, which might lead to inappropriately letting the responsible human agent off the moral hook.

      "abstract": "People supported by AI-powered decision support tools frequently overrely on the AI: they accept an AI's suggestion even when that suggestion is wrong. Adding explanations to the AI decisions does not appear to reduce the overreliance and some studies suggest that it might even increase it.\r\nInformed by the dual-process theory of cognition, we posit that people rarely engage analytically with each individual AI recommendation and explanation, and instead develop general heuristics about whether and when to follow the AI suggestions. Building on prior research on medical decision-making, we designed three cognitive forcing interventions to compel people to engage more thoughtfully with the AI-generated explanations.\r\nWe conducted an experiment (N=199), in which we compared our three cognitive forcing designs, to two simple explainable AI approaches, and to a no-AI baseline. The results demonstrate that cognitive forcing significantly reduced overreliance compared to the simple explainable AI approaches. However, there was a trade-off: people assigned the least favorable subjective ratings to the designs that reduced the overreliance the most. To audit our work for intervention-generated inequalities, we investigated whether our interventions benefited equally people with different levels of Need for Cognition (i.e., motivation to engage in effortful mental activities). Our results show that, on average, cognitive forcing interventions benefited participants higher in Need for Cognition more.\r\nOur research suggests that human cognitive motivation moderates the effectiveness of explainable AI solutions.",

      "abstract": "The struggle to thrive as a productive student researcher, an attentive parent, and a caring partner can be difficult, particularly for international student parents who are far from home and also possibly burdened with complex cultural expectations, interpersonal dynamics, and institutional biases. Using uses and gratifications theory as a framing mechanism, we describe interviews with twelve international student mothers in the United States who are primary caregivers of children between six months to five years old, focusing on the context of their use of screen media content and devices, the gratifications they seek from their children's use of screen media devices, and the differences in their perceptions about the use of screen media as an educated, non-US parent. Our findings give an initial account of the role of screen based technology in their domestic life with young children, and the limitations of their technological experience. We present four opportunities for designing for this population including technologies for positive distraction, interactive language aids, playful acquaintance tools, and anonymous peer networks for parent support. We conclude by formulating future promising avenues of research in this design space. ",

      "abstract": "The opportunity for online engagement increases possible exposure to potentially risky behaviors for teens, which may have significant negative consequences. Effective family communication about online safety can help reduce the risky adolescent behavior and limit the consequences after it occurs. Our paper contributes a theory of communication factors that positively influence teen and parent perception of communication about online safety and provides design implications based on those findings. While previous work identified gaps in family communication regarding online safety, our study quantitatively identified the factors that significantly contribute to parents’ and teens’ differing perceptions. We analyzed data from a survey of 215 teen-parent pairs through a cross-sectional design and examined the factors that contribute to increased family communication about online safety. For parents, active mediation, technical monitoring, and a perceived positive affect of the teen were associated with higher levels of family communication. Our results were similar for teens, except that the teen’s online safety concern and parental monitoring were also positively associated with increased family communication, while restrictive mediation was associated with lower levels of family communication. Many existing designs for online safety support a restrictive approach, despite teens not wanting technical restrictions. A key implication of our findings is that teens view active mediation and monitoring positively in respect to family communication. Contrary to mainstream narratives, this finding suggests that teens value parental involvement and do not desire complete independence online. By examining specific mechanisms which can hinder or improve family communication between parents and teens regarding online safety, we recommend solutions that give teens an active role in their online safety and facilitate effective family communication through cooperation between both parties, rather than technologies that promote parental restriction.",

To help NNS resolve potential confusions due to unfamiliar language use without risking face concerns, we created a conversation agent that asked clarification questions intended to help NNS follow and participate in multiparty conversations. We conducted a within-subjects laboratory experiment with 17 triads of 2 NS and 1 NNS, who performed a series of collaborative tasks under three conditions: a) no agent, b) a high-level agent that resembles a NNS with good command of English, and c) a low-level agent that resembles a NNS with poor English skills. Results suggest that NS made significantly more clarifications in both agent conditions than without an agent. In the high-level agent condition, NNS reported an increase in understanding after the agent’s interruption and spoke significantly more. Further, NNS evaluated their communication competence in English highest in the low-level agent condition and lowest in the control condition. Our findings suggest several directions to improve the tool to better facilitate multilingual multiparty communication.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic upended the lives of families with young children as school closures and social distancing requirements left caregivers struggling to facilitate educational experiences, maintain social connections, and ensure financial stability. Considering families’ increased reliance on technology to survive, this research documents parents’ lived experiences adapting to technology’s outsized role alongside other shifts in family life associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we describe a 10-week study with 30 enrolled families with children aged 3 to 13 in the United States using the asynchronous remote communities (ARC) methodology to 1) understand the benefits and challenges faced by families as they adapted technology at home to navigate the pandemic, and 2) to ideate improvements to those experiences through co-design. We found that amidst gaps in infrastructural support from schools, workplaces, and communities, parents experienced deep anxiety and took on new roles, including tech support, school administrator, and curator of meaningful activities for their children. As parents shared bold and creative technology-based solutions for improving family well-being, schooling experiences, social life, and beyond, they demonstrated their capacity to contribute to new models of learning and family life. Our findings are a call to action for CSCW researchers, designers, and family-focused practitioners to work with learning communities that incorporate parent, teacher, and technology experiences in their academic and community planning.

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic led to dire consequences globally, and it has been particularly challenging for older adults. They are at a higher risk of adverse outcomes of the disease. Older adults also use less technology than other age groups, so they mostly rely on in-person interactions and services for social support. However, disease mitigation efforts such as social distancing and self-quarantining severely limited in-person interactions, hindering older adults’ social support during the COVID-19 crisis. In this paper, we present findings on social support realities from semi-structured interviews with older adults (N=15) living alone in community dwellings. We found that older adults’ support roles, support sources, and support concerns evolve as they passed through this time of sweeping change. They are enthusiastic about providing support to people who are older and more vulnerable than themselves. At the same time, their needs for safety, autonomy, and independence create tensions around social support. We propose a framework to illustrate the evolving ecology of social support that can facilitate the holistic design of socio-technical support systems for older adults. We argue against the societal portrayal of older adults as vulnerable individuals. Rather, there is an opportunity to design support systems considering them as anchors in society. Towards that goal, we present design implications for future socio-technical support systems to empower older adults to age in place during a crisis.",

      "abstract": "Algorithms in online platforms interact with users' identities in different ways. However, little is known about how users understand the interplay between identity and algorithmic processes on these platforms, and if and how such understandings shape their behavior on these platforms in return. Through semi-structured interviews with 15 US-based TikTok users, we detail users' algorithmic folk theories of the For You Page algorithm in relation to two inter-connected identity types: person and social identity. Participants identified potential harms that can accompany algorithms' tailoring content to their person identities. Further, they believed the algorithm actively suppresses content related to marginalized social identities based on race and ethnicity, body size and physical appearance, ability status, class status, LGBTQ identity, and political and social justice group affiliation. We propose a new algorithmic folk theory of social feeds—The Identity Strainer Theory—to describe when users believe an algorithm filters out and suppresses certain social identities. In developing this theory, we introduce the concept of algorithmic privilege as held by users positioned to benefit from algorithms on the basis of their identities. We further propose the concept of algorithmic representational harm to refer to the harm users experience when they lack algorithmic privilege and are subjected to algorithmic symbolic annihilation. Additionally, we describe how participants changed their behaviors to shape their algorithmic identities to align with how they understood themselves, as well as to resist the suppression of marginalized social identities and lack of algorithmic privilege via individual actions, collective actions, and altering their performances. We theorize our findings to detail the ways the platform's algorithm and its users co-produce knowledge of identity on the platform. We argue the relationship between users’ algorithmic folk theories and identity are consequential for social media platforms, as it impacts users' experiences, behaviors, sense of belonging, and perceived ability to be seen, heard, and feel valued by others as mediated through algorithmic systems.",

      "abstract": "Working from home has become a mainstream work practice in many organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. While remote work has received much scholarly and public attention over the years, we still know little about how people with disabilities engage in remote work from their homes and what access means in this context. To understand and rethink accessibility in remote work, the present paper studies work-from-home practices of neurodivergent professionals who have Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, learning disabilities (e.g., dyslexia) and psychosocial disabilities (e.g., anxiety, depression). We report on interviews with 36 neurodivergent professionals who are working from home during the pandemic. Our findings reveal that while working from home, neurodivergent professionals create accessible physical and digital workspaces, negotiate accessible communication practices, and reconcile tensions between productivity and wellbeing. Our analysis reconsiders what access means in remote work for neurodivergent professionals and offers practical insights for inclusive work practices and accessibility improvements in remote collaboration tools.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an unexpected story about the outcomes of a civic project. CSCW and HCI scholarships have argued for a long-term perspective to assess civic projects and to understand how local communities appropriate – or maybe disregard – the material outcomes of such interventions. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how to interpret the outcomes of such projects, and how to make sense of their social impact on the wider contexts they are bound to. \r\nThis article draws on the notion of “political ecologies of participation“ to illustrate: \\textit{i)} how outcomes of socially-engaged projects circulate through communities and can be appropriated independently of the research inquiries they stem from; \\textit{ii)} how, through such process, impact is reconfigured as issues are added to shared concerns. The paper sets out by analyzing the entanglement of actors, meanings (e.g. values, narratives, opinions) and forms of participation that were configured throughout the transformation observed. Attention is then drawn to their political qualities, including their inherent openness and their capacity to produce change locally. The paper introduces four analytical sensitives illustrating how thinking with political ecologies of participation can help CSCW research to focus on the longer processes whereby impact can be configured.",

      "abstract": "Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs), from online chatbots to smart speakers, are increasingly being used to support children and family activities. This virtual workshop seeks to bring together researchers from academia and practitioners from industry who are interested in the design, development, application, and study of CUIs with a focus on children and family based interactions. We aim to examine the challenges involved in designing and developing CUIs that are capable of supporting everyday activities of children and families. Furthermore, we will also discuss the insights CSCW research can provide into understanding how CUIs can participate in collaborative activities of children and families. By bringing together existing researchers and new ideas in this space, we intend to map new areas of work including addressing the technical, social, and ethical challenges that lay ahead. Additionally, this work seeks to foster a strong community and enable potential future collaborations on this important topic.",

      "abstract": "Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) have long studied how technology can support material and relational aspects of care work, typically in clinical healthcare settings. More recently, we see increasing recognition of care work such as informal healthcare provision, child and elderly care, organizing and advocacy, domestic work, and service work. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored long-present tensions between the deep necessity and simultaneous devaluation of our care infrastructures. This highlights the need to attend to the broader social, political, and economic systems that shape care work and the emerging technologies being used in care work. This leads us to ask several critical questions: \\textit{What counts as care work and why? How is care work (de)valued, (un)supported, or coerced under capitalism and to what end? What narratives drive the push for technology in care work and whom does it benefit? How does care work resist or build resilience against and within oppressive systems? And how can we as researchers advocate for and with care and caregivers?} In this one-day workshop, we will bring together researchers from academia, industry, and community-based organizations to reflect on these questions and extend conversations on the future of technology for care work.",

Although OHCs are an active and exciting research area that continuously attracts a wide range of approaches and methodologies, the focus has been mostly on a limited selection of OHCs or medical conditions. At the same time, there are novel challenges that OHCs face, including changes to the medical system resulting from the COVID-19 crisis, increased medical misinformation propagating online, and additional focus on personalized medical advice that is less attainable in traditional medical systems. This workshop will bring together researchers to discuss and produce generalizable lessons about membership, structure, and support in OHCs in the context of these novel changes, generating research agendas for future exploration and design of OHCs.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Technologies in the workplace have been a major focus of CSCW, including studies that investigate technologies for collaborative work, explore new work environments, and address the importance of political and organizational aspects of technologies in workplaces. Emerging technologies, such as AI and robotics, have been deployed in various workplaces, and their proliferation is rapidly expanding. These technologies have not only changed the nature of work but also reinforced power and social dynamics within workplaces, requiring us to rethink the legitimate relationship between emerging technologies and human workers. It will be critical to the development of equitable future work arrangements to identify how these emerging technologies will develop relationships with human workers who have limited power and voice in their workplaces. How can these emerging technologies develop mutually beneficial partnerships with human workers? In this one-day workshop, we seek to illustrate the meaning of human-machine partnerships (HMP) by highlighting that how we define HMP may shape the design of future robots at work. By incorporating interdisciplinary perspectives, we aim to develop a taxonomy of HMP by which we can broaden our relationship with embodied agents but also evaluate and reconsider existing theoretical, methodological, and epistemological challenges in HMP research.",

Choosing who we cite is a practice signaling who we recognize and respect as a knowledge source. Therefore, we recognize citations as a relational practice. As this relational characteristic of citing is mediated by wealth we distribute across those who we cite, it is imperative to interrogate how just these practices are. We ought to engage with Citational Justice. Building on recent work discussing citational practices within HCI [9], we use the opportunity of this workshop to expand this conversation into deeper reflection on how we cite and the practices and infrastructures surrounding citations. Our goal with this workshop is two-fold. First, to create common language to collectively reflect, interrogate our own citational practices and reverberations, while fleshing out concrete steps to make these practices just in our work and communities we are part of. Second, to invite participants tore-imagine citational practices and the systems and infrastructures necessary to make such practices feasible. We invite a diverse group of participants from the CSCW community interested in examining their citational practices and the systems surrounding them.",

      "abstract": "This workshop explores socially expressive technology design using collaborative principles of theater, dance and music. Building on shared roots of making something together, technologies (including virtual agents, physical devices, storytelling multimedia) and artistic provocation can create playful, productive and healthy experiences for communities. How do we: Improve collaboration between performance art and creative technology? Design apps and artistic collaboration/learning for mental health? Use theater performativity and technology to enhance our lives? As smart devices become ubiquitous, yet solidarity and cooperation remain elusive in competitive/hierarchical societies, understanding how performance art and technology collaborate can improve how we work, play and care for our and each other’s health. This workshop is a forum and creative space to discuss and play with the future of performative expression and collaborative computing. We welcome researchers and practitioners from varied disciplines including technical implementation, design, theater, dance, improv, physiology and psychology. The program features collaborative creation modules across the expressive human spectrum (movement, sound, text) using digital dramaturgy (Budde, 2017) and pleasure of learning (Brecht, 2001). It also includes participants’ presentations, expert talks and videos exploring the expressive side of computing technology. Accepted applicants are invited to share perspectives and collaborate on creative exercises on art/artefacts/artificiality. ",

      "abstract": "The internet of things (IoT) and smart home technologies are pervasive in the U.S. and abroad. Devices like smart speakers, cameras, thermostats, and vacuums promise to save consumers time and energy and to make tasks easier. Many devices also provide significant benefits through accessibility features that offer hands-free options, voice commands, and management through smartphone apps. At the same time, however, researchers and the media have documented a number of vulnerabilities in these devices, which raises concerns about what and how much data is being collected, how that data is used, and who has access to the data. In this one-day workshop, participants will work together to brainstorm potential solutions for making smart device data more visible and interpretable for consumers. Through rotating breakout sessions and full-group discussions, participants will identify data-based threats in popular smart home technologies, select data flows that are most concerning, and generate design ideas for tools or other artifacts that can help consumers make more informed decisions about using these devices. Opportunities for networking and future collaborations will also be incorporated.",

      "abstract": "The goal of this one-day workshop is to begin building an active community of researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers who are jointly committed to leveraging human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) to make the internet a safer place for youth. This community will be founded on the principles of open innovation and human dignity to address some of the most salient safety issues of modern-day internet, including online harassment, sexual solicitation, and the mental health of vulnerable internet users, particularly adolescents and young adults. We will partner with Mozilla Research Foundation to launch a new open project named ``MOSafely.org,'' which will serve as a platform for code library, research, and data contributions that support the mission of internet safety. During the workshop, we will discuss: 1) the types of contributions and technical standards needed to advance the state-of-the art in online risk detection, 2) the practical, legal, and ethical challenges that we will face, and 3) ways in which we can overcome these challenges through the use of HCAI to create a sustainable community. An end goal of creating the MOSafely community is to offer evidence-based, customizable, robust, and low-cost solutions that are accessible to the public for the purpose of youth protection.",

      "abstract": "It is common practice for machine learning systems to rely on crowdsourced label data for training and evaluation. It is also well-known that biases present in the label data can induce biases in the trained models. Biases may be introduced by the mechanisms used for deciding what data should/could be labelled or by the mechanisms employed to obtain the labels. Various approaches have been proposed to detect and correct biases once the label dataset has been constructed. However, proactively reducing biases during the data labelling phase and ensuring data fairness could be more economical compared to post-processing bias mitigation approaches. In this workshop, we aim to foster discussion on ongoing research around biases in crowdsourced data and to identify future research directions to detect, quantify and mitigate biases before, during and after the labelling process such that both task requesters and crowd workers can benefit. We will explore how specific crowdsourcing workflows, worker attributes, and work practices contribute to biases in the labelled data; how to quantify and mitigate biases as part of the labelling process; and how such mitigation approaches may impact workers and the crowdsourcing ecosystem. The outcome of the workshop will include a collaborative publication of a research agenda to improve or develop novel methods relating to crowdsourcing tools, processes and work practices to address biases in crowdsourced data. We also plan to run a Crowd Bias Challenge prior to the workshop, where participants will be asked to collect labels for a given dataset while minimising potential biases.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been uniquely challenging for the Asian diaspora. The virus has directly devastated Asian communities around the world, most notably across India. Its indirect effects have also been crushing: violent hate crimes against elders, the dissolution of once-thriving businesses, and the trauma of pandemic-enforced disconnect from transnational family networks have all weighed heavily on Asian people. Publicly grappling with these difficulties, through hashtags and GoFundMes across social media, has raised awareness of the issues that Asian people have dealt with long before COVID. But doing so amidst isolation has illuminated a need for space to build relationships, confront intra- and inter-community biases, and envision a more hopeful future. This workshop looks to create that space. By convening social computing researchers with ties to Asian diaspora identities, we aim to foster discussion of how social platforms enable identity formation and online activism unique to the Asian diasporic experience. We will consider what it means to be an Asian diaspora researcher, challenge CSCW’s notion of what it means to be Asian, and explore how Asianness can work in alliance with other marginalized identities to ultimately concretize a research agenda for CSCW to more meaningfully engage with Asian diaspora experiences.",

      "abstract": "Research across political science, communications, sociology, and human-computer interaction has explored how modern social movements are leveraging current social technologies and social platforms to mobilize for social change. While mass mobilization has influenced policy, triggered revolutions, and influenced cultures globally, mobilization is just one method of collective action. In contrast, the more structured, relationship-focused practice of community organizing can also enable mass societal change, such as the US Civil Rights movement and the development of tech-giant labor unions. While there is exploration into how we might research and design tools informed by organizing, there is little exploration into how specific frameworks and practices of community organizing such as the People, Power, Change framework might evolve or are currently evolving in response to the ever changing landscape of technology in society. In this workshop, we will bring together community organizers, technologists, designers, and researchers to explore what it means to and how we organize and center relationships in the modern era with (or without) computer support, in what contexts we should prioritize organizing rather than mobilizing, and how we might iterate upon our existing framework to respond to our findings. We will produce an iterated draft of a traditional organizing framework.",

      "abstract": "Who is an activist? With the advent of activism-related scholarship in HCI and CSCW, the current challenge involves thinking about what activism is, who an activist is, and the opportunities and limitations of activism. Recently, researchers in academia and industry, such as Timnit Gebru, demonstrate a commitment to stay activated for the structural changes we need, for example, diverse and inclusive scholarship, to address overlapping problems, e.g., sexism, racism, and tokenism. Additionally, there is a continuing dominance of Western, formally educated, industrialized, rich and democratic (WEIRD) perspectives. Countering this requires collective efforts in, citational justice and decolonial computing, among others. But such complex issues do not yet cover the inner conflicts that we face, such as mental health struggles while dismantling the prejudices stemming from the ivory tower, locating our privileges as academics while traversing less privileged locales of research sites, or the dilemmas on whether we are doing enough to fulfill our responsibilities to the people who have trusted us enough to work with us in the face of \"publish or perish\" culture. This workshop explores what activism means within the CSCW community and how we can remain activated while harboring doubts and hopes in calling ourselves \"activists\".",

      "abstract": "This workshop explores socially expressive technology design using collaborative principles of theater, dance and music. Building on shared roots of making something together, technologies (including virtual agents, physical devices, storytelling multimedia) and artistic provocation can create playful, productive and healthy experiences for communities. How do we: Improve collaboration between performance art and creative technology? Design apps and artistic collaboration/learning for mental health? Use theater performativity and technology to enhance our lives? As smart devices become ubiquitous, yet solidarity and cooperation remain elusive in competitive/hierarchical societies, understanding how performance art and technology collaborate can improve how we work, play and care for our and each other’s health. This workshop is a forum and creative space to discuss and play with the future of performative expression and collaborative computing. We welcome researchers and practitioners from varied disciplines including technical implementation, design, theater, dance, improv, physiology and psychology. The program features collaborative creation modules across the expressive human spectrum (movement, sound, text) using digital dramaturgy (Budde, 2017) and pleasure of learning (Brecht, 2001). It also includes participants’ presentations, expert talks and videos exploring the expressive side of computing technology. Accepted applicants are invited to share perspectives and collaborate on creative exercises on art/artefacts/artificiality. ",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is a long-haul disaster that has brought forth extreme hardship, in particular food insecurity. Local citizens across the United States created online groups to facilitate mutual aid, a form of community-based disaster relief. In this paper, we are interested in how online mutual aid groups addressed food insecurity through facilitating various community-based initiatives. We interviewed mutual aid group organizers in the United States and found that online groups contributed immediate food relief as well as laid the groundwork for long-term food security. These findings have implications for community resilience in the wake of an ongoing disaster.",

In this project, primary research was conducted in the context of teaching English to class 12 students from regional language medium schools. The context was understood, difficulties faced in learning, aspects of learning and teaching were identified. The topic of speaking English in daily conversations was prioritized. Existing solutions were analyzed. A design brief consisting of goals based on the research was formulated. Ideas were brainstormed and the final direction was consolidated based on the feedback received. CoSpeak, an interactive mobile application using voice recognition and utilizing collaborative learning was designed iteratively. An evaluation with the teacher and students was conducted using a Wizard of Oz type prototype and future possibilities were identified.",

      "abstract": "News sharing has become prevalent on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Recent empirical works suggest a growing trend that young adults are using Instagram to access and share news. In this work, I explore college students’ news sharing experience on Instagram through an in-depth qualitative interview. The study prompts participants to reflect on their recently shared news pieces to understand news types that get circulated, as well as reasons behind the choice of using Instagram for sharing such content. Research results revealed: news that can help college students to (1) express their opinions, (2) raise awareness of their friends and (3) spark conversations are more likely to be shared on Instagram. The primary mode of sharing is via Instagram stories. Instagram is popular for news sharing because of its convenience of use, easiness of reaching out to peers, and the natural affordance of delivering powerful visual messages. Applying this work as an empirical basis, I propose features that can be added to Instagram to facilitate users’ news reading and sharing experiences.",

      "abstract": "Children grow up in an increasingly digital world and their learning, creating, communicating, and socializing processes are affected by technology from very early on [28]. More than half of teens (57%) aged 13-17 report having started friendships online and 55% say they have used social media to flirt [22]. Internet affords adolescents opportunities to form relationships and explore sexual identities [36], but using it to seek intimacy has also become a key stressor [38], and can pose risks to their safety and wellbeing. Adolescents are using the Internet to seek support and advice about relationships [20] and sexual health [19, 33]. When it comes to online sexual risk, parents and researchers often focus on sexual risk from strangers. However, adolescents are more often victimized by people they know [12, 32]. They also struggle more to reject solicitations such as requests for nudes or sexts from people they know, than from strangers [29]. More research is warranted concerning the issues adolescents seek support for, and on the social support they receive online about their online sexual experiences [2, 17]. We build upon prior research by analyzing social media trace data from an online peer support platform to answer the following research questions:\r\n•\tRQ1) How does peer pressure play a role in adolescent sexting?\r\n•\tRQ2) What is the advice teens received for combatting peer pressure for sexting?\r\n",

Information science researchers have found that social media data can be insightful for probing psychological stress. However, none of the previous studies, to the best of our knowledge, investigated social media data to identify the voices of migrants and refugees and analyze their concerns. We have collected 0.15 million tweets, but only 2% of these tweets are the voices of migrants and refugees. In addition to non-refugee and non-migrant voices, we have classified their voices into three themes as follows: their generic views, initial struggles, and subsequent settlement in the host country. We have employed deep learning and transformer-based models for identifying these themes. Our best-performing transformer-based model has reported an accuracy of 75.89%. We have also identified some exciting avenues for future research.",

Our interview analysis revealed the following \\textit{five main themes}: \r\n  (1) motivation and inspiration for posting social activist content comes from a wide range of \r\n  personal sources, \r\n  (2) video creation practices largely match TikTok standards,\r\n  (3) social activism has communities on TikTok that \r\n  provide encouragement and discussion, \r\n  (4) interaction with other activists and viewers is crucial for social activism content creation\r\n  and \r\n  (5) users choose TikTok for its ability to spread messages more simply and with wider range.\r\n  These findings provide insight into the unique factors that TikTok brings for social activism\r\n  and corroborates previous findings in understanding how social activists may use social media for their purposes.  \r\n\\end{abstract}",

      "abstract": "Fake news is a prevalent problem, particularly in digital media, that undermines trust and cooperation among people. As a variety of global mitigation efforts arise, the understanding of how people consider fake news becomes important, especially in local contexts. To that end, we carried out a survey with 75 participants in Singapore to understand people's perceptions of and practices with news (real and fake). Locally, fake news was found to be more pervasive in instant messaging apps than in social media, with the problem attributed more strongly to sharing than to creation. Good news sharing practices were generally observed. Highest trust was reported in government communication platforms across 11 media items. These results show that Singapore possesses a peculiar sociocultural scene, suggesting that efforts directed towards locally relevant measures may be more effective in addressing fake news in Singapore. We detail the survey results and recommended directions in this paper.",

We analyzed the speech of trauma resuscitation teams in cases with delayed intravenous/intraosseous (IV/IO) line placement, a significant contributor to delays during life-saving interventions. The insights gained from this analysis will inform the design of a clinical decision support system (CDSS) that will use multiple sensor modalities to alert medical teams to errors in real time.

      "abstract": "Drug addiction has become one of the most severe social problems in the United States. Recent research has turned attention to the possibility of using social media to detect opioid usages and offer interventions. However, most prior studies focus on textual and networking-based social media such as Twitter and Facebook. There is limited understanding of how video-based platforms, such as YouTube, allow creators to share drug addiction-related videos and discourse addiction problems. This work is an initial step to fill this knowledge gap by analyzing 166 YouTube videos. We found that YouTubers leverage videos to disclose personal addiction experiences, provide professional recommendations, and express addiction-related opinions and lifestyles. Therefore YouTube videos discuss more of the risks, blames, and solutions of drug addiction. \r\n*Trigger warning: this paper contains substance abuse, addiction, and mental illness.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic recession have negatively affected many people’s physical, social, and psychological health.  Parks and green-spaces may have ameliorated the negative effects of the pandemic by creating opportunities for outdoor recreation and nature exposure, while other public activities and gatherings were restricted due to risk of disease transmissions.  Using park visitation estimates derived from 140K Instagram images shared in four US metropolitan areas, this study investigates trends in park use over the span of the COVID-19 pandemic.  We find that while COVID-related stay-at-home orders are associated with shifts in park visitation, the cities that we analysed do not follow uniform trends.  Our analyses suggest that future research may be able to explain variability in park visitation based on local factors such as park location and the socio-demographics of visitors.  However, the research community does not currently have access to the volume and resolution of data that is necessary to study the issue.  There is an urgent need for the CSCW community and social computing researchers to address this data gap if we are to understand the impacts of the pandemic, plan for urban resiliency, and ensure equitable access to parks and other shared resources.  \r\n",

Older individuals are facing major issues using these applications due to their lack of understanding of the technology and hesitation to adopt them, reducing the benefits of such applications. To further explore these issues, we conducted an online survey with older adults' families (n = 397), preformed online interviews with older adults (n = 5), and undertook observations focused on their experiences. We found that older users of such social pandemic technologies suffered with using these applications by themselves, which resulted in an increased dependence on others to help them with their basic daily social activities, increasing their chances of physically interacting and contracting the coronavirus. Such results make us question the level of technology literacy we reached within our communities, especially with the increased integration of digital technology into all areas of our lives. ",

      "abstract": "As digital making tools, such as 3D printers and laser cutters, become more affordable and easier to use by non-experts, new opportunities arise for geographically distributed designers to use them collaboratively and at a distance. In this exploratory study, we investigated the possibilities of a 3D printing pen for collaboratively creating multimodal stories around the themes of ecology and climate change for elementary school-aged children. Our interdisciplinary team of four students met regularly over a video link and used shared documents and 3D pens to create a multimodal adventure book, with audio and tactile elements, that we then used as a design probe to elicit feedback from experienced community science educators working with children about the possibilities of using hands-on distributed collaborative techniques in the future. We found that using this approach is promising for facilitating creative verbal and visual collaboration at a distance, and using tactile and audio representations with narrative elements provides new ways to reflect on complex topics, such as climate change.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has raised attention toward remote and hybrid communications. Currently, one highly-studied solution lets a remote user use virtual reality (VR) to enter an immersive view of a local space, and local users use augmented reality (AR) to see the remote user’s representation and digital contents. Such systems give the remote user a sense of ‘being there’, but we identify two more challenges to address. First, current systems provide remote users with limited agency to control objects and influence the local space. It is necessary to further explore the relationship between users, virtual objects, and physical objects, and how they can play a role in providing richer agency. Second, current systems often try to replicate in-person experiences, but hardly surpass them. We propose XRmas: an AR/VR telepresence system that (1) provides a multi-agency space that allows a remote user to manipulate both virtual and physical objects in a local space, and (2) introduces three family activities in a Christmas context that adopt holographic animation effects to create a ‘magical’ experience that takes users beyond merely the feeling of ‘being there’. We report on preliminary insights from the use of such a system in a remote family communication context.",

      "abstract": "Collaboration provides opportunities for students to absorb different perspectives of knowledge [1,2] and generate more creative ideas [3,4]. In the design discipline, collaboration is essential for designers to identify problems, needs, and opportunities, and to promote an iterative design process [5,6]. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced challenges for both instructors and students in 2020 as these collaborations could not happen in person. We surveyed the students in a large design fundamentals class about their online collaborative experience throughout the three phases of their individual design projects. We share findings about the benefits and challenges students perceived during this collaboration. This study contributes to our understanding of the power of collaboration, especially in an online environment. Our findings can empower instructors and researchers to build more engaging online learning experiences by including opportunities for student collaboration.",

Given the wide variety of projects, some level of expertise or, alternatively, some guidance for novice participants can greatly improve the quality of the collected data. A significant portion of citizen science projects depends on visual data, where photos or videos of different subjects are needed. Often these visual data are collected from all over the world, including remote locations. In this article, we introduce an authoring platform for easily creating mobile apps for citizen science projects that are empowered with client-side machine learning (ML) guidance. The apps created with our platform can help participants recognize the correct data and increase the efficiency of the data collection process. We demonstrate the application of our proposed platform with two use cases: a rip current detection app for a planned pilot study and a detection app for biodiversity-related projects.",

CSCW researchers have shown the potential for collaborative technologies to enhance social support in different settings. However, less is known about the potential for CSCW technologies to augment social support practices within family caregiving circles. In this poster, we describe findings from 14 interviews with parents of children hospitalized for cancer treatment. We categorized the support practices between parents and found that they rely heavily on technology to support each other from a distance. We identified opportunities for designing future collaborative technology to augment social support in caregiving teams.",

      "abstract": "During the early distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., older adults aged 65 and above were prioritized in states such as Florida. The distribution primarily relied upon online systems of appointment reservations. This paper investigates the sociotechnical challenges faced by older adults in the U.S., who tend to have relatively low digital literacy, while attempting to seek and secure COVID-19 vaccine appointments. The challenges included issues with the fragmentation of appointment systems, lack of transparency in vaccination information, and technical challenges in navigating online systems. This paper discusses the emotional burdens experienced by older adults in this process, and unpacks the ways in which older adults have navigated through these challenges and their resilient strategies for seeking appointments. This paper identifies opportunities for future CSCW work in investigating citizens' infrastructuring work (especially the informal work carried out by vulnerable groups) in the wake of disrupted vaccination infrastructure and neoliberal governance.",

      "abstract": "Social virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular. People today can leverage VR to meet and interact with others, especially when face-to-face (F2F) social events are not as practical. While strategies and cues being used in F2F interactions have been previously studied in CSCW, it remains unclear how people use various cues to interact with others in VR-based events, and whether the usage of different cues in such VR events differs from F2F interactions. To start addressing these questions, we conducted an online survey study, inviting VR event attendees to recall their recent social interaction experiences and cues usage in initiating, maintaining, and finishing interactions with event co-attendees in VR and F2F situations respectively (N=51). Results from the survey revealed differential cues usage in VR-based and in F2F interactions, which could shed light on the design of VR tools toward supporting online social events.",

      "abstract": "When people live in a home with others, they feel connected through passive, subtle signs of togetherness. Feeling co-present and connected over distance is a challenge, especially when living across different timezones. A key challenge when designing for communication over timezones is the difficulty of arranging synchronous communication, which makes traditional methods like phone conversations or video calls difficult. Additionally, the richness of passive, ambient togetherness is lost through these communication methods. We investigate the role of sounds in passive togetherness in co-located homes, and speculate about their implications for asynchronous design for togetherness over distance.",

      "abstract": "Sharing sensitive information online, such as one’s sexual identity or medical information, can be a complex decision. Many people do not share sensitive information out of fear of being stigmatized, yet sharing can be beneficial for a variety of reasons. This study examines two instances of sensitive disclosure within the SAA (same-sex attracted adolescents) community: people revealing their LGBTQ+ status on social media and revealing the use of an anti-HIV medication, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), on both social media and dating platforms. By examining these two disclosure decisions, we can better understand how designers can support sensitive disclosure. Ultimately, results suggest that designing for disclosure doesn’t mean designing to get people to explicitly disclose, but rather enabling users to subtly communicate sensitive information. Moreover, rationales for disclosing sensitive information play out differently between social media and dating platforms. ",

Participants (n=17) were dating app users identifying as LGBTQIA+ or women (demographics at disproportionate risk of sexual violence). Participants envisioned dating apps encouraging safer consent exchange practices by normalizing discussions around consent and sexual boundaries online, before meeting face-to-face with potential sex partners. The design ideas generated by the participants, which we coded as Consent Communication Progression, involved the dating app messaging interface using AI-driven conversation prompts. Such prompts would gradually progress messaging conversations towards topics of consent and sexual boundaries with an algorithm that tailors the prompts to specific users. Participants applied a consent lens when imagining human-AI interaction, in which conversation prompts would only be posted in the interface if the user first consented to the particular conversation occurring. Implications for future work are discussed.",

Many studies have developed diverse ways of re-designing roles of an actor to stimulate scenario speculation; however, a lack of understandings of how the presence of an actor influences the scenario speculation process. Therefore, this work conducted a study that investigates how everyday photos with and without human actors affect people to speculate possible scenarios. We recruited 29 crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to generate 80 scenarios for two groups of photos (i.e., with-actor and non-actor photos). We analysed these scenarios and found that with-actor photos led people to speculate consistent scenarios around human actors and their activities. By contrast, non-actor photos allowed people to speculate the scenarios flexibly and diversely. These insights suggest a new design opportunity of using non-actor photos as potential materials to encourage people to generate diverse scenarios. ",

A potential problem with the unprecedentedly central role of online meetings in a wide range of everyday activities is the disruption it may cause to intersubjective experiences, an intuitive mutual understanding of the participants and their thinking of themselves as a group, a “we”. To address this problem, about half a year into the pandemic we conducted an exploratory study, in which the informants (N=36) completed a survey, comprising a set of Likert scales and open-ended questions focusing on “team spirit”, moment-to-moment coordination, emotions, and the sense of presence in online and physical meetings. The results indicate that online meetings may present particular challenges regarding the experience of “we-ness”, and different types of online meetings can be experienced differently. Implications of the results for further research are discussed. ",

      "abstract": "It is often argued that one goal of explaining automated decision systems (ADS) is to facilitate positive perceptions (e.g., fairness or trustworthiness) of users towards such systems. This viewpoint, however, makes the implicit assumption that a given ADS is fair and trustworthy, to begin with. If the ADS issues unfair outcomes, then one might expect that explanations regarding the system's workings will reveal its shortcomings and, hence, lead to a decrease in fairness perceptions. Consequently, we suggest that it is more meaningful to evaluate explanations against their effectiveness in enabling people to appropriately assess the quality (e.g., fairness) of an associated ADS. We argue that for an effective explanation, perceptions of fairness should increase if and only if the underlying ADS is fair. In this in-progress work, we introduce the desideratum of appropriate fairness perceptions, propose a novel study design for evaluating it, and outline next steps towards a comprehensive experiment.",

      "abstract": "Despite being characterized as constantly on and connected, IM users’ responsiveness varies across different contacts. While research has shown that the relationship between conversation partners plays an important role in influencing their communication patterns, characterization of such patterns simply by using relationship information is limited \\cite{Lee2019cluster, Lee2019does}. In this paper, we identify five distinct clusters of IM patterns using unsupervised learning derived from 46 users’ conversation history. We show that the relationship category sufficed to characterize three clusters of communication patterns, but failed for the most active one. However, considering both relationship and topics would distinguish most communication patterns, including the most active one. This result suggests that future research on IM communication patterns should pay more attention to the topics in users' conversations. ",

      "abstract": "Online fanfiction communities enable young people to make connections through their shared interests. Prior research has found that informal learning takes place in fanfiction platforms through distributed mentoring, which includes the writing and receiving of story reviews to one another that have significant effects on young authors’ literacy skill development. The pandemic lockdown has limited young people's access to forming social connections, and it also stimulated engagement in online informal learning. Therefore, it is crucial to study online fanfiction communities as a prototype for designing future informal learning platforms. This study focuses on reviewing, one of the main components of distributed mentoring, to explore whether reciprocal patterns exist in the sending and receiving of reviews among fanfiction authors. We used a social network analysis approach by modeling users’ interactions through reviews as directed graphs and performed correlation analysis to test the proposed hypotheses. The results provided significant evidence that supports the existence of reciprocal patterns among users’ interactions through reviews.",

      "abstract": "Collaborative music listening can support intergenerational connectedness. We conducted an environmental scan of video conferencing and music listening platforms and cognitive walkthroughs to investigate how these platforms can support collaborative music listening and conversation between a grandparent and teen grandchild. Our results indicate that common video conferencing platforms not only lack a convenient way to share music, but typically block audio from music listening apps played on the same device, preventing sharing. Further, while music streaming platforms enable connected friends to share songs and others' playlists, they do not provide a means for smooth synchronous conversing about the music. Thus, this highlights opportunities for technology improvement to support intergenerational relationships by enabling distributed, intergenerational co-listening of music.",

The food delivery eco-system includes four actors: platform, restaurant, courier and customer. It differs from other well-studied “gig” platforms such as Uber or Amazon Mechanical Turk as it brings together a business and a gig-worker. Based on our qualitative study involving couriers and restaurants, we demonstrate that a cooperation is needed between restaurants and couriers to perform food delivery. The way platforms are designed does not support this cooperation as it is affected by the waiting times at the restaurants and the rating system. A dedicated space where both couriers and restaurants could directly give feedback and information could enhance their understanding of the situation and thus enable cooperation.",

For women, such challenges can be further magnified owing to the need to perform traditional roles along with sustaining a professional career. Through an analysis of a random sample of 10 discussion threads (80 conversation traces) from a subreddit called r/careerwomen, we explore the needs that draw women to use such forums and the ways in which such forums help develop endurance. Our preliminary analysis provides 2 main themes towards understanding how multiple socio-cultural pressures create tensions in defining one’s sense of worth. In contrast, 5 other themes provide insights into strategies to redefine norms of worth. Building on these themes, we propose the analytical frame of morale repair, which aims to discuss how such socio-technical interventions can be designed and structured to further address the struggles for women in establishing a sense of worth.",

Using a Research through Design approach, we explored possibilities for enabling social distributed board game play amongst friends and family.

Through reflecting on this prototype, we discuss challenges for the design of distributed board games, including incorporating tangible inputs and accommodating a variety of household configurations. We also identify a set of design qualities, including spatiality, tangibility, and presence, that can inform the design of systems for social distributed board game play. ",

This paper analyzes and compares three different forums, Health Boards, Patient and Reddit, using three major conditions as representative samples: blood pressure, depression and diabetes. The analysis investigates three principal dimensions: the intensity of user engagement, the explicit coverage of salient entities such as frequent symptoms or risk factors, and the degree of medical detail expressed by specific drugs and their dosages. We report on commonalities across the three forums and on key findings about how they differ in their contents and interactions.",

However, despite their growing ubiquity, less is known on how task difficulty in such environments mitigates verbal communication patterns. We report on a study investigating this research question, finding that although manipulations of task difficulty did appear to impact broad team level communication measures (e.g. how much they talked), it largely had minimal impact on team communication dynamics (e.g. the flow of communication between various roles in the teams). The implications of this study for the design of future team training environments along with the possibility of artificial agents to support team training as a novel use case are then discussed in turn.",

Recent work suggested that visualization of spiritual support networks offers a promising design mechanism for helping patients and caregivers navigate life-threatening physical or mental illnesses. Therefore, through user-centered and community-situated inquiry, we designed and developed SoulGarden--an interface that helps users visualize their spiritual support network in order to reduce loneliness and increase a sense of community and belonging. Initial feedback from user tests suggests that our nature-based theme provides users with feelings of calm and comfort, and that seeing the faces and prayers of supporters adds a meaningful sensory component to online support exchange. Our evaluation also suggests three valuable design considerations for future support network visualizations.",

      "abstract": "During a dynamic and protracted crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, citizens are continuously challenged with making decisions under uncertainty. In addition to evaluating the risk of their behaviors to themselves and others, citizens also have to consider the most current regulation, which often varies federally and locally and by incidence numbers. Few tools help to stay informed about the current rules. The state-run German multi-hazard warning app NINA incorporated a feature for COVID-19, while two apps, DarfIchDas and CoroBuddy, focus only on COVID-19 regulation and are privately run. To investigate users' expectations, perceived advantages, and gaps as well as the developers’ challenges, we analyze recent app store reviews of the apps and developers' replies. We show that the warning app and the COVID-19 regulation apps are evaluated on different terms, that the correctness and portrayal of complex rules are the main challenges and that developers and editors are underusing users’ potential for crowdsourcing.",

However, there is limited understanding in HCI and CSCW of how the ASMRtist community on YouTube leveraged the multi-sensorial stimuli to design the experiences of calm and relaxation and construct parasocial relationships with the viewers. This work presents a typology to understand the multimodal interactions and parasocial attractiveness in YouTube ASMR videos. The annotation of 88 YouTube ASMR videos reveals that, beyond tingling sensation, ASMR videos are also experiences of social connection, physical intimacy, and activity observation. We describe the future design and research opportunities to utilize ASMR effects in video-based applications.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents emerging findings from a participatory design study with women about how future designs of opportunistic social matching systems can foreground user safety. The study is motivated by a relative lack of focus on user safety in social matching systems (Tinder, Bumble, etc.) in light of advances to user discovery mechanisms that enable increasingly rapid face-to-face encounters. Findings highlight ways that social matching systems could support users’ safety after they have left home to pursue a social opportunity in the physical world. Co-designers envisioned a social matching system acting as a “guardian” that genuinely cares for, and monitors, the user’s safety even if it cannot flawlessly mitigate harm. Rather than respond only after a definitive harm has occurred, co-designers expected the system to intervene earlier, during ambiguously unsafe or uncomfortable situations. The paper considers directions for future work in response to users’ expectations for how social matching systems should coordinate with trusted contacts to intervene in unsafe situations.",

      "abstract": "With advanced technologies, 3D exoscopes have been introduced in the operating room and considered as an alternative to microscopes which have been a gold standard visualization tool in microsurgery. While many recent papers have examined the impact of the 3D exoscopes on a surgeon's performance, it has not been investigated how the 3D exoscopes affect the dynamic socio-technical environment of the operating room. We present preliminary findings from a field study exploring how the 3D exoscopes reconfigure the existing practice of surgical team members (i.e., assistant surgeons, scrub nurses, and circulating nurses). We identified that one of the big advantages of the 3D exoscopes, the 3D visualization, rather impedes their workflow and teamwork. We note that design factors of the 3D exoscope should be carefully considered to build a better operating room environment for all surgical members. ",

      "abstract": "While task-oriented chatbots have become popular recently, conversational breakdowns are still common and will often lead to unfavorable user experiences. Guidance serves a crucial role in helping users to understand how to have better interaction with chatbots. Nonetheless, questions like what kinds of guidance to provide and when to provide guidance remain underexplored. In this study, we examined users' preferences for two types of guidance (Example-Based and Rule-Based) at four guidance timings (Service-Opening, Task-Opening, After-Error, and On-Demand). Our results show that users preferred Example-based guidance, and generally preferred guidance provided at Task-Opening. Example-based guidance appearing at Task-Opening was the favorite guidance combination for most participants. Through analysis of participants’ explanations of their preferences, the strengths and weaknesses of these guidance types and guidance timings are presented. The preliminary results are based on a subset of the data (n=24). Further in-depth investigation into the underlying factors that influence users' preferences for guidance, as well as the interplay effect between guidance type and guidance timing is needed. \r\n",

      "abstract": "Sharing mutual experiences on the same topic is an effective way to increase members’ sense of belonging to the community, but existing approaches are insufficient in building such a narrative when a community tries to connect remotely, due to barriers in sharing and organizing content. In this paper, we present Collective Narrative (CN), a context-aware system that facilitates users in identifying share-worthy moments through in-context prompting, and automates the organization process through informed section assignment to a narrative structure. A preliminary study testing the CN iPhone app demonstrates that CN can potentially scaffold in-the-moment sharings and form narratives that are comprehensive yet diverse, thereby presenting contributions in a way that users could easily identify mutual experiences and feelings by reading the narrative. \r\n",

However, leading teams is challenging. In particular, in video-meetings, leadership is complex due to limitations such as aggravated understanding of social signals and team dynamics. Voice-based smart personal assistants (SPA) such as Amazon’s Alexa can provide real-time support and have the potential to maintain effective leadership in video-meetings. Therefore, we developed the SPA LeadBoSki for real-time leadership support in video-meetings. LeadBoSki detects leadership potentials in video-meetings and sends leadership potential advice to the leader. Pilot study results with two real-world teams (n=9) show a positive leader experience and stimulating behavior by the leader for the team members’ motivation. Our work contributes with the SPA LeadBoSki as the first SPA for leadership support in video-meetings of its kind and as a potential use-case for future workplaces.",

      "abstract": "When friends live across different time zones, have incompatible work schedules, or have different levels of access to technology, synchronous communication becomes infeasible. To address this challenge, we developed a web application that allows friends to asynchronously collaborate creatively. In this application, multiple people can contribute to the writing of a story, told partially by a natural language AI system. By offloading some of the creative work to the AI, the human writers have the opportunity to also act as readers, being surprised by new events in the story. To gain preliminary insights into the experience of using this system, we conducted an informal pilot study over a span of 5 days. Through this process, we learned that storytelling with an AI system can encourage roleplay, it can be a cathartic experience, and it is curiosity-driven. Our recommendations for future research include (1) investigating new turn-taking strategies, and clearly communicating turns through the interface, (2) providing guidance for the prompt-writing process, perhaps through editable prompt templates, and (3) conducting a thorough evaluation of the system with friend groups of various sizes and timezones.",

Online discussions that span diverse agendas can help readers mitigate the biased influences from news media. However, displaying comments based on popular voting often fails to reveal such diversities to readers. In this paper, we designed a proof-of-concept Hagendas that aims to improve awareness of divergent agendas in online news discussions. It presents possible agendas automatically derived from news articles, and enables readers to view and filter the comments accordingly. We evaluated how Hagendas would affect users' online news discussion practices through a within-subjects experiment with 95 online participants from MTurk. While the agenda tags and filtering features did not significantly increase the number of distinct agendas people identified through reading comments, 77.9% of participants preferred having those features for exploring online news discussion.",

While this has historically been an analog process, people now use collaboration or messenger apps to support their self-organization. Unfortunately, these apps are not designed to be resilient and fail with communication infrastructure outages when servers are no longer available. We provide a resilience concept with requirements derived from an interdisciplinary view enabling citizens to communicate and collaborate in everyday life and during crisis events. Our human-centered prototype integrates concepts of nudging for crisis preparedness, decentralized and secure communication, participation, smart resource management, historical knowledge, and legal issues to help guide further research.",

To this end, we designed a chatbot for residents of a co-living space based on the following principles: (1) The range of shared information is limited to three areas derived from the similarities of the residents, and it takes a ‘give-and-take QnA’ structure, where one should answer a question from another resident after they ask a question. (2) Conversation is designed to resemble a human-like dialogue to reveal the presence of other residents. 19 residents of a co-living space used the chatbot for a week through the Wizard of Oz method, and six participants were asked about their chatbot experience through a semi-structured interview after the usage. A total of 58 interactions occurred, and the reply rate of the chatbot’s question was 76%. The interview revealed that the users were satisfied with chatbot’s provision of information that could only be given by fellow residents, and the chatbot increased the presence of other residents, creating a feeling of social connection. We conclude the paper by proposing design principles for chatbots in collective housing.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we examined how users strategically leveraged the two affordances, content persistence and ephemerality, for self-presentation and relationship maintenance on Instagram. In contrast to other social media platforms that usually support either persistent (e.g., Twitter) or transient content sharing (e.g., Snapchat), Instagram affords both functions through regular posts and short-lived Story. We conducted a seven-day diary study on Instagram users (n=13) and used the data as probes for follow-up in-depth one-on-one interview. Our findings show that people deliberately curated persistent posts to present their ideal images. In contrast, ephemeral Story shows more authentic and casual sides of self. With the interpersonal and ephemeral touch, Story creates more private and directed engagement among users and their audiences than the interactions derived from posts. Story also helps users develop deeper relationships and extended interaction with others without experiencing “context-collapse.”",

      "abstract": "Health coaching can be an effective intervention to support self-management of chronic conditions like diabetes, but there are not enough coaching practitioners to scalably reach the growing population in need of support. Conversational technology, like chatbots, presents an opportunity to extend health coaching support to broader and more diverse populations. However, some have suggested that the human element is essential to health coaching and cannot be replicated with technology. In this research, we examine automated health coaching using a theory-grounded, wizard-of-oz chatbot, in comparison with text-based virtual coaching from human practitioners who start with the same protocol as the chatbot but have the freedom to embellish and adjust as needed. We found that even a scripted chatbot can create a coach-like experience for participants. While human coaches displayed advantages expressing empathy and using probing questions to tailor their support, they also encountered tremendous barriers and frustrations adapting to text-based virtual coaching. The chatbot coach had advantages in being persistent, as well as more consistently giving choices and options to foster client autonomy. We discuss implications for the design of virtual health coaching interventions.",

      "abstract": "The rise of social media has changed the nature of the fashion industry. Influence is no longer concentrated in the hands of an elite few: social networks have distributed power across a broader set of tastemakers. To understand this new landscape of influence, we created FITNet --- a network of 10,000 fashion-related Twitter accounts that heavily influence the larger Twitter fashion graph. To construct FITNet, we trained a content-based classifier to predict which accounts are related to fashion. Leveraging this classifier, we estimated the size of Twitter's fashion subgraph, snowball sampled more than 300k fashion-related accounts based on following relationships, and identified the top 10,000 influencers, or FITNet, in the resulting subgraph. We asked 55 fashion undergraduates to validate and further categorize the accounts in FITNet. These categorizations allow us to analyze interactions between influential people, brands, retailers, and media in fashion.",

      "abstract": "Wikipedia is the product of thousands of editors working collaboratively to provide free and up-to-date encyclopedic information to the project's users.  This article asks to what degree Wikipedia articles in three languages --- Hindi, Urdu, and English --- achieve Wikipedia’s mission of making neutrally-presented, reliable information on a polarizing, controversial topic available to people around the globe.   We chose the topic of the recent revocation of Article 370 of the Constitution of India, which, along with other recent events in and concerning the region of Jammu and Kashmir, has drawn attention to related articles on Wikipedia.  This work focuses on the English Wikipedia, being the preeminent language edition of the project, as well as the Hindi and Urdu editions. Hindi and Urdu are the two standardized varieties of Hindustani, a lingua franca of Jammu and Kashmir. We analyzed page view and revision data for three Wikipedia articles to gauge popularity of the pages in our corpus, and responsiveness of editors to breaking news events and problematic edits. Additionally, we interviewed editors from all three language editions to learn about differences in editing processes and motivations, and we compared the text of the articles across languages, as they appeared shortly after the revocation of Article 370. While activity on South Asian language editions of Wikipedia is growing, at the time of writing, the Hindi and Urdu editions are still in their nascency. In Hindi and Urdu, as well as English, editors predominantly try to adhere to the principle of neutral point of view (NPOV), and for the most part, the editors quash attempts by other editors to push political agendas.",

      "abstract": "Online health communities (OHCs) have become important sources where members can obtain social support. Since most benefits of OHCs are provided by OHC members, it is crucial that OHCs maintain a critical mass of active members. This paper examines temporal changes in members' participation in a cancer-oriented OHC, focusing on the changes in members' motivations and behavior as they transition from newcomers to other roles or ultimately leave the community. Our work used mixed methods, combining behavioral log analysis, automated content analysis, surveys and interviews. We found that shifts in members' motivations seemed to be driven by two sources: the internal dynamics common to becoming a member of most online communities and the external needs associated with their cancer journey. When members' disease-driven needs for support decreased, most members quit the site. The motivations of those who stayed shifted from receiving support to providing it to others in the community. As in many online communities, oldtimers contributed the vast majority of content. However, they encountered challenges that threatened their commitment, including negative emotion related to other members' deaths, which led them to take leaves of absence from the community or to drop out permanently. Implications for the motivation changes of OHC members are discussed.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we compare two cases of collaboration within healthcare in two European countries. In each of these two cases, we conducted a design case study, and we found that collaboration is ad hoc, temporary, and shifting with regards to collaborators, aims, and processes. We argue for the relevance of knotworking and its analytic potential for investigating the kind of collaborative work we observed. We also argue that our two cases present a higher complexity level than how knotworking has previously been described in the literature. We describe complex knotworking as having three characteristics: 1) collaboration happens between a dynamic number of actors (who are usually loosely connected), 2) collaboration happens in episodes, and 3) cooperative work arrangements are constantly negotiated. Using the concept of complex knotworking for a comparative analysis of our two design solutions, we outline generic design guidelines for developing computer support to manage complex knotworking situations.",

      "abstract": "Congestion control mechanisms, by which network users share constrained capacity on Internet links, are heavily studied in computer science. Such mechanisms are traditionally automated, assuming that users do not wish to be involved in addressing congestion. However, in community-owned and operated networks, users have control over daily operational choices. We explore the design of community-based congestion policies and mechanisms, through the lens of network capacity as a Common Pool Resource (CPR). Through a series of workshops and interviews in a rural community in Oaxaca, Mexico, we encounter design opportunities for new types of tools supporting communal network management. Participants expressed desires for preserving individual privacy while collecting longitudinal data to track the network's impact on the community, prioritization of high-value applications, equal link sharing between users, and human-mediated congestion management in lieu of automated enforcement. We report qualitative insights and offer design directions for future systems to address network resources in a manner compatible with Ostrom's principles for CPR governance.",

Prior research has explored new technology designs to support shared activities and context in remote communication. Only a few studies have investigated the long-term impact of novel technology design on people‚Äôs social connectedness. My dissertation work explores technology design that support in-person social practices in remote context during shared activities, and studies the long-term effect of the proposed system design on people‚Äôs social connections. The four different studies are designed to understand current practices with shared activities in building and maintaining social connections, design communication technology to nurture meaningful relationship during remote activities and evaluate the proposed system with a long-term field study. Overall, my dissertation contributes an in-depth understanding of how technology can better support people‚Äôs social practices during shared activities and helps inform opportunities for technology to better connect people.",

      "abstract": "In Health Science Education (HSE), students must demonstrate technical skills in many procedures. However, traditional teaching methodologies limit the possibilities for personalized feedback from an instructor and do not allow students to achieve the required proficiency levels. Concerning this, technology has been installed as a learning resource with numerous benefits that allow new multidisciplinary lines of research, such as learning analytics (LA) and educational data mining (EDM). Both LA and EDM seek to improve educational practice based on the intensive use of educational data, such as analyzing online learning patterns, creating performance predictions, and incorporating artificial intelligence techniques. There is a range of possibilities in applying LA and EDM in teaching procedural skills that have not yet been explored. For this reason, this study aims to answer (1) How the educational data explain the development of procedural skills in virtual environments to support the teaching-learning process in Health Science Education?; and (2) How automatic feedback and adaptive personalization affect the performance and instructional design of the procedural skills learning process of health science students? We expect that this study contributes to the field of technical skills learning mediated by technology in higher education by using the data provided by the interaction of students with virtual resources to support educational decision-making and optimize the teaching and learning processes in HSE.",

      "abstract": "More and more people form and maintain workplace relationships through computer-mediated communication tools nowadays. When all interactions are mediated by technology, people‚Äôs impression of each other can be affected by the selective social cues transmitted by media. The way people present themselves through communication technology might not be perceived by their remote counterparts in the same way as they do. The mediated social cues could affect how people interpret the perceived action, further affecting impression formation and relationship maintenance between remote collaborators. It is unclear whether and how such mediated social cues cause perception gaps and how such perception gaps among different social connections play a part in relationship building in remote workplaces. The goal of my doctoral thesis is to identify the perception gap in computer-mediated communication and its impact on workplace relationship building. First, in a mixed-methods study in remote workplaces, I found that people‚Äôs perceptions of their strongly and weakly connected colleagues become polarized when their collaboration is mediated by different communication technologies. Next, I specifically focused on relationship building between potential collaborators, which is another type of weakly connected collaborators in workplaces, via videoconferencing. In a controlled online study, I found that ambient cues from virtual backgrounds cause different impacts on first impressions of remote collaborators and perception of self. With this doctoral thesis, I aim to provide design implications on designing social cues to reduce the perception gaps introduced by communication technology in different stages of workplace relationship building.",

In the U.S., Earlier advocacy work focused on law reform to empower survivors in influencing the public and state in taking DV seriously and providing resources to support and protect survivors. However, harm is still perpetuated systemically and socially for survivors, especially from religious and racial minorities. In my dissertation work, I focus on DV within the Muslim population in the U.S. due to the unique issues Muslim survivors face when dealing with governmental services and service providers (e.g., gendered Islamophobia, racial discrimination, punitive actions) and within the Muslim community itself (e.g., community trauma, untrained faith leaders in dealing with abuse). I argue that in order to validate the Muslim survivor‚Äôs experience, provide competent resources and information, and allow for informed decision making, a transformative justice (TJ) approach supported by Islamic feminism and trauma-informed healing concepts must be integrated into design, to provide a multidimensional approach to tackling DV within the Muslim community. I will conceptually explore the strengths and weaknesses of using a TJ model through using design as a mode of social inquiry to elicit and understand the social phenomena of DV and TJ within sociotechnical interventions.",

Via exploratory, semi-structured interviews with those deploying a number of urban sensor networks in a single American city, we identify ways that human decision-making and collaborative processes influence how these infrastructures are built. We synthesize into a framework in which sociotechnical factors show up across the phases of data collection, management, analysis, and impacts within smart city projects. Each phase can display variability in immediacy, automation, geographic scope, and ownership. Finally, we use our situated work to discuss a generalizable tension within smart city projects between cross-domain data integration and fragmentation and provide implications for CSCW research, the design of smart city data platforms, and municipal policy.",

While their notions of care for communities and data may sometimes conflict, a range of stakeholders collaborate in their activities with data on immigration, including settlement service providers, migrant justice activists, immigration researchers, government staff and policymakers, and designers of digital systems that gather newcomers‚Äô data. As a connected yet distanced collective of stakeholders whose practices with data influence one another and the newcomers they study or serve, these same stakeholders also enact changes in their ways of using data and digital technologies in the context of experimentation with big data analytics, automation, and greater demands for data-based reporting and sharing. To this end, this research joins practical and theoretical discussions by working to strengthen webs of relations with greater capacity for care, informed reflection, and responsibility in the use of communities‚Äô data. Based on the lens of care, this project advances a critical approach to drastic shifts in information practices across areas of contemporary life, of which migration is a particularly pressing issue.",

While prior research has paid attention to the implications of a break-up on the involved parties‚Äô mental and emotional well-being, and identified best practices for healing and growing from a break-up, these findings and practices are not well suited to how people‚Äôs lives and experiences are represented in social media. People know how to break-up offline; however, they ‚Äì and by extension, social media algorithms that recommend or remind ‚Äì lack the ability to accurately represent the experience of breaking up online. Features that encourage connection or reminiscence are ill-suited for handling break-ups, making suggestions at a time when they may not be perceived as appropriate or desired. In my dissertation, I use three interpretivist, interview-based studies to investigate people‚Äôs expectations of what is or is not appropriate behavior online after a break-up, and who to remain connected with on social media sites. My prior work established that algorithms are not always attuned to the nuances of human experiences like break-ups. Building on that work, my dissertation explores what people want when it comes to their online audiences and sharing behavior after going through a break-up, and leverages that understanding to offer design suggestions to improve both user experience and algorithmic systems in social media. My dissertation will result in empirical and design contributions that improve people‚Äôs online experiences when going through a break-up.",

However, a body of emerging research is showing what older adults share in such user-centered design activities might not reflect their actual needs or preference. Hence, for my dissertation I seek to go beyond what older adults simply say or do in user-centered design activities and understand the larger socio-material configurations in which older individuals and their technologies participate. To do this, I use the Entanglement HCI framework to analyze data from interviews and co-design activities with older adults focused on the topic of use and design of conversational AI assistants. In doing so, my dissertation will provide an empirical understanding of a) the different actors (human and non-human) that configure older adults‚Äô use and perception of emerging technologies, b) identify implications for designing conversation voice technologies for older adults, and c) provide a preliminary understanding of what Entanglement HCI has to offer for understanding some challenging phenomena of Aging in CSCW and HCI, and thereby provide new perspectives on how we could include older adults in designing the next generation of technologies.",

      "abstract": "As the amount of information online continues to grow, a correspondingly important opportunity is for individuals to reuse knowledge which has been summarized by others rather than starting from scratch. However, appropriate reuse requires judging the relevance, trustworthiness, and thoroughness of others' knowledge in relation to an individual's goals and context. In this work, we explore augmenting judgements of the appropriateness of reusing knowledge in the domain of programming, specifically of reusing artifacts that result from other developers' searching and decision making. Through an analysis of prior research on sensemaking and trust, along with new interviews with developers, we synthesized a framework for reuse judgements. The interviews also validated that developers express a desire for help with judging whether to reuse an existing decision. From this framework, we developed a set of techniques for capturing the initial decision maker's behavior and visualizing signals calculated based on the behavior, to facilitate subsequent consumers' reuse decisions, instantiated in a prototype system called Strata. Results of a user study suggest that the system significantly improves the accuracy, depth, and speed of reusing decisions. These results have implications for systems involving user-generated content in which other users need to evaluate the relevance and trustworthiness of that content.",

      "abstract": "Although often ignored, adult gamers, just like the children and adolescents, can suffer from problematic gaming. This study explored the use of a built-in game gradual intervention system (G-GIS), designed to help adult gamers build their wanted game habits in an autonomous and acceptable way. In this study, we interviewed 26 heavy adult gamers (i.e. adult gamers who played the game frequently and for a relatively long time) of an online poker game (with a G-GIS in-built) and triangulated the interview results with their real-world behavioral data collected in eight months, to explore how demographics, attitudes, and contextual factors influence their use of the G-GIS. The results of the study showed that family and occupation demographics play key roles in determining adult gamers’ gaming habits and their self-control under the G-GIS intervention. We also revealed that adult gamers’ attitudes and contextual factors would facilitate or hinder the effectiveness of the G-GIS. The findings of this study extend people’s understanding of heavy adult gamers and reveal how a G-GIS influences the adult gamers from the individual level, which can be applied to design future game intervention systems, especially for the adult gamers.",

      "abstract": "Older adults are especially vulnerable to online cybersecurity and privacy (SP) threats, such as phishing, ransomware, and targeted misinformation campaigns. Prior work has suggested that this vulnerability may be addressed with the design of social SP interfaces, such that groups of individuals might work together on behalf of one another to manage SP threats collectively. To this end, we present findings from a qualitative inquiry conducted with older adults and members of technology-rich middle-income households in urban India, where technology users have been shown to engage in relatively more social SP practices. Our research examines the collaborative behaviors enacted by different members of the household for protection from SP threats. In particular, we show how self-appointed family technology managers straddle the line between stewardship and paternalism in their efforts to protect older adults' from perceived digital threats. We also offer design implications for supporting collaborative cybersecurity within households based on the insights derived from our analysis.",

      "abstract": "With easy access to affordable internet-powered smartphones, developing countries are adopting smartphone applications to provide enabling services to its citizens, including eHealth, eGovernance, and digital payments. The challenge is to ensure equitable access to these services by everyone, including people with semi-literacy or low-literacy who form a large part of the population in developing nations. However, extensive HCI literature has identified literacy as one of the barriers to designing user interfaces. In this work, we propose a framework of actionable guidelines for designing smartphone UIs that would be usable by low-literate users. We reviewed the last two decades of HCI literature engaging people with low literacy, to synthesize our framework. To evaluate the framework, we did a preliminary study with a group of 20 practitioners and researchers working in the field of UI/UX/HCI. We also analyzed six publicly available industry reports on designing UIs for people with low-literacy. The proposed guidelines intend to support researchers, practitioners, designers, and implementers in the design and evaluation of UIs of smartphone applications for people with low literacy. We present the evolutionary nature of the proposed framework while highlighting the importance of adopting a translational approach when building such frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Mobile-based scams are on the rise in emerging markets. However, mobile users' awareness about these scams and the ways to avoid them remains limited. We present an analysis of a qualitative study to examine dynamics of SMS and call based frauds, collectively referred to as mobile-based frauds in the paper, in Pakistan with 96 participants, including different stakeholders in the mobile financial ecosystem: 71 victims of SMS and voice scam, seven non-victims, 15 mobile money agents, and three officials from regulatory agencies that investigate mobile-based phishing attacks. Leveraging the perspectives from different stakeholders, we make four concrete contributions: First, using the four-step social-engineering attack framework, we identify the nuances as well as specific tactics that fraudsters use to scam mobile users.  Second, we look beyond the victim and the adversary to study all the actors involved or affected, the roles they played at each step, and the methods and resources used by the adversaries. Third, we discuss victims' understanding of mobile frauds, their behavior post-realization, and their attitudes toward reporting fraud. Finally, we discuss possible points of intervention and offer design recommendations to thwart mobile fraud, including addressing the vulnerabilities in the ecosystem discovered during this study, utilizing existing actors to mitigate the consequences of these attacks, and revisiting the design of fraud reporting mechanisms to be in line with the sociocultural practices.",

It starts by reviewing concepts of improvisational learning in classic and more recent work in educational theory, art and music, and HCI that emphasize the reconstructive, materially-driven, error-engaged, transgressive, and collaborative nature of human learning processes. It then describes three pedagogical interventions of our own in which improvisational techniques were deployed as methods of teaching and learning. From this integrated study, we report specific pedagogical conditions (socio-material evaluations, multi-sensory practices, and making safe spaces for error) that can support improvisational learning, and three common challenges of HCI pedagogy – relevance, assessment, and inclusion that improvisational methods can help to address.",

      "abstract": "When users on social media share content without considering its veracity, they may unwittingly be spreading misinformation. In this work, we investigate the design of lightweight interventions that nudge users to assess the accuracy of information as they share it. Such assessment may deter users from posting misinformation in the first place, and their assessments may also provide useful guidance to friends aiming to assess those posts themselves. In support of lightweight assessment, we first develop a taxonomy of the reasons why people believe a news claim is or is not true; this taxonomy yields a checklist that can be used at posting time. We conduct evaluations to demonstrate that the checklist is an accurate and comprehensive encapsulation of people's free-response rationales. In a second experiment, we study the effects of three behavioral nudges---1) checkboxes indicating whether headings are accurate, 2) tagging reasons (from our taxonomy) that a post is accurate via a checklist and 3) providing free-text rationales for why a headline is or is not accurate---on people's intention of sharing the headline on social media. From an experiment with 1668 participants, we find that all three nudges reduce the sharing of false content. They also reduce the sharing of true content, but to a lesser degree that yields an overall decrease in the fraction of shared content that is false. Our findings have implications for designing social media and news sharing platforms that draw from richer signals of content credibility contributed by users. In addition, our validated taxonomy can be used by platforms and researchers as a way to gather rationales in an easier fashion than free-response.",

      "abstract": "To improve news literacy and consequently reduce the harm of misinformation, we designed and developed a game that emulates a social media feed. We tracked user interactions with articles from mainstream and low-credibility sources during a 19-month deployment of the game. The game achieved its objective of priming players to be suspicious of questionable content. As players interacted with more articles, they significantly improved their skills in spotting mainstream content, thus confirming the utility of the game for improving news literacy. Semi-structured interviews revealed that the players found the game to be simple, fun and educational. The principles and mechanisms used by the game could serve to inform social media functionality that helps people distinguish between credible and questionable content they encounter in their news feeds.",

      "abstract": "People often prefer to consume news with similar political predispositions and access like-minded news articles, which aggravates polarized clusters known as \"echo chamber\". To mitigate this phenomenon, we propose a computer-aided solution to help combat extreme political polarization. Specifically, we present a framework for reversing or neutralizing the political polarity of news headlines and articles. The framework leverages the attention mechanism of a Transformer-based language model to first identify polar sentences, and then either flip the polarity to the neutral or to the opposite through a GAN network. Tested on the same benchmark dataset, our framework achieves a 3%-10% improvement on the flipping/neutralizing success rate of headlines compared with the current state-of-the-art model. Adding to prior literature, our framework not only flips the polarity of headlines but also extends the task of polarity flipping to full-length articles. Human evaluation results show that our model successfully neutralizes or reverse the polarity of news without reducing readability. We release a large annotated dataset that includes both news headlines and full-length articles with polarity labels and meta-data to be used for future research. Our framework has a potential to be used by, social scientists, content creators and content consumers in the real world.",

      "abstract": "While algorithm audits are growing rapidly in importance and commonality, relatively little scholarly work has gone toward synthesizing prior work and strategizing future research in the area. This systematic literature review aims to fill the gap, following PRISMA guidelines in a review of over 500 English articles that yielded 62 algorithm audit studies. The studies are synthesized and organized primarily by behavior (discrimination, distortion, exploitation, and misjudgement), with codes also provided for domain (e.g. search, vision, advertising, etc.), organization (e.g. Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.), and audit method (e.g. sock puppet, direct scrape, crowdsourcing, etc.). Based on the review, previous audit studies have exposed powerful algorithms exhibiting problematic behavior, such as search algorithms culpable of distortion and advertising algorithms culpable of discrimination. The review also suggests some behaviors, domains, methods, and organizations that call for for future audit attention, such as problematic \"echo chambers\" and other distortion effects from advertising algorithms. The paper concludes by discussing algorithm auditing in the context of other research working toward algorithmic justice.",

      "abstract": "The development of AI applications is a multidisciplinary effort, involving multiple roles collaborating with the AI developers, an umbrella term we use to include data scientists and other AI-adjacent roles on the same team. During these collaborations, there is a knowledge mismatch between AI developers, who are skilled in data science, and external stakeholders who are typically not. This difference leads to communication gaps, and the onus falls on AI developers to explain data science concepts to their collaborators. In this paper, we report on a study including analyses of both interviews with AI developers and artifacts they produced for communication. Using the analytic lens of shared mental models, we report on the types of communication gaps that AI developers face, how AI developers communicate across disciplinary and organizational boundaries, and how they simultaneously manage issues regarding trust and expectations.",

      "abstract": "Investigators in fields such as journalism and law enforcement have long sought the public’s help with investigations. New technologies have also allowed amateur sleuths to lead their own crowdsourced investigations (CIs), that have traditionally only been the purview of expert investigators. These CIs have been faced with mixed results. Through  an ethnographic study at a four-day long co-located event with over 250 attendees, we examine the human infrastructure responsible for enabling the success of an expert-led CI. We find that the experts enabled attendees to generate useful leads; the attendees formed a community around the event; and the victims’ families felt supported. However, the co-located setting, legal structures, and emergent social norms impacted collaborative work practice. We also surface three important tensions for CIs to consider and provide design recommendations to manage these tensions.",

      "abstract": "For people diagnosed with a mental illness, psychiatric hospitalization is one step in a long journey, consisting of clinical recovery such as removal of symptoms, and social reintegration involving resuming social roles and responsibilities, overcoming stigma and self-maintenance of the condition. Both clinical recovery and social reintegration need to go hand-in-hand for the overall well-being of individuals. However, research exploring social media for mental health has considered narrower, disjoint conceptualizations of people with mental illness – either as a patient or as a support-seeker. In this paper, we combine medical records with social media data of 254 consented individuals who have experienced a psychiatric hospitalization to address this gap. Adopting a theory-driven, Gaussian Mixture modeling approach, we provide a taxonomy of six heterogeneous behavioral patterns characterizing peoples’ mental health status transitions around hospitalizations. Then we present an empirically derived framework, based on feedback from clinical researchers, to understand peoples’ trajectories around clinical recovery and social reintegration. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of this taxonomy and the empirical framework, we assess social media signals that are indicative of individuals’ reintegration trajectories post-hospitalization. We discuss the implications of combining peoples’ clinical and social experiences in mental health care and the opportunities this intersection presents to post-discharge support and technology-based interventions for mental health.",

Based on 30 semi-structured interviews focused on players’ usernames, we find through the pseudonyms under which they play, gamers both hide identifying information such as their offline names and addresses while bringing attention to information that is deeply meaningful to them, such as their family nickname or favorite music. By deemphasizing some parts of their identity and by emphasizing others, players not only shape how they are perceived by other gamers, but they also attempt to preclude accidental disclosure of more identifying information. We argue that gamertag practices thus constitute an important form of boundary work through which gamers actively seek to draw lines between their offline and multiple online worlds in the ways that they wish. We argue that gamers use these names to both protect and project aspects of their identities--at times even seeking protection through projection--as a way of addressing their competing desires to both conceal and reveal different aspects of their identities. As boundary work, players’ efforts to carefully protect personally-identifying information and intentionally project personally meaningful information to their communities help them better manage their online identities, relationships with others, and overall data privacy.",

      "abstract": "Music therapists provide critical, evidence-based care to a diverse range of clients. However, despite their active role in empowering individuals affected by disability, stigma, grief, and trauma, music therapists remain understudied by the HCI community. We present the results of a mixed methods study of 10 interviewees and 20 survey respondents in the U.S., all of whom are practicing music therapists. Our results show that music therapists engage in technology-aided practices such as making personalized connections with clients, assisting in identity formation, encouraging musicking (music-making), and preserving legacies. Results also show that music therapists face key challenges such as environmental, societal, and financial constraints, including high workload, lack of awareness of the value of music therapy among the general community, and limited access to secure technologies for remote client care. In light of these challenges, we present a set of design implications for creating future technologies for music therapists. This work diverges from previous studies on music therapy technologies, which focus largely on interventions with music therapy clients, by highlighting the often-neglected perspectives from music therapists.",

      "abstract": "Modern machine learning and computer science conferences are experiencing a surge in the number of submissions that challenges the quality of peer review as the number of competent reviewers is growing at a much slower rate. To curb this trend and reduce the burden on reviewers, several conferences have started encouraging or even requiring authors to declare the previous submission history of their papers. Such initiatives have been met with skepticism among authors, who raise the concern about a potential bias in reviewers' recommendations induced by this information. In this work, we investigate whether reviewers exhibit a bias caused by the knowledge that the submission under review was previously rejected at a similar venue, focusing on a population of novice reviewers who constitute a large fraction of reviewer pool in leading machine learning and computer science conferences. We design and conduct a randomized controlled trial closely replicating the relevant components of the peer-review pipeline with 133 reviewers (master's and junior PhD students of top US universities) writing reviews for 19 papers. The analysis reveals that reviewers indeed become negatively biased when they receive a signal about paper being a resubmission, giving almost 1 point lower overall score on a 10-point Likert item (\\Delta = -0.78,  95% CI = [-1.30, -0.24]) than reviewers who do not receive such a signal. Looking at specific criteria scores (originality, quality, clarity and significance), we observe that novice reviewers tend to underrate quality the most.",

Identity options within these communities range from anonymity to real name. The amount of engagement on Q&A sites and the quality of that engagement on Q&A sites may differ depending on the identity options available. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the amount, the quality of engagement, and different types of identity by analyzing three Q&A sites with different identity policies. We find that highly sensitive questions are more likely to be asked anonymously. Furthermore, allowing anonymity does not affect answer quality and only has a weak, negative indirect effect on engagement. On the other hand, anonymity leads to more trolling. We suggest that online communities provide a way for users to ask highly sensitive questions anonymously paired with moderation mechanisms that can help reduce trolling.",

      "abstract": "Digital technologies have transformed engagement in civic collective action, connecting citizens to more action opportunities than ever before. Civic technologists have mostly focused on mobilizing grassroots collective action by providing cost-effective action opportunities [e.g., 28] and personalized ways to connect to social issues [e.g., 5, 9]. Effective mobilization often requires citizens to deliberate about what collective action to take and how to build political power to achieve policy outcomes. Yet we know little about the deliberative processes that help citizens build motivation, develop policy solutions, and organize power to implement policy change through civic collective action. Furthermore, existing CSCW systems are not designed to help citizens learn complex information, develop the motivation to take action, build voluntary commitment, and effectively link collective action efforts to political mechanisms for implementation. Consequently, my doctoral research aims to develop a design framework for social computing systems that empower citizens to change local policy outcomes through deliberation in civic collective action. In this work, I will contribute a systematic design framework to civic technology researchers for supporting deliberation as the key organizing process in developing and implementing effective local policy solutions. To do so, I will provide an in-depth examination of the learning challenges in getting started with taking political action to advance theories of political participation and contribute an iterative community-based approach for developing the political will necessary to implement policy outcomes democratic deliberation.",

Grandparents must learn to foster social connection with their grandchildren despite language and culture barriers, while grandchildren seek to learn their heritage language and culture to better connect with their grandparents. Educational support tools for this context are sparse as language learning apps are often Eurocentric in design and do not fit in the existing routines of immigrant families. In my research, I design educational tools for marginalized immigration populations, such as apps for learning language, preserving family stories, and sharing culture. I design for people at the margins, which requires interdisciplinary intensive approaches. After providing an overview of my research, I present my ongoing project to build a storytelling tool for immigrant families called CrossRoads. CrossRoads employ human-centered approaches that are better suited for uncovering the needs and practices of marginalized immigrant populations. I design and evaluate a tool that fits within the routines of immigrant grandparents and grandchildren by employing the familiar activity of storytelling. I discuss preliminary findings, and implications of my work in the development of educational technology for supporting marginalized, lifelong learners in casual contexts.",

To capture the changing nature of the information environment, I investigate information practice of arts and crafts hobbyists and their interaction with space and place. My dissertation project is grounded upon the literature on space and place in the broad information science field, regarding space and place both as meaningful social products that serve more than passive containers. Using diary studies and individual interviews, I study the adult hobbyist community without limiting the scope of discussion on where making may take place. In particular, I focus on the character of everyday space‚Äîa space that is not dedicated to support making‚Äîand how people approach and adapt to it during the actual making process. My goal is to gain a holistic understanding of spatiality by probing its influence on creative making. The findings are expected to shed new light on the design of computing technology to afford the making practice in everyday life.",

      "abstract": "My dissertation work investigates the role of experiencing authenticity and inauthenticity in LGBTQ+ people‚Äôs social media behavior. It also asks what sociotechnical factors might support or impede efforts to ‚Äúbe yourself‚Äù on social media. In general, people strive to ‚Äúbe themselves,‚Äù or feel and act authentically. They seek out environments in which they feel they can express themselves and act according to their values, and avoid environments in which they cannot. For LGBTQ+ people, online spaces in which they can be themselves are particularly crucial, both for personal wellbeing and for forming supportive relationships. However, the drive to ‚Äúbe themselves‚Äù is often in tension with the drive to protect themselves from harm. Concerns around privacy and unintended disclosure, harmful experiences with other actors (from both within and without the LGBTQ+ community), and subtle cues embedded in platform design can all contribute to this tension. Through a combination of experimental and deep qualitative research, my dissertation will yield important insight into how marginalized social media users assess and navigate their online environments, and identify opportunities to support vulnerable users.",

Developers of these platforms often advocate for open science on the grounds that it is in keeping with scientific values, specifically referencing Mertonian norms. However, many scientists are agnostic toward open science; as policies and technology enforce the movement‚Äôs aims of sharing openly, they seek to protect the research they view as their own. My dissertation work studies the enactment of open science by a variety of stakeholders in the Open Science Framework (OSF)‚Äîits developers, its users, and also its non-users. Through interviews, trace data collection, and observation of these various populations, I will explore how these stakeholders construct different technologies-in-practice. By taking the OSF not as a given, but as a technology whose purpose and effects are structured by the constraints and resources of its stakeholders, I will unpack the tensions among open science advocates, agnostics, and their use of technology. With these insights, science policy and open systems can be designed to better accommodate the diverse concerns of stakeholders.",

      "abstract": "In January 2019, YouTube announced its platform would exclude potentially harmful content from video recommendations while allowing such videos to remain on the platform. While this step is intended to reduce YouTube's role in propagating such content, the continued availability of links to these videos in other online spaces makes it unclear whether this compromise actually reduces their spread. To assess this impact, we apply interrupted time series models to measure whether different types of YouTube sharing in Twitter and Reddit changed significantly in the eight months around YouTube's announcement. We evaluate video sharing across three curated sets of potentially harmful, anti-social content: a set of conspiracy videos that have been shown to experience reduced recommendations in YouTube, a larger set of videos posted by conspiracy-oriented channels, and a set of videos posted by alternative influence network (AIN) channels. As a control, we also evaluate effects on video sharing in a dataset of videos from mainstream news channels. Results show conspiracy-labeled and AIN videos that have evidence of YouTube's de-recommendation experience a significant decreasing trend in sharing on both Twitter and Reddit. For videos from conspiracy-oriented channels, however, we see no significant effect in Twitter but find a significant increase in the level of conspiracy-channel sharing in Reddit. For mainstream news sharing, we actually see an increase in trend on both platforms, suggesting YouTube's suppression particular content types has a targeted effect. This work therefore finds evidence that reducing exposure to anti-social videos within YouTube, without deleting these videos, has potential pro-social, cross-platform effects in sharing across the information ecosystem. At the same time, increases in the level of conspiracy-channel sharing raise concerns about how content producers are responding to YouTube's changes, and transparency from the platform is needed to evaluate these effects further.",

Focusing on epilepsy awareness and attitudes among stakeholders in elementary schools, I propose studies that will utilize interview, survey, and participatory design methods.

      "abstract": "Problem-Based Learning (PBL) is a popular approach to instruction that supports students to get hands-on training by solving problems. Question Pool websites (QPs) such as LeetCode, Code Chef, and Math Playground help PBL by supplying authentic, diverse, and contextualized questions to students. Nonetheless, empirical findings suggest that 40% to 80% of students registered in QPs drop out in less than two months. This research is the first attempt to understand and predict student dropouts from QPs via exploiting students' engagement moods. Adopting a data-driven approach, we identify five different moods for QP students, which are namely challenge-seeker, subject-seeker, interest-seeker, joy-seeker, and non-seeker. We find that students have collective preferences for answering questions in each engagement mood, and deviation from those preferences increases their probability of dropping out significantly. Last but not least, this paper contributes by introducing a new hybrid machine learning model (we call Dropout-Plus) for predicting student dropouts in QPs. The test results on a popular QP in China, with nearly 10K students, show that Dropout-Plus can exceed the rival algorithms' dropout prediction performance in terms of accuracy, F1-measure, and AUC. We wrap up our work by giving some design suggestions to QP managers and online learning professionals to reduce their student dropouts.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims to understand the educational settings of children with autism (CWA) in the specialized schools of Bangladesh from their parents’ perspective. Sparse research in the same context to understand teachers’ perceptions has been found. Though parents and teachers are an integral part of these children’s educational experience, limited research has been conducted to deeply understand and facilitate parent-teacher relationships to offer CWA an improved learning experience in Bangladesh. Our in-depth qualitative study on urban parents (N=10) showed current challenges and opportunities relating to the schools designed for CWA. The work takes a close look at the existing concerns and confirms that parent-teacher communication in special schools here is not a straightforward one because of other complicated interferences (e.g., social and familial stigma, lack of transparency from administrators, insufficient qualified teachers) as felt by the parents. Nevertheless, the remarkable coverage of cellular networks and increasing usage of mobile phones in Bangladesh places us in a unique position to expect positive changes by employing ICT, which we believe will open avenues for future researchers and guide them in implementing robust technology to support an improved learning environment for the CWA and their families.",

      "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in CSCW and HCI to understand the experiences of programmers in the workplace. However, the large majority of these studies have focused on sighted programmers and as a result, the experiences of programmers with visual impairments in professional contexts remain understudied. We address this gap by reporting on findings from semi-structured interviews with 22 programmers with visual impairments. We found that programmers with visual impairments interact with a complex ecosystem of tools and a significant part of their job entails performing work to overcome the accessibility challenges inherent in this ecosystem. Furthermore, we found that the visual nature of various programming activities impedes collaboration, which necessitates the co-creation of new work practices through a series of sociotechnical interactions. These sociotechnical interactions often required invisible work and articulation work on the part of the programmers with visual impairments.",

      "abstract": "People frequently turn to online spaces to debate ideas and discuss interpersonal issues, however these online interactions more often polarize people and damage relationships than their offline equivalencies. This raises the question: how does designs support or undermine users during online arguments? We conducted a three-phase study, including interviews, a survey, and a storyboard design evaluation with 257 total participants to learn about their experiences arguing online and how design shapes this experience. We found that participants want to have hard conversations online more often than they do today. Participants said that certain designs, like easily moving to a more private channel, make constructive arguments more feasible. Other features inhibit hard conversations, such as interfaces that hide comments. We then evaluated 12 novel user-driven designs to support constructive arguments, which revealed a common set of perceived benefits and risks. We contribute empirical data about users' current experiences arguing online and a set of design approaches--and their attendent risks and benefits--to support users in arguing well.",

We performed a qualitative study involving interviews with 21 delivery workers in Bangalore, India to understand how workers experienced and responded to social isolation perpetuated by the nature of their jobs. We found that the stigma and individual nature of app-based delivery work restricts access to inter-relational and instrumental support. As a response, workers organized peer networks for both companionship and emergency assistance. We analyze how the cultural context of India heightens these experiences, and offer ideas for mitigating the risks of isolation as a result of gig work.",

      "abstract": "Older adults are often portrayed as passive social media users who consume content rather than actively posting content. However, this binary divide between active and passive social media use overlooks nuanced kinds of engagement online. Via an eye-tracking study of older adults' Facebook use, this work shows how not clicking or commenting on content can involve engaged kinds of social media use even if they are not visible to other users or to the platform. Older adults' decisions to not actively click or comment on social media content---an act which is often associated with non-engagement---can be intentional and relational acts of caregiving. We draw from feminist care theories to draw parallels between the invisibility of care work that older adults do on social media and the invisibility often rendered in their offline lives. We discuss theoretical, methodological, and design implications for supporting older adults as engaged participants in relational and intentional care work.",

      "abstract": "Telerehabilitation technology has the potential to support the work of patients and clinicians by collecting and displaying patients' data to inform, motivate, and support decision-making. However, few studies have investigated data-driven practices in telerehabilitation. In this qualitative study, we conducted interviews and a focus group with the use of data visualization probes to investigate the experience of stroke survivors and healthcare providers with game-based telerehabilitation involving physical and occupational therapy. We find that participants saw potential value in the data to support their work, however they experienced challenges when interpreting data to arrive at meaningful insights and actionable information. Further, patients' personal relationships with their goals and data stand in contrast with clinicians' more matter-of-fact perspectives. Informed by these results, we discuss implications for telerehabilitation technology design.",

      "abstract": "Social platforms hold great promise for supporting marginalized communities, such as the LGBTQ+ community, yet they are frequently sites of further stigmatization and harm. By engaging a diverse sample of 31 US LGBTQ+ users in five qualitative, design-based value elicitation exercises, we find that misalignments between perceived platform values and the values of the marginalized users they serve are at the heart of this disconnect. We inductively identify two community-based design values for supporting LGBTQ+ users: self-determination and inclusion. These values can be used as design heuristics for both improving existing platforms as well as guiding future new platform development. Based on participant feedback, we provide directions for enacting these values to better align platform values with this marginalized population’s needs.",

However, the work and the issues frontline health workers face in community health are often invisible, with limited resources to assist them. This study explores the work practices, challenges and roles of frontline health workers in community health with particular focus on pregnancy care in South India. Drawing on the notion of maintenance and articulation work, we describe the maintenance work of frontline health workers maintaining, anticipating, navigating, reconciling, and supporting care infrastructures beyond data collection practices. Our findings also highlight how socio-cultural practices, perceptions, status, and existing systems influence maintenance work practices. Based on our findings, we suggest moving beyond the focus on training and performance to design CSCW tools to support the maintenance work that frontline health workers do to make healthcare infrastructures work in community health.",

To address this, we demonstrate CiteAs, a system designed to improve incentives for high-quality software work by altering citation behaviors in the loosely governed sociotechnical system producing research software. CiteAs has two goals: first, to encourage those producing research software to make clear requests for citations most valuable to them; and second, to encourage users of research software to cite software more and follow the citations requested by the developer. CiteAs is implemented as a specialized search engine at https://citeas.org/ that explains itself and instructs better practices. Ultimately we hope that CiteAs will increase the visibility of research software, improving incentives for the software work needed to advance research.",

The game revolves around four roles delivering their duties, by following safety measures and collaboratively clearing multiple stages in the game. We evaluated the game through a qualitative and quantitative user survey, that presented encouraging results, with volunteers expressing increased empathy towards efforts of individuals with varied professional backgrounds, and better understanding of the importance of safety measures against Covid-19.We see that this work could provide insights to the CSCW audience on using collaborative games towards bringing awareness in the context of pandemics.",

However, most multi-dimensional conceptualizations were developed based on populations from western countries. It remains an open question whether the underlying dimensions of privacy stays consistent in non-western countries. Through a series of factor analyses on two survey datasets, we compare the dimensions of privacy concern, information disclosure, general disclosiveness, and privacy management strategies among social network users in the US, China and South Korea. We find significant cross-country differences in the dimensions of these privacy-related concepts, indicating that the fundamental understanding of these concepts varies substantially across these countries. We discuss possible explanations of these cross-country differences and make methodological suggestions for future work.",

      "abstract": "Receiving feedback on preliminary work allows content creators to gain insight and improve outcomes. However, evaluation apprehension can delay feedback seeking. In this paper, we operationalize goal setting theory for planning feedback goals. In an online experiment, participants (N=245) wrote an initial story after planning feedback goals (or not), submitted the story for feedback when desired, and revised the story based on the feedback received. Participants perceived the feedback came from a supervisor or peer to induce different levels of evaluation apprehension. We found that participants who wrote proximal feedback goals sought feedback when their stories were less developed and revised the stories more after receiving feedback compared to when they wrote distant goals. Participants who anticipated feedback from a supervisor in addition to planning a feedback goal revised their work more than participants in the other conditions. Planning feedback goals did not affect evaluation apprehension. These results indicate that instructors and tools should guide content creators to plan proximal feedback goals to encourage sharing early drafts of creative work and provide feedback from someone in a position of higher perceived power (e.g., supervisor) to foster revision.",

      "abstract": "As an emerging business phenomena especially in China, instant messaging (IM) based social commerce is growing increasingly popular, attracting hundreds of millions of users and is becoming one primary way where people make everyday purchase. Such platforms embed shopping experiences within IM apps (e.g. WeChat, WhatsApp), where real world friends post and recommend products from the platform in IM group chats. and quite often form lasting recommending/buying relationship. How and why do users engage on instant messaging based social commerce? Do such platforms create novel shopping experience that is distinct from traditional commerce? And do these platforms bring changes to user social lives and relationship? To shed light on these questions, we launched a qualitative study where we carried out semi-structured interviews on 12 instant messaging based social commerce users in China. We showed that IM based social commerce 1) enables more accessible, cost-reducing and ubiquitous user shopping experience, 2) shape user decision making process in shopping through pre-existing social relationship, mutual trust, shared identity and community norm, and 3) create novel social interactions, which can positvely/negatively influence social relationship. We demonstrate that all these unique aspects of IM based social commerce link closely to the coupling of user social and economic lives on the platform. Our study provides important research and design implications for social commerce design and CSCW applications in general.",

      "abstract": "As the use of algorithmic systems in high-stakes decision-making increases, the ability to contest algorithmic decisions is being recognised as an important safeguard for individuals. Yet, there is little guidance on what `contestability'--the ability to contest decisions--in relation to algorithmic decision-making requires. Recent research presents different conceptualisations of  contestability in algorithmic decision-making. We contribute to this growing body of work by describing and analysing the perspectives of people and organisations who made submissions in response to Australia's proposed `AI Ethics Framework', the first framework of its kind to include `contestability' as a core ethical principle. Our findings reveal that while the nature of contestability is disputed, it is seen as a way to protect individuals, and it resembles contestability in relation to human decision-making. We analyse and consider the implications of these findings.",

      "abstract": "Shift scheduling strongly impacts the job satisfaction and well-being of healthcare workers, because it heavily influences social life and recreational activities. Due to its complexity and time-consuming nature, shift scheduling becomes increasingly automated. However, existing systems are mostly directed at improving efficiency. The workers' needs and their participation in negotiating shifts do not play a pronounced role. In contrast, we present a nine month case study of an interactive, worker-centered self-scheduling system which allows healthcare workers to participate in shift planning and to negotiate scheduling conflicts autonomously. Our results show that cautiousness about social standing and differences in personal lifestyle inhibited system usage for some workers. Moreover, the workers engaged in several pro-social conflict prevention strategies instead of competitive decision-making. We conclude the paper with detailed design guidelines for computer-supported self-scheduling.",

      "abstract": "A primary goal of remote collaboration tools is to provide the most effective meetings possible for all meeting participants. To study meeting effectiveness and meeting inclusiveness, we first conducted a large scale email survey (N=4,425) at a large technology company (pre-COVID-19); using this data we derived a multivariate model of meeting effectiveness and show how it correlates with meeting inclusiveness, participation, and feeling comfortable to contribute. We believe this is the first such model of meeting effectiveness and inclusiveness. The model shows the following factors are correlated with inclusiveness, effectiveness, participation, and feeling comfortable to contribute in meetings: Sending a pre-meeting communication, sending a post-meeting summary, including a meeting agenda, attendee location, remote-only meeting, audio/video quality and reliability, video usage, and meeting size. The model and survey results give a quantitative understanding of how and where to improve meeting effectiveness and inclusiveness and what the potential returns are.  Motivated by the email survey results, we implemented a post-meeting survey into a leading computer-mediated communication (CMC) system to directly measure meeting effectiveness and inclusiveness (during COVID-19). Using initial results based on internal flighting we are able to create a similar model of effectiveness and inclusiveness, with many of the same findings as the email survey. This shows a method of measuring these metrics which is both practical and useful in a commercial CMC system.",

      "abstract": "We describe a mobile app for helping people manage their mental health, keeping in mind the unique challenges offered by the Indian context. One of the biggest challenges in India is the stigma around mental health and consequently the concerns and misconceptions about reaching out for professional help. Therefore, the proposed app focuses on tackling the barriers that people experience when reaching out for help and provides a free-of-cost platform for interactions with mental health professionals to alleviate any concerns and obtain an informed view. All content is developed by clinical psychologists and rather than replacing professional help, the app provides an example of a technology intervention for mental health that supplements existing infrastructures of mental healthcare.",

      "abstract": "Accessibility assessments typically focus on determining a binary measurement of task performance success/failure, and often neglect to acknowledge the nuances of those interactions. Although a large population of blind people find smartphone interactions possible, many experiences take a significant toll and can have a lasting negative impact on the individual and their willingness to step out of technological comfort zones. There is a need to assist and support individuals with the adoption and learning process of new tasks to mitigate these negative experiences. We contribute with a human-powered nonvisual task assistant for smartphones to provide pervasive assistance. We argue, in addition to success, one must carefully consider promoting and evaluating factors such as self-efficacy and the belief in one's abilities to control and learn to use technology. In this paper, we show effective assistant positively affects self-efficacy when performing new tasks with smartphones, affects perceptions of accessibility and enables systemic task-based learning.",

      "abstract": "Preparing a new dance performance involves more than asking dancers to learn individual steps. We are interested in understanding how dancers collaborate as they rehearse a new dance piece, with a particular emphasis on how they use physical and digital artifacts to support this process. We conducted a 12-month longitudinal observation study with a dance company that re-staged a dance piece, taken from the contemporary repertoire and unknown to the dancers. This study focuses on the role that artifacts, used during the rehearsal process, play in shaping learning. We show how dancers produced an ecology of artifacts with the aim of distributing their knowledge and sharing it with other learners. We show how artifacts serve to decompose the choreography into simpler components, independent and complementary, with the objective to reduce the difficulty of the learning task. We found that dancers compile artifacts to create a common structure among the group, allowing for improving the learning process. We conclude with design opportunities for technologies supporting long-term dance learning processes.",

      "abstract": "Machines, from artificially intelligent digital assistants to embodied robots, are becoming more pervasive in everyday life. Drawing on feminist science and technology studies (STS) perspectives, we demonstrate how machine designers are not just crafting neutral objects, but relationships between machines and humans that are entangled in human social issues such as gender and power dynamics. Thus, in order to create a more ethical and just future, the dominant assumptions currently underpinning the design of these human-machine relations must be challenged and reoriented toward relations of justice and inclusivity. This paper contributes the “social machine” as a model for technology designers who seek to recognize the importance, diversity and complexity of the social in their work, and to engage with the agential power of machines. In our model, the social machine is imagined as a potentially equitable relationship partner that has agency and as an “other” that is distinct from, yet related to, humans, objects, and animals. We critically examine and contrast our model with tendencies in robotics that consider robots as tools, human companions, animals or creatures, and/or slaves. In doing so, we demonstrate ingrained dominant assumptions about human-machine relations and reveal the challenges of radical thinking in the social machine design space. Finally, we present two design challenges based on non-anthropomorphic figuration and mutuality, and call for experimentation, unlearning dominant tendencies, and reimagining of sociotechnical futures.",

      "abstract": "The growing popularity of online fundraising (aka “crowdfunding”) has attracted significant research on the subject. In contrast to previous studies that attempt to predict the success of crowdfunded projects based on specific characteristics of the projects and their creators, we present a more general approach that focuses on crowd dynamics and is robust to the particularities of different crowdfunding platforms. We rely on a multi-level analysis to investigate the correlates, predictive importance, and quasi-causal effects of features that describe crowd dynamics in determining the success of crowdfunded projects. By applying a multi-level analysis to a study of fundraising in three different online markets, we uncover general crowd dynamics that ultimately decide which projects will succeed. In all levels of analysis and across the three different platforms, we consistently find that funders’ behavioural signals (1) are significantly correlated with fundraising success;(2) approximate fundraising outcomes better than the characteristics of projects and their creators such as credit grade, company valuation, and subject domain; and (3) have significant quasi-causal effects on fundraising outcomes while controlling for potentially confounding project variables. By showing that universal features deduced from crowd behaviour are predictive of fundraising success on different crowdfunding platforms, our work provides design-relevant insights about novel types of collective decision-making online. This research inspires thus potential ways to leverage cues from the crowd and catalyses research into crowd-aware system design.",

      "abstract": "Bulk email is a primary communication channel within organizations, with all-company messages and regular newsletters serving as a mechanism for making employees aware of policies, events, and other needed messages. Ineffective communication could result in substantial wasted employee time and lack of awareness or compliance. Previous studies on organizational emails focused mostly on recipients. However, organizational bulk email systems are a multi-stakeholder problem including recipients, communicators, and organization itself. Thus we study the effectiveness, experience, practice, and assessments of organizational bulk email systems from different stakeholders' perspectives. We conducted a quantitative study within a large organization to understand the extent to which the recipients retained the messages from the organizational bulk emails they received. We conducted a qualitative study with communicators and recipients within the organization. We delved into the bulk email distributing mechanisms of the communicators, the reading behaviors of recipients, and the bulk emails' values from communicators and recipients' points of view. We found that the recipients were not retaining most of the messages from the bulk emails though they opened a large number of them. The tools for designing and distributing organizational bulk email for communicators were very limited. The assessments on bulk emails' values and effectiveness were different between communicators and recipients.  We discussed possible solutions that could improve organizational bulk emails' designing and distributing mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "The presence of people in an urban area throughout the day -- often called `urban vitality' -- is one of the qualities world-class cities aspire to the most, yet it is one of the hardest to achieve. Back in the 1970s, Jane Jacobs theorized urban vitality and found that there are four conditions required for the promotion of life in cities: diversity of land use, small block sizes, the mix of economic activities, and concentration of people. To build proxies for those four conditions and ultimately test Jane Jacobs's theory at scale, researchers have had to collect both private and public data from a variety of sources, and that took decades. Here we propose the use of one single source of data, which happens to be publicly available: Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. In particular, since the first two conditions (diversity of land use and small block sizes) are visible to the naked eye from satellite imagery, we tested whether we could automatically extract them with a state-of-the-art deep-learning framework and whether, in the end, the extracted features could predict vitality. In six Italian cities for which we had call data records, we found that our framework is able to explain up to 55\\% of the variance in urban vitality extracted from those records.",

This paper introduces Adjacent Display of Relevant Discussion (ADRD): it places discussion in a panel adjacent to the video and dynamically updates the content of the panel based on the current time of the video. In a between-subjects lab study (N=20), ADRD helped users resolve more points of confusion, skim and read more discussion comments, and engage more with the video.",

      "abstract": "A growing number of people are using catch-up TV services rather than watching simultaneously with other audience members at the time of broadcast. However, computational support for such catching-up users has not been well explored. In particular, we are observing an emerging phenomenon in online media consumption experiences in which speculation plays a vital role. As the phenomenon of speculation implicitly assumes simultaneity in media consumption, there is a gap for catching-up users, who cannot directly appreciate the consumption experiences. This conversely suggests that there is potential for computational support to enhance the consumption experiences of catching-up users. Accordingly, we conducted a series of studies to pave the way for developing computational support for catching-up users. First, we conducted semi-structured interviews to understand how people are engaging with speculation during media consumption. As a result, we discovered the distinctive aspects of speculation-based consumption experiences in contrast to previously-discussed social viewing experiences through sharing immediate reactions. We then designed two prototypes for supporting catching-up users based on our quantitative analysis of Twitter data in regard to reaction- and speculation-based media consumption. Lastly, we evaluated them in a user study and, based on its results, discussed ways to empower catching-up users with the support of computers in response to recent transformations in media consumption.",

      "abstract": "Language and cultural barriers critically threaten the social relationships between grandparents and grandchildren in immigrant families. Cultural exchange activities, like shared storytelling, can foster these crucial connections. However, existing barriers make these seemingly routine interactions challenging for families to navigate. The resulting intergenerational drift places grandparents at high risk of sustained social isolation from their families. Past works have presented technology-mediated supports for grandparent-grandchild social interactions in non-immigrant families and have found that these interventions do foster stronger connections in both physically close and distant multigenerational families. We explore how to support the specific needs of immigrant families through Magic Thing participatory design workshops with grandchildren and grandparents together in order to reveal the social interactions that would support their cultural exchange. We use the Magic Thing to move the standard dialogic grandparent-grandchild relationship into a trialogic one, creating space for comfortable social connection and storytelling through the shared creation of the design. We find that technology-mediated support of intergenerational immigrant cultural exchange must be designed for this trialogic process, consider the role of expressing values as a form of meta-commentary on a story, and shift the perspective on existing “barriers” to consider how they might foster further engagement.",

      "abstract": "One of the grand challenges of artificial intelligence and affective computing is for technology to become emotionally-aware and thus, more human-like. Modeling human emotions is particularly complicated when we consider the lived experiences of people who are on the autism spectrum. To understand the emotional experiences of autistic adults and their attitudes towards common representations of emotions, we deployed a context study as the first phase of a Grounded Design research project. Based on community observations and interviews, this work contributes empirical evidence of how the emotional experiences of autistic adults are entangled with social interactions as well as the processing of sensory inputs. We learned that (1) the emotional experiences of autistic adults are embodied and co-constructed within the context of physical environments, social relationships, and technology use, and (2) conventional approaches to visually representing emotion in affective education and computing systems fail to accurately represent the experiences and perceptions of autistic adults. We contribute a social-emotional-sensory design map to guide designers in creating more diverse and nuanced affective computing interfaces that are enriched by accounting for neurodivergent users.",

While design ethics is a well-established research area, few studies have enquired into how design practitioners understand ethics. Through semi-structured interviews we have explored practitioners’ approaches to ethics in design. Our findings show noticing, reflecting and reacting as three ways that ethical matters are approached. This ties into dynamic and participatory views on ethics, rather than viewing ethics as a set of formal frameworks and deductive reasoning practices. Practitioners need approaches that tie in to existing work practices. Our results provide practice-led suggestions and points of departure of when and how it might be suitable to infuse design ethics into design practice.",

      "abstract": "Online community moderators often rely on social signals like whether or not a user has an account or a profile page as clues that users are likely to cause problems. Reliance on these clues may lead to ``over-profiling'' bias when moderators focus on these signals but overlook misbehavior by others. We propose that algorithmic flagging systems deployed to improve efficiency of moderation work can also make moderation actions more fair to these users by reducing reliance on social signals and making norm violations by everyone else more visible. We analyze moderator behavior in Wikipedia as mediated by a system called RCFilters that displays social signals and algorithmic flags and estimate the causal effect of being flagged on moderator actions.  We show that algorithmically flagged edits are reverted more often, especially edits by established editors with positive social signals, and that flagging decreases the likelihood that moderation actions will be undone. Our results suggest that algorithmic flagging systems can lead to increased fairness but that the relationship is complex and contingent.",

      "abstract": "Unlike in commercial software development, open source software (OSS) projects do not generally have managers with direct control over how developers spend their time, yet for projects with large, diverse sets of contributors, the need exists to focus and steer development in a particular direction in a coordinated way. This is especially important for “infrastructure” projects, such as critical libraries and programming languages that many other people depend on. Some projects have taken the approach of borrowing planning tools that originated in commercial development, despite the fact that these techniques were designed for very different contexts, e.g. strong top-down control and pro￿t motives. Little research has been done to understand how these practices are adapted to a new context. In this paper, we examine the Rust project’s use of roadmaps: how has an important OSS infrastructure project adapted an inherently top-down tool to the freewheeling world of OSS? We find that because Rust’s roadmaps are built in part by summarizing what motivated developers most prefer to work on, they are in some ways more a description of the motivated labor available than they are a directive that the community move in a particular direction. They allow the community to avoid wasting time on unpopular proposals by revealing that there will be little help in building them, and encouraging work on popular features by making visible the amount of consensus in those features. Roadmaps generate a collective focus without limiting the full scope of what developers work on: roadmap issues consume proportionally more effort than other issues, but constitute a minority of the work done (i.e issues and pull requests made) by both central and peripheral participants. They also create transparency among and beyond the community into what central contributors’ plans are, and allow more rational decision-making by providing a way for evidence about community needs to be linked to decision-making.",

      "abstract": "There are over three million people living with epilepsy in the U.S. People with epilepsy experience multiple daily challenges such as seizures, social isolation, social stigma, experience of physical and emotional symptoms, medication side effects, cognitive and memory deficits, care coordination difficulties, and risks of sudden unexpected death. In this work, we report findings collected from 3 focus groups of 11 people with epilepsy and caregivers and 10 follow-up questionnaires. We found that these participants feel that most people do not know how to deal with seizures. To improve others' abilities to respond safely and appropriately to someone having seizures, people with epilepsy and caregivers would like to share and educate the public about their epilepsy conditions, reduce common misconceptions about seizures and prevent associated stigma, and get first aid help from the public when needed. Considering social stigma, we propose design implications of future technologies for effective delivery of appropriate first aid care information to bystanders around individuals with epilepsy when they experience a seizure.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning has become pervasive in modern interactive technology due to the wide range of complex tasks it can handle. However, most machine learning systems provide users with surprisingly little, if any, agency with respect to how their models are trained from data. In this paper, we explore the way people could handle learning algorithms, what they understand from their behavior and what strategy they may use to “make it work”. To address these questions, we developed an web-based sketch-based recognition algorithm, called Marcelle-Sketch, that end-users can teach. We present two experimental studies that investigate people's strategies, beliefs and (mis)understandings in a realistic algorithm-teaching task. Study one took place in online workshop that collected drawing data from 22 novice users and analyzed their teaching strategies. Study two involved eight participants who performed a similar task during individual teaching sessions, using a think-aloud protocol. Our results show that users have different inputs scheduling. Their strategy incorporate investigations of the model's capabilities using input variability, driving changes in users understanding of machine learning during the session.We conclude with implications for the design of richer, more human-centered forms of interactions with machine learning, and impact for ML education and democratization.",

      "abstract": "To understand the lived experience of how people with disabilities telework, 25 people were interviewed. The participants included people who are blind or low vision, deaf or hard of hearing, neurodiverse, have limited mobility/dexterity, and have chronic health issues. The interviews focused on how they used video calling, screen sharing, and collaborative editing technologies to accomplish their telework. The interviews found ways in which design choices made in telework technologies interact with people’s abilities, especially those who are blind or low vision, since the tools rely heavily on the visual channel to enable remote collaboration. A central theme emerged around how design choices made in telework technologies affect the digital representation of people’s online activities in the video call interface: those who turn off their video (because they are blind or do not want to expend the cognitive effort to present themselves over video) are relegated to a blank rectangular frame with their name; those who are deaf and speak through a sign language interpreter never show up in interfaces that use active speaker detection to choose which video streams to display. Users with disabilities may avoid using screen sharing and collaborative editing tools which “leak” cues that disclose their disabilities. Because the interviews were conducted during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic response, they also provide a preview of how the sudden shift to pervasive teleworking affected their telework experience.",

      "abstract": "Extremely impoverished people (known as Beggars or Homeless, depending on where they live), are a group of vulnerable citizens that are deprived of necessary healthcare support,  consequences of which can be minor to severe, and in some cases, fatal. Bangladesh, having a significant number of them, is no different. One noticeable difference of these beggars compared to similar communities in other parts of the world (e.g., homeless people in the USA) is that technology penetration is near-to-zero for beggars in Bangladesh, which we confirm through our field study. Thus, technology-based (such as app-based, mHealth, etc.) solutions for providing healthcare support, which maybe possible in advanced countries, is not possible in lower-income countries like Bangladesh. However, there does exist multiple healthcare services in Bangladesh intended for beggars and similar communities, which mostly remain underused by the intended population. This scenario presents a unique challenge, where there is a geographical gap between healthcare services and their intended recipients (beggars in our context). We tackle this problem through a carefully-crafted solution Dakter Bari (meaning ``Home of a doctor\" in English), that is tailored to the application ecosystem in this context. We extract critical insights from our field study with (N=70) beggars, and from findings, create a pathway for availing lower-cost healthcare solutions using intermediaries. We also conduct field studies with (N=71) possible intermediary partners and (N=10) hospitals to identify the challenges and possibilities of such intermediary based solutions. With insights gained through these field studies, we then design, iteratively develop, deploy, and user-test such a solution in real cases. To penetrate the system further, we design and deploy posters that are easy to understand for the beggar community and report the findings from the system usage data. The usage of the system for more than six months registers 255 service requests and demonstrates its efficacy in bridging the gap we identified through our study.",

      "abstract": "The notion of \"independence\" is frequently used to motivate technology design in the HCI sub-field of accessible and assistive technology for people with disabilities. Despite the term's pervasive use, the literature lacks a recent articulation of its meaning in the context of assistive technology. What does independence really mean? Scoping the study to people with visual impairments (PVI), we posed this question to 10 individuals from diverse backgrounds through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Our findings reveal that PVI have internal experiences of independence and social experiences of independence, with surprising insights into the roles that people and technology play in supporting independence. We also discuss new ways to design for independence.",

      "abstract": "Air pollution is a global challenge for cities across the globe. Understanding the public perception of air pollution can help policymakers engage better with the public and appropriately introduce policies. Accurate public perception can also help people to identify the health risks of air pollution and act accordingly. Unfortunately, current techniques for determining perception are not scalable: it involves surveying few hundred people with questionnaire-based surveys. Using the advances in natural language processing (NLP), we propose a more scalable solution called Vartalaap (which means Conversation in Hindi Langauge) to gauge public perception of air pollution via the microblogging social network Twitter. We used more than 2.2M tweets on Delhi, India, from a 7.3M tweet dataset, which we curated for air pollution perception studies. We find that (unfortunately) the public is supportive of unproven mitigation strategies to reduce pollution, thus risking their health due to a false sense of security. We also find that air quality is a year-long problem, but the discussions are not proportional to the level of pollution and spike up when pollution is more visible. The information required by Vartalaap is publicly available and, as such, it can be immediately applied to study different societal issues across the world.",

      "abstract": "Despite sharing economy’s highly touted promise of a novel, inclusive and community building model of responsible production and consumption, sharing economy has been indicted for profiteering from previously private and occasionally non-monetized activities, creating precarious jobs and reproducing stereotypes. In the epicenter of such critiques are the ‘big’ and ‘limelight-ed’ platform firms, like AirBnB and Uber and the digital infrastructures they employ. Similarly, and to the best of our knowledge, the majority of related research focuses on SE platforms of this ilk. In response, while acknowledging that the problem is not the agency of the digital in the activity of sharing per se, but that the wrong people set the terms and benefit from this mediation, we find it timely to explore the existence of more self-organized and community-driven SE initiatives and explore how they use the digital to support their sharing ends. As a result, in this paper we report from our engagement with a community-run, self-organized ride-sharing initiative, called ‘Share the ride ;)’. ‘Share the ride ;)’ operates within a Facebook group since 2009 and is the most popular ride-sharing ‘platform’ in Greece. Extrapolating from our findings and while adopting a ‘Solidarity HCI’ approach, we participate in the ‘sharing discourse’ by providing design implications for the development of ‘Solidarity Sharing Economy Platforms’. We perceive those, as digital infrastructures which can favor self-organization and pluralism and which are developed for communities (existing and new ones) in order to facilitate multiple sharing activities and nurture a generative sharing ideology. To that end, we suggest malleability as a design affordance and the development of mechanisms which aim at supporting the formulation of enduring social ties among those platforms’ members. Finally, we underscore that in order to favor the establishment of strong relations, ‘Solidarity SEPs’ should avoid normalizing designs and on the contrary employ architectures which esteem pluralism and self-affirmation.",

      "abstract": "Effective ways to measure employee job satisfaction are fraught with problems of scale, misrepresentation, and timeliness. Current methodologies are limited in capturing subjective differences in expectations, needs, and values at work, and they do not lay emphasis on demographic differences, which may vary people’s perceptions of job satisfaction. This study proposes an approach to assess job satisfaction by leveraging large-scale social media data. Starting with an initial Twitter dataset of 1.5M posts, we examine two facets of job satisfaction, pay and supervision. By adopting a theory-driven approach, we first build machine learning classifiers to assess perceived job satisfaction with an average AUC of 0.84. We then study demographic differences in perceived job satisfaction by geography, sex, and race in the U.S. For geography, we find that job satisfaction on Twitter exhibits insightful relationships with macroeconomic indicators such as financial wellbeing and unemployment rates. For sex and race, we find that females express greater pay satisfaction but lower supervision satisfaction than males, whereas Whites express the least pay and supervision satisfaction. Unpacking linguistic differences, we find contrasts in different groups’ underlying priorities and concerns, e.g., under-represented groups saliently express about basic livelihood, whereas the majority groups saliently express about self-actualization. We discuss the role of frame of reference and the “job satisfaction paradox”, conceptualized by organizational psychologists, in explaining our observed differences. We conclude with theoretical and sociotechnical implications of our work for understanding and improving worker wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Techlash encapsulates a breaking point reached with the critique of technology companies. To investigate how this whirlwind of rage, inquiry, and accountability affects the lives of tech workers, we conducted interviews with 19 tech workers. Our methodological approach adopts a style of writing and analysis associated with anthropologist Kathleen Stewart, where we focus on the affective textures of critique in an attempt to redirect the temptation to representational thinking to a slowed ethnographic practice. Through this approach, we find that emotional habitus, a social group's emotional dispositions honed by tech culture's rationality and optimism, conditions the possibilities of personal and political action and inaction in response to critique. We suggest this habitus must shift if people are to access new ways of emoting and thereby adopt more fruitful attitudes and exercise towards critique.",

      "abstract": "The construct of “situational awareness” (SA) has a rich and productive history within both academic literature and practice. Situational awareness as a technical term has its earliest roots in formative human factors research in service of military and flight applications.  However, its value as a construct in other domains, particularly those having to do with rapid sensemaking in safety-sensitive conditions, has led to a broader applied and theoretical interest over the past few decades. As a discipline, CSCW has been relatively less engaged with this concept, but has empirical and theoretical tools that will be valuable to its study. To bring CSCW more fully into the conversation, we present a description of how operators in a city department of transportation’s transportation management center (TMC) develop and maintain situational awareness for themselves and the key recipients of their critical information outputs. We identify some of the schemas operators must develop in order to effectively construct situational awareness and dynamically articulate common fields of work, and the social collaborative practices they engage in to support that awareness.  Implications for design and further research are proposed.",

      "abstract": "Social media platforms have been exploited to conduct election interference in recent years. In particular, the Russian-backed Internet Research Agency (IRA) has been identified as a key source of misinformation spread on Twitter prior to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The goal of this research is to understand whether general Twitter users changed their behavior in the year following first contact from an IRA account. We compare the before and after behavior of contacted users to determine whether there were differences in their mean tweet count, the sentiment of their tweets, and the frequency and sentiment of tweets mentioning@realDonaldTrump or @HillaryClinton. Our results indicate that users overall exhibited statistically significant changes in behavior across most of these metrics, and that those users that engaged with the IRA generally showed greater changes in behavior.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes how village-level officials, relatively new to the Internet, use  popular digital platforms on smartphones to supplement and extend long-standing patterns of information control and authoritarian power in rural Cambodia. They use these tools to monitor local affairs, report to the central government, and promote local government activities, practices which intimidate villagers and encourage their political withdrawal and self-censorship. This paper makes three contributions to the literature on networked authoritarianism and rural governance. First, technological changes currently underway in the Cambodian rural bureaucracy reflect a generational transition, as long-standing officials struggle to use new media easily or effectively, leading to new anxieties and breakdowns for these traditional holders of power. Second, bureaucratic information practices in these villages rely on material practices ranging from paper, face to face meetings, and loudspeakers, to new tools such as Facebook and smartphones - underlining significant continuities in mechanisms of bureaucratic power and control. Third, networked authoritarian practices conjure for villagers the historical links between information control and violence, and the effectiveness of these tactics on chilling speech is often rooted in villagers' memories of fear.",

While prior work has shown that social media platforms enable its users to safely share their turmoils, hardships, and emotional upheavals and seek support, little is known about how the unemployed use such platforms. Based on a qualitative analysis of data retrieved from unemployment communities on Reddit, our study reveals that redditors on these communities engage in exchanges that range from queries seeking information about job searching to discussions about sensitive topics such as the health and social implications of unemployment. Also, while redditors use mostly negative emotional tonality in their texts when initiating a new post, the comments in response provide considerable social support in form of esteem, emotional, informational, network, and instrumental support. Based on these findings, we share the theoretical implications of our work and offer design recommendation.",

      "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a worldwide public health crisis. In such times of crisis, access to relevant and accurate information is critical. For many people in China, domestic social media platforms such as WeChat and Weibo have become dominant sources of COVID-19-related information and news. On these platforms, government censorship policies, astroturfers, and other government interventions have contributed to an increasingly complex social media environment. People have to evaluate the trustworthiness of COVID-19-related information and make sharing decisions in such a complex environment. We conducted interviews with 33 Chinese WeChat users to understand how individuals were seeking COVID-19-related information and how they identified and evaluated specific COVID-19-related misinformation. This work exposes that COVID-19-related content with ‘positive energy’ is prevalent on social media in China. A significant number of interviewees exhibited a willingness to prioritize information valence over veracity when evaluating and sharing content with others. Further, the work revealed that Chinese citizens’ understanding of information ecosystems plays an important role in their attitudes towards censorship and official media, and their evaluation of both domestic and international information during the global crisis.",

      "abstract": "Research has shown study habits and skills to be correlated with academic success, calling for a deeper comprehension of these behaviors and processes to design effective interventions for struggling students. Chatbots have recently been used as a persuasive technology to help support behavioral change, making them an intriguing design space for students' study habits and skills. This paper investigated the feasibility of using chatbots for promoting behavioral change of college students majoring in Computer Science (CS). We conducted semi-structured interviews with CS peer-tutors and surveyed university freshmen to understand issues on students' study habits and identify opportunities for technical intervention. Inspired by the findings, we designed StudyBuddy, a chatbot prototype deployed in Slack, that periodically sends tips, provides assessment of students' study habits via surveys, helps the students break down assignments, recommends academic resources, and sends reminders. We evaluated the usability of the prototype in-depth with 8 students (both first-year and senior students) and 5 course instructors followed by a large scale evaluative survey (n=117) using video of the prototype. Our research identified important design challenges such as building trust and preserving privacy, limiting interaction costs, and supporting both immediate and long-term sustainable support. Likewise, we propose design recommendations that demonstrate context awareness, personalize the experience based on user preferences, and adapt over time as students mature and grow.",

      "abstract": "AI-based educational technologies may be most welcome in classrooms when they align with teachers’ goals,preferences, and instructional practices. Teachers, however, have scarce time to make such customizationsthemselves. How might the crowd be leveraged to help time-strapped teachers? Crowdsourcing pipelineshave traditionally focused on content generation. It is, however, an open question how a pipeline might bedesigned so the crowd can succeed in a revision/customization task. In this paper, we explore an initial versionof a teacher-guided crowdsourcing pipeline designed to improve the adaptive math hints of an AI-basedtutoring system so they fit teachers’ preferences, while requiring minimal expert guidance. In two experimentsinvolving 144 math teachers and 481 crowdworkers, we found that such an expert-guided revision pipelinecould save experts’ time and produce better crowd-revised hints (in terms of teacher satisfaction) than twogeneration conditions. The revised hints however, did not improve on the existing hints in the AI tutor, whichwere already highly rated, though with room for improvement and customization. Further analysis revealedthat the main challenge for crowdworkers may lie in understanding teachers’ brief written comments andimplementing them in the form of effective edits, without introducing new problems. We also found thatteachers preferred their own revisions over other sources of hints, and exhibited varying preferences over hintsin AI-tutor. Overall, the results confirm that there is a clear need for customizing hints to individual teachers’preferences, but also highlight the need for more elaborate scaffolds so the crowd has specific knowledge ofthe requirements that teachers have for hints. The study represents a first exploration in the literature of howto support crowds with minimal expert guidance in revising and customizing instructional materials.",

Yet career development is largely ignored in crowdwork. Crowdwork platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) do not support crowd workers in reskilling and changing careers. In this paper, we study the career goals of AMT workers and the challenges they face in trying to transition out of crowdwork and into high-skill jobs offline or into specialized freelance work. We performed a qualitative study in which we surveyed 20 AMT workers and interviewed 6 of them about their career goals, how they are currently pursuing them, and the challenges they face. We found that crowdworkers aspire to transition out of AMT but face challenges due to lack of career guidance, and limited time and financial resources. Drawing on literature in career studies and organization science, we discuss how crowdworkers' challenges are further aggravated by the enviornment on AMT, and provide implications for future research and design that may better support crowdworkers make a career change.",

To support clinical treatments of substance use disorders (SUDs), formal non-clinical peer recovery support programs pairing coaches with people new to recovery are gaining in popularity. Using a user-centered design approach, we designed a mobile application to support the peer coach recovery program of a health system. The application addresses the needs associated with the coaches’ workflows, encompasses social supports for recoverees, and provides a space for fostering the coach-recoveree relationship. Finally, we then evaluated a prototype with recoverees and program coaches.

      "abstract": "For individuals impacted by their own or a family member’s cancer, connecting with other people in similar situations can be an invaluable source of informational and emotional support. Online spaces provide opportunities for peer support that may be more accessible, given the medical and logistical restrictions on face-to-face socialisation associated with cancer and treatment. However, little is known about the impacts of online peer support. This systematic review surveys the literature on psychosocial impacts of online peer support for people impacted by cancer, integrating research from psychology, health, communications, informatics and social computing disciplines. The reviewed papers and interventions vary widely in the type of online peer support provided, who this support was intended for, and how outcomes were evaluated. Quantitative evidence suggests that online peer support may improve psychosocial wellbeing, particularly anxiety and stress, although this appears to depend on how individuals engage and interact with others. Qualitative findings suggest clear value in connecting and sharing experiences with those in similar situations, benefits which may not be well captured quantitatively. Overall, it appears that for individuals who share experiences, express emotions and feel understood and accepted by others, these online peer spaces may be a valuable and viable source of support. However, these benefits require strategic community design and management to build an active and sustainable group dynamic which can effectively and safely support people impacted by cancer.",

      "abstract": "Collaborative Sequencing (CoSeq) is the process by which a group collaboratively constructs a sequence. CoSeq is ubiquitous, occurring across diverse situations like trip planning, course scheduling, or book writing. Building a consensus on a sequence is desirable to groups, however, accomplishing this requires groups to dedicate significant effort to comprehensively discuss preferences and resolve conflicts. Furthermore, as numerous decisions must be assessed to construct a sequence, this challenge can be exacerbated in CoSeq. However, little research has aimed to effectively support consensus building in CoSeq. As a first step to systematically understand and support consensus building in CoSeq, we conducted a formative study to gain insights on how visual awareness may facilitate the holistic recognition of preferences and the resolution of conflicts within a group. From the study, we identified design requirements to support consensus building and designed a novel visual awareness technique for CoSeq. We instantiated this design in a collaborative travel itinerary planning system, WEAVE, and conducted a summative study to evaluate its effects. We found that visual awareness could decrease the effort of communicating preferences by 21%, and participants' comments suggest that it also encouraged group members to behave more cooperatively when building a consensus. We discuss future research directions to further explore the needs and challenges in this unique context and progress the development of support for CoSeq tasks.",

Research on distributed software development teams has raised the potential of stigmergic coordination, that is, coordination through a shared work product in place of explicit communication. The MIDST system was developed to support stigmergic coordination by making individual contributions to a shared work product visible, legible and combinable. In this paper, we present initial studies of a total of 40 student teams (24 using MIDST) that shows that teams that used MIDST did get the planned benefits for their work, did seem to coordinate at least in part stigmergically and performed better on an assigned project.",

      "abstract": "Freelancers increasingly earn their livelihood through online marketplaces. To attract new clients, freelancers continuously curate their online portfolios to convey their unique skills and style. However, many lack access to rapid, regular, and inexpensive feedback needed to improve their portfolios. Existing crowd feedback systems, which collect feedback on individual creative projects (i.e., decomposed approach), could fill this need, but it is unclear how they might support feedback on multiple projects (i.e., holistic approach). In a between-subjects study with 30 freelancers, we compared decomposed and holistic feedback collection approaches using CrowdFolio, a crowd feedback system for portfolios. The holistic approach helped freelancers discover new ways to describe their work, while the decomposed approach provided detailed insight about the visual attractiveness of projects. This study contributes evidence that portfolio feedback systems, regardless of collection approach, can positively support professional development by impacting how freelancers portray themselves online and reflect on their identity.",

      "abstract": "Creative live streams, where artists or designers demonstrate their creative process, have emerged as a unique and popular genre of live streams due to the real-time interactivity they afford. However, streamer-viewer interactions on most live streaming platforms only enable users to utilize text and emojis to communicate, which limits what viewers can convey and share in real time. To investigate the design space of potential visual and non-textual modalities within creative live streams, we first analyzed existing Twitch extensions and conducted a formative study with streamers who share creative activities to uncover key challenges that these streamers face. We then designed and implemented a prototype system, StreamSketch, which enables viewers and streamers to interact during live streams using multiple modalities, including freeform sketches and text. The prototype was evaluated by two professional artist streamers and their viewers during six streaming sessions. Overall, streamers and viewers found that StreamSketch provided increased engagement and new affordances compared to the traditional text-only modality, and highlighted how efficiency, moderation, and tool integration were continued challenges.",

In this paper, we describe how care coordination depends on the ability to develop shared understanding of care goals and progress. A distributed group of professionals and non-professional caregivers need to share information to provide consistent and holistic support across settings. We conducted fieldwork comprising of 20 interviews and 51 hours of observation across three different programs focused on children’s behavioral health. From this empirical investigation of practices used by distributed care teams, we generated a conceptual framework of shared understanding in care coordination. We identified barriers to shared understanding, as well as nine practices that contribute to its development via two key mechanisms: (1) building relationships across boundaries, and (2) sharing actionable information. We conclude with design implications for enhancing the collaborative practices of members of a care team to cross boundaries despite the barriers that are common in behavioral health and other contexts requiring complex care coordination.",

      "abstract": "With advances in expressive speech synthesis and conversational understanding, an ever-increasing amount of digital content---including social and personal content---can be consumed through voice. Voice has long been known to convey personal characteristics and emotional states, both of which are prominent aspects of social media. Yet, no study has investigated voice design requirements for social media platforms. We interviewed 15 active social media users about their preferences on using synthesized voices to represent their profiles. Our findings show that participants want to have control over how a voice delivers their content, such as the personality and emotion with which the voice speaks, because these prosodic variations can impact users' online persona and interfere with impression management. We report motivations behind customizing or not customizing voice characteristics in different scenarios, and uncover key challenges around usability and the potential for stereotyping. We argue that synthesized speech for social media should be evaluated not only on listening experience and voice quality but also on its expressivity, degree of customizability, and ability to adapt to contexts (e.g., social media platforms, groups, individual posts). We discuss how our contribution confirms and extends knowledge of voice technology design and online self-presentation, and offer design considerations for voice personalization related to social interactions.",

      "abstract": "Most scholarly discussions around ridesharing applications center on the experiences of the drivers and the riders (passengers), and thus the role of the owners of the cars, if they are different from the drivers, remain understudied. However, in many countries in the Global South, the car owners are often different from the car drivers, and the tensions between them often shape the experience with these ridesharing apps in those countries. In this paper, we address this issue based on our interview-based study in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which incorporates semi-structured interviews of 31 Uber drivers and 10 car owners. From our interviews, we identify the contract models that facilitate the partnership between prospective Uber drivers without a car and car owners seeking to rent their cars for Uber, describe the tensions between these two parties, provide a nuanced cultural portrayal of their negotiation mechanisms, and highlight the reasons for which the driver or the owner leaves Uber. Our analysis reveals how the local adoption of sharing economy amplifies existing inequalities and disrupts the prevailing social dynamics. We also connect our findings to the broader interests of CSCW around work, privacy, power and discuss their implications for design and policy formulations.",

      "abstract": "While surgical videos are valuable support material for activities around surgery, their summarization demands great amounts of time from surgeons, leading to very few videos being produced. We study the practices around surgical video to motivate and inform the design of dedicated tools. Through interviews and observations in a field study, we find that (1) video summaries provide an important support for surgery, being used for self-improvement, education, discussing cases, scientific publications, patient communication and as legal resources; (2) video summarization follows a process, hindered by the loss of knowledge that originates during recording; and (3) surgeons develop ad-hoc strategies to articulate coordination. These strategies involve using the video for articulation work, making it both the coordination artifact and the field of work. We discuss ways in which tools can facilitate capturing knowledge in live action using this strategy.",

      "abstract": "Technology bears important relationships to our health and wellness and has been utilized over the past two decades as an aid to support both self-management goals as well as collaboration among treatment teams. However, when chronic illnesses such as eating disorders (ED) are managed outside of institutionalized care settings, designing effective technology to support collaboration in treatment necessitates that we understand the relationships between patients, clinicians, and support networks. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured, interviews with 9 ED patients and 10 clinicians to understand the ED journey through the lens of collaborative efforts, technology use, and potential detriments. Based on our analysis of these 19 interviews, we present novel findings on various underlying disconnects within the collaborative ED treatment process – disconnects among clinicians, between treatment foci, among preferences in tracking, within support networks, and in patients’ own identities. Our findings highlight how these various disconnects are concomitant with and gaps can stem from a lack of collaboration between different stakeholders in the ED journey. We also identify methods of facilitating collaboration in these disconnects through technological mediators.",

      "abstract": "Studies have shown that interpersonal relationships such as families and friends are an important source of support and encouragement to those who seek to engage in healthier habits. However, challenges related to geographic distance may hinder those relationships from fully collaborating and engaging in healthy living together. To explore this domain, we developed and deployed a lightweight photo-based application called PhamilySpace to examine family members and friends engagement and awareness on healthy behaviors while living apart during a week-long intervention. Our analysis of the semi-structured interviews, pre/post-intervention instruments, and application logs suggests three main benefits of interventions for health promotion in this context: (1) increased awareness on acts of health; (2) reciprocal sharing of health information supports social accountability over distance; and (3) positive dialogue around health enhances support on healthy living. By providing insights into distributed family/friends interactions and experiences with the application, we identify benefits, challenges, and opportunities for future design interventions that promote healthy behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Self-tracking technologies, ranging from digital thermometers to wearable fitness trackers, allow users to use personal data accumulated from their everyday activities. But, to use these data, people have to make sense of how these numbers and figures are relevant to their lives in some way in order to make decisions and gain new insight. This process is impacted by people's emotional reactions to their data. While seeking support from others can be an effective strategy for overcoming these emotional challenges, self-trackers face unique barriers in sharing their personal data. Our study investigates 1) how users seek out support online for emotional barriers elicited by their self-tracking data and 2) what self-described impact this sharing has on their self-tracking practices. To investigate these topics, we analyzed discussions in two online communities on Reddit.com centered around infertility and trying to conceive that consistently describe self-tracking experiences. We found that community members described three distinct driving emotional tensions with their self-tracking data. In seeking community input, users were focused on support for understanding and acting upon their feelings and emotions. Even when data was uncertain, frustrating, or viewed as inaccurate, comparing and learning with others benefited users through feelings of connection, control, and humor this collective sense-making provided. Additionally, we found that users taking breaks from self-tracking in whole or part appeared to support their emotional well-being and long-term motivation to track. Based on these findings, we conclude that self-tracking data has social and emotional value beyond perceived accuracy and individual treatment goals.",

      "abstract": "This paper draws attention to new complexities of deploying AI systems to sensitive contexts, such as welfare allocation. AI is increasingly used in public administration with the promise of improving decision-making. To succeed, it needs all the criteria used as part of decisions, formal and informal. In this paper, we empirically explore the informal classifications used by caseworkers to make unemployed welfare seekers ‘fit’ into the formal categories in a Danish job centre. Our findings show that the classifications used by caseworkers are documentable, and hence traceable to AI. To the caseworkers, however, classifications are at odds with the stable explanations assumed by any recording system as they involve negotiated and situated judgments of people’s character. Thus, for moral reasons, caseworkers find them ill-suited for formal representation and would never write them down. As a result, AI is denuded of the real-world (and real work) nature of decision-making. This is imperative to CSCW as it is not only about whether AI can ‘do’ decision-making, as previous research suggests. In this paper, we show that problems may also be caused by the unwillingness of people to provide the data these systems need. It is the purpose of this paper to present the empirical results of this research, followed by a discussion of implications for AI-supported practice and future research.",

      "abstract": "Despite the promises of data-driven artificial intelligence (AI), little is known about how we can bridge the gulf between traditional physician-driven diagnosis and a plausible future of medicine automated by AI. Specifically, how can we involve AI usefully in physicians’ diagnosis workflow given that most AI is still nascent and error-prone (e.g., in digital pathology)? To explore this question, we first propose a series of collaborative techniques to engage human pathologists with AI given AI’s capabilities and limitations, based on which we prototype Impetus—a tool where an AI takes various degrees of initiatives to provide various forms of assistance to a pathologist in detecting tumors from histological slides. We summarize observations and lessons learned from a study with eight pathologists and discuss recommendations for future work on human-centered medical AI systems.",

However, little research has focused on applying such an important teamwork process to computer-mediated collaboration within a fast-paced virtual environment. In this paper, we use esports as a research platform to address this limitation due to its fast-paced nature and its heavy reliance on teamwork. We report the experience and perceptions of 20 players with regard to their descriptions of team cognition within esports. We found that esports players relied on their game experience and understanding of role interdependencies in order to develop team cognition with strangers. We also found that experienced teams utilized a mutual understanding of teammate skills and personalities in order to predict responses and limit the verbal communication required to make quick team decisions. We contribute to CSCW by extending the cognitive understanding of computer-mediated collaboration and by advancing research on team cognition and how it can occur within a fast-paced virtual environment.",

There are many factors which may help users judge the accuracy of news articles, ranging from the text itself to meta-data like the headline, an image, or the bias of the originating source. In this research, participants (n = 175) of various political ideological leaning categorized news articles as real or fake based on either article text or meta-data. We used a mixed methods approach to investigate how various article elements (news title, image, source bias, and excerpt) impact users accuracy in identifying real and fake news. We also compared human performance to automated detection based on the same article elements and find that automated techniques were more accurate than our human sample while in both cases the best performance came not from the article text itself but when focusing on some elements of meta-data. Adding the source bias does not help humans, but does help computer automated detectors. Open-ended responses suggested that the image in particular may be a salient element for humans detecting fake news.",

      "abstract": "Social media platforms provide access to informational and emotional resources that can enable low-income populations to further their socioeconomic mobility and cope with unexpected life demands. However, lack of both interpersonal trust and a sense of shared identity often prevent low-income individuals from eliciting resources from the diverse networks embedded in these platforms. Building on past research, we investigated factors that facilitated and deterred low-income members of the community-based non-profit organization Family Support Network (FSN) from seeking informational and emotional support from other members on the organization’s social media platform, UpLifted. We found that despite participants' perceived shared identity, members primarily requested resources from other UpLifted members through offline interactions due to lack of interpersonal trust. We extend existing research on the limitations of shared identity and the role of interpersonal trust and social norms in facilitating resource-seeking interactions among strangers in low-income contexts. We suggest that social media platforms incorporate pseudonymous posting to facilitate relationship development and allow users to disclose their needs without revealing identifying information.",

      "abstract": "Algorithmic timeline curation is now an integral part of Twitter's platform, affecting information exposure for more than 150 million daily active users. Despite its large-scale and high-stakes impact, especially during a public health emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the exact effects of Twitter's curation algorithm generally remain unknown. In this work, we present a sock-puppet audit that aims to characterize the effects of algorithmic curation on source diversity and content diversity in Twitter timelines. We created eight sock puppet accounts to emulate representative real-world users, selected through a large-scale network analysis. Then, for one month during early 2020, we collected the puppets' timelines twice per day. Broadly, our results show that algorithmic curation increases source diversity in terms of both Twitter accounts and external domains, even though it drastically decreases the number of external links in the timeline. In terms of content diversity, algorithmic curation had a mixed effect, slightly amplifying a cluster of politically-focused tweets while squelching a cluster of tweets focused on COVID-19 fatalities. Finally, we present some evidence that the timeline algorithm may exacerbate partisan differences in exposure to different sources and content. The paper concludes by discussing broader implications in the context of algorithmic gatekeeping.",

      "abstract": "The world is entering a new normal of hybrid organizations, in which it will be very common that some members are co-located and others are remote. Hybridity is rife with asymmetries that effect our sense of belonging in an organizational space. This paper reports a study of an XR telepresence technology probe to explore how remote workers might present and be perceived as an equal and unique embodied being in a workplace. VROOM (Virtual Robotic Overlay for Online Meetings) augments a standard Mobile Robotic Telepresence experience by (1) adding a virtual avatar overlay of the remote person to the local space, viewable through a HoloLens worn by the local user, through which the remote user can gesture and express themselves, and (2) giving the remote user an immersive 360° view of the local space, captured by a 360° camera on the robot, which they can view through a VR headset. We ran a controlled experiment to understand how pairs of participants (one local and one remote) collaborate using VROOM in a search game and word-guessing game. Our findings illustrate that there is much potential for a system like VROOM to support dynamic collaborative activities in which embodiment, gesturing, mobility, spatial awareness, and non-verbal expressions are important. However, there are also challenges to be addressed, specifically around proprioception, the mixing of a physical robot body with a virtual human avatar, uncertainties of others' views and capabilities, fidelity of expressions, and the appearance of the avatar. We conclude with further design suggestions and recommendations for future work.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates how making activities and participation in makerspaces supports the wellbeing and empowerment of women, particularly in making domains that are typically male-dominated. We spent six months undertaking participant observations in a women-only makerspace that runs workshops aimed at teaching women skills in using power tools and woodwork. We conducted contextual interviews with 12 workshop attendees as well as with the makerspace founder and lead instructor. Through the lens of feminist HCI and legitimate peripheral participation, we present trajectories of participation within a women-only makerspace – from beginning as a peripheral participant to becoming a competent and confident maker. We found that through structured workshops in a women-only space that actively teach making skills, the women-only makerspace works to transform the current makerspace landscape so more women can engage with these spaces and participate within them. We contribute three core qualities to foster participation: women-only but without a ‘feminist’ label, configuring a formal and collaborative learning environment, and reification through artefacts. Collectively these work towards new configurations of makerspaces for women that enable their participation within them, and we detail how such configurations work to create trajectories for women’s participation.",

      "abstract": "Emotional validation describes when one believes that their activities, emotions, beliefs, or other reactions are relevant and meaningful given the circumstance. When people experience distressing, stigmatizing life events, their state of emotional validation and thus their perceived sense of normalcy is often disrupted. Online spaces offer opportunities for coping, managing, and making sense of distress and stigma. In this paper, we focus on pregnancy loss as the context of inquiry and as an important example of a disruptive experience that is also associated with stigma. We examine how online spaces help facilitate or disrupt the process of achieving emotional validation among pregnancy loss survivors. We conducted in-depth interviews with women in the United States who had recently experienced a pregnancy loss. We found that individuals seeking a sense of perceived normalcy after pregnancy loss engage in two forms of validation processes that result in emotional validation – informational and experiential. We identified encounters that disrupt the process of seeking, achieving, and maintaining emotional validation related to: information, designs, algorithms, and interpersonal interactions. We introduce the concept of algorithmic symbolic annihilation to describe the representational and emotional harm participants experienced when they felt they were targets of algorithms assuming that all desired pregnancies proceed as expected. Algorithmic symbolic annihilation refers to how algorithms perpetuate normative and stereotypical narratives about phenomena, where what they account for has power and authority, and what they do not account for does not. To aid in seeking, achieving and sustaining emotional validation among pregnancy loss survivors, we suggest designing for 1) representational belonging to combat symbolic annihilation and 2) information avoidance.",

      "abstract": "Smart speakers are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in society and are now used for satisfying a variety of information needs, from asking about the weather or traffic to accessing the latest breaking news information. Their growing use for news and information consumption presents new questions related to the quality, source diversity, and comprehensiveness of the news-related information they convey. These questions have significant implications for voice assistant technologies acting as algorithmic information intermediaries, but systematic information quality audits have not yet been undertaken. To address this gap, we develop a methodological approach for evaluating information quality in voice assistants for news-related queries. We demonstrate the approach on the Amazon Alexa voice assistant, first characterising Alexa's performance in terms of response relevance, accuracy, and timeliness, and then further elaborating analyses of information quality based on query phrasing, news category, and information provenance. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future smart speaker devices and for the consumption of news information via such algorithmic intermediaries more broadly.",

      "abstract": "There is a rumbling debate over the impact of gentrification: presumed gentrifiers have been the target of protests and attacks in some cities, while they have been welcome as generators of new jobs and taxes in others. Census data fails to measure neighborhood change in real-time since it is usually updated every ten years. This work shows that Airbnb data can be used to quantify and track neighborhood changes. Specifically, we consider both structured data (e.g., number of listings, number of reviews, listing information) and unstructured data (e.g., user-generated reviews processed with natural language processing and machine learning algorithms) for three major cities, New York City (US), Los Angeles (US), and Greater London (UK). We find that Airbnb data (especially its unstructured part) appears to nowcast neighborhood gentrification, measured as changes in housing affordability and demographics. Overall, our results suggest that user-generated data from online platforms can be used to create socioeconomic indices to complement traditional measures that are less granular, not in real-time, and more costly to obtain.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we contribute a literature review and organization framework for classifying the collaboration needs and features should be considered when designing headset-based augmented reality (AR) experiences for collocated settings. In recent years augmented reality technology has been experiencing significant growth through the emergence of headsets that allow gestural interaction, and AR designers are increasingly interested in using this technology to enhance collaborative activities in a variety of physical environments. However, collaborative AR applications need to contain features that enhance collaboration and satisfy needs that are present during the group activities. When AR designers lack an understanding of what collaborators need during an interaction, or what features have already been designed to solve those needs, then AR creators will spend time redesigning features that have already been created, or worse, create applications that do not contain necessary features. While much work has been done on designing virtual reality (VR) collaborative environments, AR environments are a relatively newer design space, and designers are lacking a comprehensive framework for describing needs that arise during collaborative activities and the features that could be designed into AR applications to satisfy those needs. In this paper we contribute a literature review of 92 papers in the areas of augmented reality and virtual reality, and we contribute a list of design features and needs that are helpful to consider when designing for headset-based collaborative AR experiences.",

We developed Jarvis, a hybrid object of a glass jar and a location-tracking system that allowed us to examine how Jarvis stimulated making lifestyle values visible and sometimes hiding of the values across different places. As a design research artifact, Jarvis seeks to spark meaningful interactions as zero-waste practitioners carry it around in their daily routines in public. The data visualized through Jarvis demonstrate how users’ values are spread out locally. 18 zero-waste followers participated in a week-long deployment with a design probe followed by post-deployment interviews. Our findings highlight the role of different agencies in circulating values represented by Jarvis. We discuss our methodological insights on hybrid objects, and how the circulation of values may inform us about the alternative roles of technologies in speaking for our lifestyle values.",

      "abstract": "People assume different and important roles within social networks. Some roles have received extensive study: that of influencers who are well-connected, and that of brokers who bridge unconnected parts of the network. However, very little work has explored another potentially important role, that of creating opportunities for people to interact and facilitating conversation between them. These individuals bring people together and act as \"social catalysts.\" In this paper, we test for the presence of social catalysts on the online social network Facebook. We first identify posts that have spurred conversations between the poster’s friends and summarize the characteristics of such posts. We then aggregate the number of catalyzed comments at the poster level, as a measure of the individual’s “catalystness.” The top 1% of such individuals account for 31% of catalyzed interactions. Although these individuals’ network characteristics do not differ markedly from others who have a similar number of friends, their catalyst tendency manifests in other ways: they are more likely to create and participate in Facebook groups and events. By collecting survey data, we also validate the behavioral measure of catalystness: a person is more likely to be nominated as a social catalyst by their friends if their posts prompt discussions between other people more frequently. The measure, along with other conversation-related features, is one of the most predictive of a person being nominated as a catalyst. Although influencers and brokers may have gotten more attention for their network positions, our findings provide converging evidence that another important role exists and is recognized in online social networks.",

      "abstract": "Although expressive writing has proved to be beneficial on physical, mental, and social health of individuals, it has been restrained to lab-based experimental studies. In the real world, individuals may naturally engage with expressive writing when dealing with difficult times, especially when facing a tough health journey. Health blogging may serve as an easy-to-access method for self-therapy, if spontaneous expressive writing occurs. However, many posts may not be expressive enough to provide the therapeutic power. In this study, we build a Gaussian naive Bayes model to detect expressive writing in an online health community, CaringBridge. Because we lack full text data as training data, we use a method to learn model parameters from meta-analysis of the literature. The classifier reaches reasonable accuracy on the test set annotated by the authors. We also explore factors that may influence users' spontaneous expressive writing. We find gender, health condition, author type, and privacy settings can affect individuals' spontaneous expressive writing. Finally, we reflect on our methodology and results and provide design implications for online health communities.",

      "abstract": "Despite the increasingly important role played by image memes in online communication, the research community does not have a good understanding of the elements that can have an effect in making a meme go viral on social media. In this paper, we investigate what visual elements influence the chances that an image meme will go viral, across three dimensions: composition, subjects, and target audience. Drawing from research in vision, psychology, marketing, and neuroscience, we develop a codebook to characterize image memes, and use it to annotate a set of 100 image memes collected from 4chan's Politically Incorrect Board (/pol/). We find that image memes that use a close-up scale and contain characters are more likely to go viral, and so are those including positive or negative emotions. Overall, our analysis sheds light on what indicators characterize viral visual content online, and set the basis for developing better techniques to create or moderate content that is more likely to catch the viewer's attention.",

      "abstract": "An important challenge in building explainable artificially intelligent (AI) systems is designing interpretable explanations. AI models often use low-level data features which may be hard for humans to interpret. Recent research suggests that situating machine decisions in abstract, human understandable concepts can help. However, it is challenging to determine the right level of conceptual mapping. In this research, we use granularity (of data features) and context (of data instance) as ways to determine this conceptual mapping. Based on these measures, we explore strategies for designing explanations in classification models. We introduce an end-to-end concept elicitation pipeline that supports gathering high-level concepts for a given data set. Through crowd-sourced experiments, we examine how providing conceptual information shapes the effectiveness of explanations, finding that a balance between coarse and fine-grained explanations help users better estimate model predictions. We organize our findings into systematic themes that can inform design considerations for future systems.",

But what happens when this gesture of friendly experimentation shifts to something less generous—a power move that pushes technologies to scale through imposition? This talk will trace the history and tacit theory of power embedded in the practice of ‘dogfooding’ to argue for the need to develop an explicit analysis of power in computing. Using the case of building software with community healthcare workers, the presentation will map out an alternate route to building sociotechnical systems, outlining what anti-racist, queer feminist critiques can offer computing as a different path forward for the future of socially-accountable tech.",

      "abstract": "Free and/or open-source software (or F/OSS) projects now play a major and dominant role in society, constituting critical digital infrastructure relied upon by companies, academics, non-profits, activists, and more. As F/OSS has become larger and more established, we investigate the labor of maintaining and sustaining those projects at various scales. We report findings from an interview-based study with contributors and maintainers working in a wide range of F/OSS projects. Maintainers of F/OSS projects do not just maintain software code in a more traditional software engineering understanding of the term: fixing bugs, patching security vulnerabilities, and updating dependencies. F/OSS maintainers also perform complex and often-invisible interpersonal and organizational work to keep their projects operating as active communities of users and contributors. We particularly focus on how this labor of maintaining and sustaining changes as projects and their software grow and scale across many dimensions. In understanding F/OSS to be as much about maintaining a communal project as it is maintaining software code, we discuss broadly applicable considerations for peer production communities and other socio-technical systems more broadly.",

      "abstract": "Scholars have previously described how online communities engage in particular discourses and forms of argumentation. In parallel, HCI and STS researchers have described discourses surrounding ethics and values and their role in shaping design processes and outcomes. However, little work has addressed the intersection of ethical concern and the discourses of non-expert users. In this paper, we describe the argumentation strategies used by Redditors on the subreddit 'r/assholedesign' as they discuss ethically problematic design artifacts. We used content and sequence analysis methods to identify the building blocks of ethical argumentation in this online community, including ethical positioning when raising issues of concern, identification of potential remedies to the original design artifact or issues of concern, and means of extending or negating these elements. Through this analysis, we reveal the breadth of ethical argumentation strategies used \"in-the-wild\" by non-experts, resulting in an increased awareness of the capacity of community members to engage in \"everyday ethics\" regardless of specific ethics training. We describe future opportunities to connect these ethical argumentation strategies with design practices, education, and methods.",

      "abstract": "Prior work on AI-enabled assistive technology (AT) for people with visual impairments (VI) has treated navigation largely as an independent activity. Consequently, much effort has focused on providing individual users with wayfinding details about the environment, including information on distances, proximity, obstacles, and landmarks. However, independence is also achieved by people with VI through interacting with others, such as in collaboration with sighted guides. Drawing on the concept of interdependence, this research presents a systematic analysis of sighted guiding partnerships. Using interaction analysis as our primary mode of data analysis, we conducted an empirical, qualitative study with 4 couples, each made up of person with a vision impairment and their sighted guide. Our results show how pairs used interactional resources such as turn-taking and body movements to both co-constitute a common space for navigation, and repair moments of rupture to this space. This work is used to present an exemplary case of interdependence and draws out implications for designing AI-enabled AT that shifts the emphasis away from independent navigation, and towards the carefully coordinated actions between people navigating together.",

These networks give communities the power to self-determine, build, adapt and use technologies in a way that reflects their values and needs. In African countries where community networks exist, they positively impact communities through stimulation of local economies, creation of jobs, fostering entrepreneurship, strengthening social bonds, improving access to quality education and health. The keynote will examine how community networks in Africa are contributing towards ending the social and economic isolation of the unserved and underserved communities through digital inclusion. It will also unpack how community networks are build by communities and for communities thus shaping technology to their needs, values, and interests. Lastly, will reflect on their resilience, operational realities, challenges and what can be done to support the growth of this movement.",

      "abstract": "Building and maintaining common ground is vital for effective collaboration in CSCW. Moreover, subtle changes in a CSCW user interface can significantly impact grounding and collaborative processes. Yet, researchers and technology designers lack tools to understand how specific user interface designs may hinder or facilitate communication grounding. In this work, we leverage the well-established theory of communication grounding to develop a visual framework, called Joint Action Storyboards (JASs), to analyze and articulate how interaction minutiae of a CSCW environment impact the costs of communication grounding. JASs can depict an integrated view of mental actions of collaborators, their physical interactions with each other and the CSCW environment, and the corresponding grounding costs incurred. We present the development of JASs and discuss its various benefits for HCI and CSCW research. Through a series of case studies, we demonstrate how JASs provide an analysis tool for researchers and technology designers and serve as a tool to articulate the impact of interaction minutiae on communication grounding.",

      "abstract": "Game jams are intense and time-sensitive online or face-to-face game creation events where a digital game is developed in a relatively short time frame (typically 48 to 72 hours) exploring given design constraints and end results are shared publicly. They have increasingly become emerging sites where non-professional game developers, amateurs, and hobbyists engage in bottom-up technological innovation by collaboratively designing and developing more creative and novel digital products. Drawing on 28 interviews, in this paper we focus on how game developers collaborate as small teams to innovate game design and development from the bottom up in virtual game jams (i.e., exclusively online) and the unique role of virtual game jams in their technological innovation. We contribute to CSCW by providing new empirical evidence of how team practices for innovation may emerge in a novel technology community that is not widely studied before. We also expand a growing research agenda in CSCW on explicating nuanced social behaviors, processes, and consequences of bottom-up technological innovation.",

In this study, we expanded upon the known collaborative mechanisms on the English Wikipedia and demonstrated that the collaboration model is best captured through the interplay of these mechanisms. We annotated talk page conversations for types of power plays or vies for control over edits they make to articles, to understand how policy and power play mechanisms in editors’ discussions accounts for behavior in English (EN), Farsi (FA), and Chinese (ZH) language editions of Wikipedia. Our findings show that the same power plays used in EN exist in both FA and ZH but the frequency of their usage differs across the editions. This suggests that editors in different language communities value contrasting types of policies to compete for power while discussing editing an article. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how collaboration models developed from a western perspective translate to non-western languages.",

      "abstract": "The rise of geotargeted online advertising has disrupted the business model of local journalism, but it remains ambiguous whether online advertising platforms can effectively reach local audiences. To address this ambiguity, we present a focused study auditing the positional accuracy of geotargeted display advertisements on Google. We measure the frequency and severity of geotargeting errors by targeting display ads to random ZIP codes across the United States, collecting self-reported location information from users who click on the advertisement. We find evidence that geotargeting errors are common, but minor in terms of advertising goals. While 41% of respondents lived outside the target ZIP code, only 11% lived outside the target county, and only 2% lived outside the target state. We also present details regarding a high volume of suspicious clicks in our data, which made the cost per sample extremely expensive. The paper concludes by discussing implications for advertisers and the business of local journalism.",

      "abstract": "Native American communities are disproportionately effected by a number of behavioral health disparities, including higher rates of depression, substance abuse, and suicide. As mobile health (mHealth) interventions are increasingly used as methods for addressing these disparities, they continue to lack relevance to Native American youth. In an effort to explore the design of relevant behavioral mHealth intervention for Native American communities, we have developed ARORA, a prototype behavioral mHealth intervention that has been co-designed with Native American youth, a community advisory board, and a clinical psychologist. In this paper, we qualitatively analyze our co-design and focus group sessions using a grounded theory approach and identify the key themes that Native American community members have identified as being critical components of relevant mHealth designs. Notably, we find that the Native American youth who participated in our focus groups desired a greater level of didactic interaction with cultural and behavioral health elements. We conclude with a discussion of the significant challenges that we faced in our efforts to co-design software with Native American stakeholders and we provide recommendations that might guide other HCI researchers and designers through challenges that arise during the process of cross-cultural design.",

      "abstract": "To increase patient engagement and facilitate patient-provider collaboration, tools that incorporate patients’ goals into medical care plans are needed. However, few studies have explored how hospitalized patients set and share goals to communicate with their caregivers and clinical care teams. Even less is known for how pediatric patients experience sharing their goals during hospitalization. This paper presents a technology probe study to characterize how pediatric patients perceive goal-setting, and how goal-sharing affects their collaboration with their caregivers and clinical care teams. We conducted this study with 13 patient families and 4 clinicians. We found that goals set and shared by pediatric patients foster the patients’ autonomy to participate in care decision-making, reveal the gaps of understanding between patients and caregivers, support the patients emotionally during patient and care team interaction, and convey the patients’ personalities and preferences to the clinical care team. In addition, we recommend design opportunities to support the different ways that patients’ goals can foster high-quality patient care. We also discuss how patients’ goals impact the tension of shared decisional authority between patients and caregivers, and how goals support pediatric patients transition to self-care.",

      "abstract": "Previous works have shown that effective communication between parental caregivers and child patients has many benefits to the children, such as providing emotional support and coping skills for health management. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, we have identified the challenges parental caregivers face when communicating with their child about health-related information in daily illness management. Three salient challenges that the parental caregivers encountered include: (i) acknowledging different perceptions and approaches to being a cancer patient, (ii) choosing an appropriate communication method, and (iii) understanding their child’s uncommunicated emotions. Based on these challenges, we recognize distinctive, yet implicit, needs that children develop during the illness trajectory, affecting the parent-child dyadic relationship. We discuss design opportunities for a collaborative system that enhances the parent-child dyadic communication by supporting the child’s implicit and dynamically changing needs throughout the illness trajectory and beyond.",

As data scientists seek online spaces to network, learn and share resources with one another, each individual has to employ their own ad-hoc strategy to practice their data science skills. Given these disjointed efforts, it is crucial to ask: how can we build an inclusive, welcoming online community of practice that unites data scientists in their collective efforts to become experts? Daily hashtags on Twitter are used on specific days and have shown promise in forming a community of practice (CoP) in social networking sites like Twitter, but how do they benefit the community and its members? To understand how daily hashtags benefit data scientists and form an online CoP, we conducted a qualitative study on #TidyTuesday---a daily hashtag project for data scientists using R---using the framework of CoP as a lens for analysis. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 participants and uncovered motivations behind their participation in #TidyTuesday, how the project benefited them, and how it cultivated an online CoP. Our findings contribute to the CSCW research on community of practices by providing design trade-offs of using daily hashtags on Twitter, and guidelines on growing and sustaining an online community of practice for data scientists.",

      "abstract": "While most online accounts are designed assuming a single user, past work has found that romantic couples often share many accounts. Our study examines couples’ account sharing behaviors as their relationships develop. We conducted 19 semi-structured interviews with people who are currently in romantic relationships to understand couples’ account sharing behaviors over the lifecycle of their relationship. We find that account sharing behaviors progress through a relationship where major changes happen at the start of cohabitation, marriage, and occasional breakup. We also find that sharing behaviors and motivations are influenced by couples’ relationship ecology, which consists of the dynamics between the couples and the social environment they live in. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for further study to support couples’ sharing needs at different relationship stages and identify design opportunities for technology solutions to facilitate couples’ sharing.",

      "abstract": "Online tools enable users to co-create artifacts remotely. Yet, creative collaborations can also occur for the social process of collaborating itself, for which measures of success and engagement expectations can be more ambiguous, and individuals’ dedication and social dynamics more important. Co-curation of music in collaborative playlists (CPs) is one example of creative collaboration that fulfills both roles, and therefore can have more subtleties in their interactions. We conducted two studies using online surveys to understand perceived comfort and hesitation to the social dynamics embedded in CPs. Differences in collaborators’ ownership perceptions toward CPs and their comfort in interacting with these CPs emerged. We also found varying desire for communication, dependent upon the action and perceived ownership (of CP and songs), with more users expecting greater comfort with a communication channel. From these results, we present four design considerations for more positive and engaged experiences for creative online co-curation.",

      "abstract": "Online sources such as social media have become increasingly important for the proliferation of science news, and past research has shown that reading user-generated comments after an article (i.e. in typical online news and blog formats) can impact the way people perceive the article. However, recent studies have shown that people are likely to read the comments before the article itself, due to the affordances of platforms like Reddit which display them up-front. This leads to questions about how comments can affect people's expectations about an article, and how those expectations impact their interest in reading it at all. This paper presents two experimental studies to better understand how the presentation of comments on Reddit affects people's engagement with science news, testing potential mediators such as the expected difficulty and quality of the article. Study 1 provides experimental evidence that difficult comments can reduce people's interest in reading an associated article. Study 2 is a pre-registered follow-up that uncovers a similarity heuristic; the various qualities of a comment (difficulty, information quality, entertainment value) signal that the article will be of similar quality, ultimately affecting participants' interest in reading it. We conclude by discussing design implications for online science news communities.",

      "abstract": "Chatbots are regarded as a promising technology for delivering guidance. Prior studies show that chatbots have the potential of coaching users to learn different skills; however, several limitations of chatbot-based approaches remain. People may become disengaged from using chatbot-guided systems and fail to follow the guidance for complex tasks. In this paper, we design chatbots with (HC) and without (OC) human support to deliver guidance for people to practice journaling skills. We conducted a mixed-method study with 35 participants to investigate their actual interaction, perceived interaction, and the effects of interacting with the two chatbots. The participants were randomly assigned to use one of the chatbots for four weeks. Our results show that the HC participants followed the guidance more faithfully during journaling practices and perceived a significantly higher level of engagement and trust with the chatbot system than the OC participants. However, after finishing the journaling-skill training session, the OC participants were more willing to keep using the learned skills than the HC participants. Our work provides new insights into the design of integrating human support into chatbot-based interventions for delivering guidance.",

      "abstract": "Algorithmically-mediated content is both a product and creator of dominant social narratives, and it has the potential to impact users' beliefs and behaviors. We present two studies on the content and impact of gender and racial representation in image search results for common occupations. In Study 1, we compare 2020 workforce gender and racial composition to that reflected in image search. We find evidence of underrepresentation on both dimensions: women are underrepresented in search at a rate of 42% women for a field with 50% women (comparable to 2015 levels of underrepresentation); people of color are underrepresented with 16% in search compared to an occupation with 22% people of color (proportional to the U.S. workforce). We also compare our gender representation data with that collected in 2015 by Kay et al., finding little improvement in the last half-decade. In Study 2, we study people's impressions of occupations and sense of belonging in a given field when shown search results with different proportions of women and people of color. We find that both types of representation as well as people's own racial and gender identities impact their experience of image search results, and conclude by emphasizing the need for designers and auditors of algorithms to consider the disparate impacts of algorithmic content on users of marginalized identities.",

In this paper, we study \"batch labeling\", an AI-assisted UX paradigm, that aids data labelers by allowing a single labeling action to apply to multiple records. We ran a large scale study on Mechanical Turk with 156 participants to investigate labeler-AI-batching system interaction. We investigate the efficacy of the system when compared to a single-item labeling interface (i.e., labeling one record at-a-time), and evaluate the impact of batch labeling on accuracy, and time. We further investigate the impact of AI algorithm quality  and its effects on the labelers' overreliance, as well as potential mechanisms for mitigating it.  Our work offers implications for the design of batch labeling systems and for work practices focusing on labeler-AI-batching system interaction.",

      "abstract": "A growing body of work has highlighted the important role that Wikipedia’s volunteer-created content plays in helping search engines achieve their core goal of addressing the information needs of millions of people. In this paper, we report the results of an investigation into the incidence of Wikipedia links in search engine results pages (SERPs). Our results extend prior work by considering three U.S. search engines, simulating both mobile and desktop devices, and using a spatial analysis approach designed to study modern SERPs that are no longer just “ten blue links”. We find that Wikipedia links are extremely common in important search contexts, appearing in 67-84% of all SERPs for common and trending queries, but less often for medical queries. Furthermore, we observe that Wikipedia links often appear in “Knowledge Panel” SERP elements and are in positions visible to users without scrolling, although Wikipedia appears less in prominent positions on mobile devices. Our findings reinforce the complementary notions that (1) Wikipedia content and research has major impact outside of the Wikipedia domain and (2) powerful technologies like search engines are highly reliant on free content created by volunteers.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we report results from fieldwork in the context of municipalities and governmental institutions looking to implement algorithmic decision-making in public service provision. We empirically investigate bureaucratic decision-making practices in the context of governmental job placement, a core public service in many countries, from the perspective of caseworkers. Acting as participants in a large cross-disciplinary research project between 2019-2020 (ongoing), we set up a participatory workshop with caseworkers. This was followed up by in situ interviews that allowed the caseworkers to think-aloud while guiding us as we talked through the decision-making process in governmental job placement. The paper’s contribution is a conceptualization of the characteristics of bureaucratic decision-making in the context of human-AI collaboration: 1) processual decisions that move forward the caseworker’s understanding of the individual case; 2) formal decisions whereby caseworkers close a bureaucratic process or individual’s application; 3) balancing decisions in which the caseworker weighs the potential consequences when a decision is uncertain or questionable. The application of human-AI collaboration in job placement, we argue in this paper, must take the kind of bureaucratic decision (processual, formal, or balancing) into consideration, as we consider from a CSCW perspective how to integrate AI into the already-complicated human workflow of bureaucratic decision- making.",

      "abstract": "It is important to learn from the past as we endeavor into this uncharted territory of mobile human-to-human telepresence for interpersonal use.  With the ever-increasing access to live-streaming cameras, we are now at the cusp of being able to create novel, immersive, and interpersonal telepresence activities that have the potential to change how humans interact with one another on a daily basis.  Due to its novelty, there are likely socio-technical gaps between the needs of users and the technical specifications of the prototypes that are currently being designed to support the complex social interactions of human-to-human telepresence.  Therefore, in this paper, we use a socio-technical lens to conduct a systematic literature review of 51 peer-reviewed articles of early work in this space. Overall, we found that while progress has been made to address the social needs of those involved in telepresence scenarios, there are discontinuities within the existing literature that need to be addressed, particularly with the way we attempt to measure and quantify human-centered outcomes with unvalidated instruments. We also found that the social needs of human streamers have been neglected, as in many articles the streamer was merely treated as a surrogate, or reported feeling socially awkward or unsafe, due to the conspicuous nature of the body-worn technology in public environments.  These findings are prevalent, even as researchers consider adding to this body-worn burden in an attempt to improve the viewer’s sense of immersion and presence.  To preserve the beneficial nature of telepresence interaction while ensuring that all users’ needs are met, researchers should endeavor to further understand the dynamics of the relationship between the viewer, the streamer, and third parties in the remote environment.  Our paper creates a future research agenda that emphasizes the importance of ensuring that all parties involved feel comfortable in their role during interpersonal telepresence interactions.",

      "abstract": "Declarative variables of self-description have a long-standing tradition in matchmaking media. With the advent of online dating platforms and their brand positioning, the volume and semantics of variables vary greatly across apps. However, a variable landscape across multiple platforms, providing an in-depth understanding of the dating structure offered to users, has hitherto been absent in the literature. In this study, more than 300 declarative variables from 22 Anglophone and Francophone dating apps are examined. A mixed-method research design is used, combining hierarchical classification with an interview analysis of nine founders and developers in the industry. We present a new typology of variables in nine categories and a classification of dating apps, which highlights a double mimetic-distinctive mechanism in the variable definition and reflects the dating market. From the interviews, we extract three main factors concerning the economic and sociotechnical framework of coding practices, the actors’ personal experience, and the development methodologies including user traces that influence this mechanism. This work, which to our knowledge is the most extensive thus far on dating app declarative variables, provides a new perspective on the analysis of the intersection between developers and users of online dating, and one that is mediated through variables, among other components.",

Simultaneously, the study of online education has blossomed within the human computer interaction community, with new systems, experiments, and observations creating and exploring previously undiscovered online learning environments. In this study we endeavor to characterize this entire landscape of online learning experiences using a survey of 2260 adults who are balanced to match the demographics of the U.S. We examine the online learning resources that they consult, and we analyze the subjects that they pursue using those resources. Furthermore, we compare both formal and informal online learning experiences on a larger scale than ever before to better understand which subjects people are seeking for intensive study. We find that there is a core set of online learning experiences that are central to other experiences and these are shared among the majority of people who learn online. We conclude by showing how looking outside of these core online learning experiences can reveal opportunities for innovation in online education.",

      "abstract": "Social media can be an especially effective source of feedback on open-ended work, such as product design. Unlike large businesses with entire teams dedicated to “social”, there is little understanding of how small business owners constrained both in personnel and resources can leverage the benefits of direct, informal communication channels afforded by social media. Through a series of design workshops and interviews with 26 small business owners at a local feminist makerspace, we uncover the unique challenges small business owners experience when seeking feedback on open-ended work via social media. We found participants carefully balanced large-scale access to diverse audiences with attempts to receive reliable feedback, and often targeted audiences narrowly to reinstate participants’ control and trust. While business owners idealized building authentic relationships with their social audience to create collectively, they shared the behind-the-scenes work needed to do so successfully such as navigating blurred personal and business identities, and self-regulation necessary to continuously stay engaged and not internalize discouraging feedback.",

      "abstract": "Chatbots systems, despite their popularity in today’s HCI and CSCW researches, fall short for one of the two reasons: 1) many of the systems use a rule-based dialog flow, thus they can only respond to a limited number of pre-defined user inputs with some scripted responses; or 2) they are designed with a focus on a single user scenario, and therefore little is known about these systems’ influence on other users in a community. In this paper, we present a research project that aims to develop a generalizable chatbot architecture to provide social support for community members in an online health community. The architecture is based on advanced neural network algorithms, thus it can handle new inputs from users and generate a variety of responses to them. The system is also generalizable as it can be easily migrate to other online communities. With a follow-up field experiment with the chatbot deployed back into the community, we illustrate the system’s usefulness in providing emotional supporting to individual members. In addition, our study provides empirical understandings to fill the research gap on how a social-support chatbot can positively impact the community engagement.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent personal assistants (IPA), such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, are becoming ever more present in multi-user households. This leads to questions of privacy and consent, particularly for those who do not directly own the device they interact with. When these devices are placed in shared spaces, every visitor and cohabitant becomes an indirect user, potentially leading to discomfort, misuse of services, or unintentional sharing of personal data. To better understand how owners and visitors perceive IPAs, we interviewed 10 in-house users (account owners and cohabitants) and 9 visitors from a student and young professionals sample who have interacted with such devices on various occasions.  We find that cohabitants in shared households with regular IPA interactions see themselves as owners of the device, although not having the same controls as the account owner. Further, we determine the existence of a smart speaker etiquette which doubles as trust-based boundary management. Both in-house users and visitors demonstrate similar attitudes and concerns around data use, constant monitoring by the device, and the lack of transparency around device operations. We discuss interviewees' system understanding, concerns, and protection strategies and make recommendation to avoid tensions around shared devices.",

      "abstract": "Through a computational reading of the online book reviewing community LibraryThing, we examine the dynamics of a collaborative tagging system and learn how its users refine and redefine literary genres. LibraryThing tags are overlapping and multi-dimensional, created in a shared space by thousands of users, including readers, bookstore owners, and librarians. A common understanding of genre is that it relates to the content of books, but this resource allows us to view genre as an intersection of user communities and reader values and interests. We explore different methods of genre measurement within the open space of user-created tags. We measure overlap between books, tags, and users, and we also measure the homogeneity of communities associated with genre tags and correlate this homogeneity with reviewing behavior. Finally, by analyzing the text of reviews, we identify the linguistic and thematic signatures of genres on LibraryThing, revealing similarities and differences between them. These measurements are intended to elucidate the genre conceptions of the users, not, as in prior work, to normalize the tags or enforce a hierarchy. We find that LibraryThing users make sense of genre through a variety of values and expectations, many of which fall outside common definitions and understandings of genre.",

      "abstract": "Spirituality is an understudied topic in social computing; however, for Online Health Community (OHC) users facing life-threatening illness, it is of fundamental importance. Through in-depth focus groups with OHC stakeholders in a US context, we derive a definition of ``spiritual support'' for use by designers and researchers who study online social support. We show that spiritual support is an integral dimension that underlies all other social support types, and that if we ignore spirituality in design, we fail to mitigate problematic issues that arise in online spaces when users' spiritual values clash. Based on participants' ideations, we provide design implications for OHCs and other social media to better facilitate spiritual support through: (1) representing spiritual beliefs, (2) assistance with supportive communication, (3) support network visualization and mobilization, and (4) advance care planning and digital legacy.",

      "abstract": "Prior work on transgender technology users in CSCW has primarily focused on how they interact with algorithms and communication technology, empirically identifying specific use cases and profiles, and speaking largely to the designers and developers of these platforms. This work has emphasized how trans people are excluded, harmed, and misrepresented in existing platforms, algorithms, and research methods. While these critiques are important, this paper explores what trans-inclusive quantitative methods could be by applying a participant- or user-driven approach. While the problem of trans-inclusive, -affirming, or -empowering research methods is not specifically a CSCW problem---as we directly confront by comparing and contrasting the perspectives of CSCW and conventional demography---we argue that a CSCW lens may be uniquely suited to addressing it. To this end, this paper makes several contributions: conceptually, we identify points of increasing convergence between conventional demographic research methods (and criticisms thereof) and CSCW, focusing on shared limitations surrounding how identity is handled in research; methodologically, we present a sketch of how these limitations might be addressed by using social network analysis to “triangulate” social identities while considering them relative and situated; empirically, we implement these methods in a case study of gender within the broader social context of Reddit and discuss the results.",

      "abstract": "Information systems such as mapping platforms, algorithms, and databases are a central component of how society responds to the threats posed by disasters. However, these systems has come under increasing criticism in recent years for prioritizing technical disciplines over insights from the humanities and social science and failing to adequately incorporate the perspectives of at-risk or affected communities. This paper describes a unique month-long workshop that convened interdisciplinary experts to collaborate on a projects related to flood data. In addition to findings about the practical accomplishment of interdisciplinary collaboration, we offer three interrelated contributions. First, we position interdisciplinarity as a critical practice and offer a detailed example of how we staged this process. We then discuss the benefits to interdisciplinarity of expanding the range of temporal logics normally deployed in design workshops. Finally, we reflect on approaches to evaluating the event’s contributions toward sustained critique and reform of expert practice.",

      "abstract": "An increasing number of safety departments in organizations across the U.S. are offering mobile apps that allow their local community members to report potential risks, such as hazards, suspicious events, ongoing incidents, and crimes. These ``community-sourced risk'' systems are designed for the safety departments to take action to prevent or reduce the severity of situations that may harm the community. However, little is known about the actual use of such community-sourced risk systems from the perspective of both community users and the safety departments. This study examines how community users report incidents through mobile apps for help and how safety departments utilize the systems to serve their community members. More specifically, we conducted a comprehensive system log analysis of community-sourced risk systems that were used by safety departments and students at more than 200 American colleges and universities. Our findings revealed a mismatch between what the safety departments expected to receive and what their community members actually reported, and identified several factors (e.g., anonymity of the tip, organization, tip type) that were associated with the safety departments' effective responsiveness to community members' tips. Our findings provide both new design and practical implications for more effective use of community-sourced risk systems for community safety.",

      "abstract": "Qualitative inductive methods are widely used in CSCW and HCI research for their ability to generatively discover deep and contextualized insights, but these inherently manual and human-resource-intensive processes are often infeasible for analyzing large corpora. Researchers have been increasingly interested in ways to apply qualitative methods to \"big\" data problems, hoping to achieve more generalizable results from larger amounts of data while preserving the depth and richness of qualitative methods. In this paper, we describe a study of qualitative researchers' work practices and their challenges, with an eye towards whether this is an appropriate domain for human-AI collaboration and what successful collaborations might entail. Our findings characterize participants' diverse methodological practices and nuanced collaboration dynamics, and identify areas where they might benefit from from AI-based tools. While participants highlight the messiness and uncertainty of qualitative inductive analysis, they still want full agency over the process and believe that AI should not interfere. Our study provides a deep investigation of task delegability in human-AI collaboration in the context of qualitative research, and offers directions for the design of AI assistance that honor serendipity, human agency, and ambiguity.",

      "abstract": "One key technique people use in conversation and collaboration is conversational repair. Self-repair is the recognition and attempted correction of one's own mistakes. We investigate how the self-repair of errors by intelligent voice assistants affects user interaction. In a controlled human-participant study with N = 101 participants, participants asked Amazon Alexa to perform four tasks, and we manipulated whether Alexa would ``make a mistake'' understanding the participant (for example, playing heavy metal in response to a request for relaxing music) and whether Alexa would perform a correction (for example, stating, ``You don't seem pleased. Did I get that wrong?'') We measured the impact of self-repair on the participant's perception of the interaction in four conditions: correction (mistakes made and repair performed), undercorrection (mistakes made, no repair performed),  overcorrection (no mistakes made, but repair performed), and control (no mistakes made, and no repair performed). Subsequently, we conducted free-response interviews with each participant about their interactions. This study finds that self-repair greatly improves people's assessment of an intelligent voice assistant if a mistake has been made, but can degrade assessment if no correction is needed. However, we find that the positive impact of self-repair in the wake of an error outweighs the negative impact of overcorrection. In addition, participants who recently experienced an error saw increased value in self-repair as a feature, regardless of whether they experienced a repair themselves.",

      "abstract": "As social media has become more present in people’s day-to-day lives, many turn to these platforms in natural disasters to keep abreast of the ever-evolving crisis situation. Facing the increasing amount of crisis-related information available on the social media platforms, users tend to focus on and reach out to authoritative sources—individuals or organizations that provide authoritative and credible crisis-related information due to their official status or position. As they provide high-quality information, response from the authoritative sources can be especially valuable to social media users directly affected in natural disasters. In this study, we aim to extend the reach of credible information during crisis, and direct the attention of authoritative users to the affected users who need their help. Specifically, we investigate what factors differentiate the tweets by regular users that receive responses from authoritative accounts from those that do not. We find that regular users’ popularity and official accounts’ level of busyness do not seem to affect the likelihood of tweets receiving a response.We thus explore the linguistic features of the tweets’ content. Topic modeling and sentiment analysis results suggest that these linguistic aspects of the tweets may affect the response rate from authoritative sources. Our findings suggest crisis-related policy implications, as well as design implications for social media platforms where such exchanges take place, which can potentially increase the reach of credible information in a crisis and help those affected obtain the safety-critical information they need.",

      "abstract": "Our food system as a socio-material, heterogeneous infrastructure often remains invisible for citizens. While moments of crisis expose the vulnerabilities and injustices underlying this system, this paper seeks to explore which processes and tools CSCW could purposely design to `open up' food infrastructures and bring young and adult people in contact with different aspects of the food system to cultivate food citizenship from a more-than-human perspective. Through a collaboration with a local primary school and four different food organisations (a mushroom grower, a vegetable farm, a bread-baking community centre, and a food bank), we designed `contact zones' that would enable a class of 7-8-year-old students to encounter socio-material food practices at each partnering organisation's site and in the classroom. Our insights show young people's rich engagement in the socio-materiality of place, food, and practices; how encountering food practices across very different sites helped surface the interconnectedness of the food system and its meanings; and how the contact zones opened spaces to practice food citizenship. The paper offers design implications towards infrastructuring more-than-human food pedagogies. It discusses inherent power dynamics of more-than-human design collaborations, critically evaluates the role of technology in more-than-human relations, and presents three design opportunities for a relational understanding towards food.",

      "abstract": "The rapid growth of open source software necessitates a deeper understanding of moderation and governance methods used within these projects. The code of conduct, a set of rules articulating standard behavior and responsibilities for participation within a community, is becoming an increasingly common policy document in open source software projects for setting project norms of behavior and discourage negative or harassing comments and conversation. This study describes the conversations around adopting and crafting a code of conduct as well as those surrounding community governance. We conduct a qualitative analysis of a random sample of GitHub issues that involve the code of conduct and identify different categories of surrounding conversation. We find that codes of conduct are used both proactively and reactively to govern community behavior in project issues. Oftentimes, the initial addition of a code of conduct does not involve much community participation and input. However, a controversial moderation act is capable of inciting mass community feedback and backlash. Project maintainers balance the tension between disciplining potentially offensive forms of speech and encouraging broad and inclusive participation. These results have implications for the design of inclusive and effective governance practices for open source software communities.",

      "abstract": "As the variety of possible interactions with virtual reality (VR) continues to expand, researchers need a way to relate these interactions to users’ needs and goals in ways that advance understanding. Several researchers have called for better attention to mixed reality and co-located interactions, but these efforts have largely focused on the symmetric use of technology, which excludes a rising form of interaction known as asymmetric VR, in which participants use different interfaces to interact with a shared environment. Currently, there is not a systematic way to characterize 1) the ways in which a system may be asymmetric, 2) how the different mediation technology and affordances within asymmetric VR support (or do not support) users’ goals, and 3) the relationships and collaborative capabilities between users of these different technologies. In this paper, the authors review the most-relevant existing frameworks for asymmetric interaction, mediation technology, and computer supported cooperative work to categorize types of asymmetric VR along three Axes of Asymmetry and present the Composite framework for Asymmetric VR (CAVR).  The paper concludes with suggestions of ways to test and expand the framework in order to guide future research as it identifies the most-beneficial interaction paradigms for asymmetric VR.",

      "abstract": "In 2015, Facebook launched Legacy Contact to allow account holders to choose someone to manage their postmortem, memorialized profile. This study evaluates the Legacy Contact setup process, and asks how users form and communicate expectations about what an active post-mortem manager’s responsibilities would be. We conducted 30 semi-structured interviews with adult Facebook account holders in the US who either configured their own settings or were chosen for future delegation by someone else. We found that account holders chose the Facebook Friend they felt closest to, and that selection was often reciprocated. Both accountholders and legacy contacts felt confident that they had communicated (or could communicate) well about the legacy contact’s responsibilities, but their expectations did not align with the actual functionality of the Legacy Contact system. We argue that the misalignment of user expectations and system functionality indicates a significant opportunity to improve the setup process. Our findings indicate that post-mortem management systems require a setup process that is fundamentally different from the quick-clickthrough standards of everyday interaction design. The ramifications of a postmortem manager’s expectations not being met during a time of grief, points to the urgent need for a setup process that prompts thoughtfulness and deliberation, and forms accurate expectations for account holders and future postmortem managers alike.",

      "abstract": "Governance in online communities is an increasingly high-stakes challenge, and yet many basic features of offline governance legacies—juries, political parties, term limits, and formal debates, to name a few—are not in the feature-sets of the software most community platforms use. Drawing on the paradigm of Institutional Analysis and Development, this paper proposes a strategy for addressing this lapse by specifying basic features of a generalizable paradigm for online governance called Modular Politics. Whereas classical governance typologies tend to present a choice among wholesale ideologies, such as democracy or oligarchy, Modular Politics would enable platform operators and their users to build bottom-up governance processes from computational components that are modular and composable, highly versatile in their expressiveness, portable from one context to another, and interoperable across platforms. This kind of approach could implement pre-digital governance systems as well as accelerate innovation in uniquely digital techniques. As diverse communities share and connect their components and data, governance could occur through a ubiquitous network layer. To that end, this paper proposes the development of an open standard for networked governance.",

      "abstract": "Voice-Activated Artificial Intelligence (VAI) is increasingly ubiquitous, whether appearing as context-specific conversational assistants or more personalised and generalised personal assistants such as Alexa or Siri. CSCW and other researchers have regularly studied the (positive and negative) social consequences of their design and deployment. One particular focus has been questions of gender, and the implications that the (often-feminine) gendering of VAIs has for societal norms and user experiences. Studies into this have largely elided transgender (trans) existences; the few exceptions to this operate largely from an external and predetermined idea of trans and/or non-binary user needs, centered on representation. In this study, we undertook a series of qualitative interviews with trans and/or non-binary users of VAIs to explore their experiences and needs. Our results show that these needs are far more than a question of representation, and instead have implications for the framing of gender as a concept by VAI designers, their approach to user privacy, the wider feature set supported, and the structures and contexts in which VAIs are designed. We provide both immediate recommendations for designers and researchers seeking to create trans-inclusive VAIs, and wider, critical proposals for how we as researchers go about assessing technological systems and appropriate points of intervention.",

However, recent work suggests users can exert leverage using their role as contributors of valuable data, for instance by withholding their data contributions to intelligent technologies. We propose and evaluate a new means to exert leverage against tech companies: “conscious data contribution” (CDC). Users who participate in CDC exert leverage against an offending tech company by contributing data to technologies operated by a competitor of that offending company. Using simulations, we find that CDC could be highly effective at reducing the gap in performance of intelligent technologies between an incumbent and their competitors. In some cases, just 20% of users contributing their data to a small competitor could help that competitor get 80% of the way towards best-case performance. We discuss the implications of CDC for policymakers, tech designers, and researchers.",

      "abstract": "Social interaction across multiple online platforms is a challenge for gender and sexual minorities (GSM) due to the stigmatization they face, which increases the complexity of their self-presentation decisions. These online interactions and identity disclosures can be more complicated for GSM in non-Western contexts due to consequentially different audiences and perceived affordances by the users, and limited baseline understanding of the conflation of these two with local norms and the opportunities they practically represent. Using focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews, we engaged with 61 Hijra individuals from Bangladesh, a severely stigmatized GSM from south Asia, to understand their overall online participation and disclosure behaviors through the lens of personal social media ecosystems. We find that along with platform audiences, affordances, and norms, participant skill/knowledge, and cultural influences also impact navigation through multiple platforms, resulting in differential benefits from privacy features. This impacts how Hijra perceive online spaces, and shape their self-presentation and disclosure behaviors over time.

      "abstract": "Enabling the free and equal exchange of arguments on social issues in a respectful manner is an integral part of establishing the democratic ideal. However, the current manifestation of online spaces tends to facilitate the gathering of like-minded people, leading to polarization of opinions. Such polarization inhibits the sharing of diverse opinions and deteriorates respect for disagreeing opinions, preventing the ideal exchange of opinion. To tackle this issue, we present StarryThoughts, an online system that supports users for expressing and exploring diverse perspectives on social issues. The system supports three types of exploration of the collected arguments online: navigating opinions based on the demographic identities of the posters, checking the user's demographic stereotypes related to given social issues, and engaging with opinions with semantically different point-of-views. Results from a user study with 50 participants showed that the system enables participants to explore a wide range of opinions on social issues, to be more informed on the various arguments, and to be more confident about their opinion. From our findings, we provide several design considerations for building online systems for supporting users to explore diverse opinions on social issues.",

      "abstract": "Individuals share increasing amounts of personal multimedia data, exposing themselves (uploaders) as well as others (data subjects). Non-consensual sharing of multimedia data that depicts others raises so-called multiparty privacy conflicts (MPCs), which can have severe consequences. To limit the incidence of MPCs, a family of Precautionary mechanisms have recently been developed that force uploaders to collaborate with the other data subjects to prevent MPCs. However, there is still very little work on understanding how users perceive the Precautionary mechanisms together with which ones they prefer and why. In addition, Precautionary mechanisms have some limitations, e.g., they require linking content to the co-owners’ identity. Therefore, we also explore alternatives to Precautionary mechanisms and propose a new class of solutions—Dissuasive mechanisms—that aim at deterring the uploaders from sharing without consent. We then present a user-centric comparison of Precautionary and Dissuasive mechanisms, through a large-scale survey (𝑁 = 1792). Our results showed that respondents prefer Precautionary to Dissuasive mechanisms. These enforce collaboration, provide more control to the data subjects, but also they reduce uploaders’ uncertainty around what is considered appropriate for sharing. We learned that threatening legal consequences is the most desirable Dissuasive mechanism, and that respondents prefer the mechanisms that threaten users with immediate consequences (compared with delayed consequences). Dissuasive mechanisms are in fact well received by frequent sharers and older users, while Precautionary mechanisms are preferred by women and younger users. We discuss the implications for design, including considerations about side leakages, consent collection, and censorship.",

      "abstract": "Online chat functions as a discussion channel for diverse social issues. However, deliberative discussion and consensus-reaching can be difficult in online chats in part because of the lack of structure. To explore the feasibility of a conversational agent that enables deliberative discussion, we designed and developed DebateBot, a chatbot that structures discussion and encourages reticent participants to contribute. We conducted a 2 (discussion structure: unstructured vs. structured) × 2 (discussant facilitation: unfacilitated vs. facilitated) between-subjects experiment (N = 64, 12 groups). Our findings are as follows: (1) Structured discussion positively affects discussion quality by generating diverse opinions within a group and resulting in a high level of perceived deliberative quality. (2) Facilitation drives a high level of opinion alignment between group consensus and independent individual opinions, resulting in authentic consensus reaching. Facilitation also drives more even contribution and a higher level of task cohesion and communication fairness. Our results suggest that a chatbot agent could partially substitute for a human moderator in deliberative discussions.",

      "abstract": "Physical face-to-face collaboration with someone gives a higher-quality experience compared to mediated communication options, such as a phone- or video-based chat. Participants can share rich sensory cues to multiple human senses in a physical space. Also, the perceptual sensing of the surrounding environment including other peoples' reactions can influence human communication and emotion, and thus collaborative performance. Shared spaces in virtual environments provide degraded sensory experiences because most commercial virtual reality systems typically provide only visual and audio feedback. The impact of richer, multi-sensory feedback on joint decision-making tasks in VR is still an open area of research. Two independent studies exploring this topic are presented in this paper. We implemented a multi-sensory system that delivers vision, audio, tactile, and smell feedback, and we compared the system to a typical VR system. The scenario placed two users in a virtual theme-park safari ride with a number of non-player character (NPC) passengers to simulate realistic scenarios compared to the real-world and we varied the type and complexity of NPCs reactions to participants. In Experiment 1, we provided both users with either multi-sensory or typical sensory feedback symmetrically as a between-subjects factor, and used NPC reaction type as a within-subjects factor. In Experiment 2, we provided sensory feedback asymmetrically to each user (i.e., one had multi-sensory cues and the other had typical sensory cues) as a between-subjects factor, and used NPC reaction type as a within-subjects factor. We found that the number of sensory channels and NPC reactions did not influence user perception significantly under either symmetric or asymmetric sensory feedback conditions. However, after accounting for individual personality traits (e.g., assertive, passive), as well as any existing relationship between the pairs, we found that increasing the number of sensory channels can significantly improve subjective responses.",

      "abstract": "People living with Parkinson’s disease engage in self-tracking as part of their health self-management. Whilst health technologies designed for this group have primarily focused on improving the clinical assessments of the disease, less attention has been given to how people with Parkinson’s (PwP) use technology to track and manage their disease in their everyday life. We report on a qualitative study in which we systematically analysed posts from an online health community (OHC) comprising people with Parkinson’s. Our findings show that PwP track a diversity of information and use a wide range of digital and non-digital tools, informed by temporal and structured practices. Using an existing framework of sensemaking for chronic disease self-management, we also identify new ways in which people with Parkinson’s engage in sensemaking, alongside a set of new challenges that are particular to the character of this chronic disease. We relate our findings to technologies for self-tracking offering design implications.",

At the intersection of these interdisciplinary perspectives comes a tension playing out in formal and informal venues: is CSCW’s role to fix and improve existing technologies, or is it to start over and build anew? In this panel, we address this question with an eye towards enabling practicable critique within CSCW, and help navigate this tension that arises in our interdisciplinary community. Our panelists reflect methodological diversity in CSCW and positional differences on these questions. We look forward to a lively, spirited discussion between panelists that build on three provocations and engage the community on this important and critical issue.",

We analyze two historical cases of technology-infused development projects in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador and in Jamaica. We find that speculation in these contexts remixes the constructive stance toward speculation typical for normative technoscience with the critical, contesting orientation of speculative design. Conflicts between these stances are resolved by leveraging fantasy for pragmatic ends, grounding audacious fictions in imported realities, unmooring from conventional understandings of linear technological progress, and using even conservative futures to trouble colonial conventions.",

      "abstract": "Shared gaze visualizations, where the real-time gaze location of group members is shared with one another, have become increasingly studied over the last decade by HCI researchers due to their potential in facilitating communication and increasing group performance. Studies involving peer collaborators find improved outcomes and better collaboration. Less is known, however, on how gaze sharing may aid learners and instructors. In our study, an instructor teaches a learner how to assemble and program a simple microcontroller, communicating either through a webcam feed (webcam condition), a field-of-view video feed (HMC condition), or a field-of-view video feed with a gaze location pointer (gaze condition). We find that with the gaze condition, learning gain is highest, especially for low achievers. Moreover, we see that instructors predict learner post-scores more accurately, suggesting gaze sharing helps instructors track the cognitive state of the learner. This effect was also most salient for low achievers. We find that the HMC condition that only lacked this single dot, many of the benefits for both learning and teaching were lost. The paper concludes with discussions on how gaze visualization may have supported learning and teaching, as well as the tool’s limitations and conditions for usefulness.",

      "abstract": "Licencing frameworks are embedded with sociotechnical imaginaries that limit the potential for networked technologies to make traditional media forms, like radio, more inclusive. We implemented a prototype platform that aims to enable more people to run small radio stations by using internet and mobile networks to avoid the costs of studios and specialist equipment. We sought to refine the prototype by responding to the needs of users as they set up four community radio stations in rural Romania and on Irish islands over two years. Despite national differences, their respective regulations limited who articulated requirements. Activities in applying for and complying with licences shaped design priorities by imposing temporal demands and assumptions about studios, professionalism, and certain organisational structures and division of responsibilities. Indeed, although small rural community stations present no threat of radio interference or competition to media corporations that pursue market power, they are subject to values associated with them. Regulatory frameworks are specific to nations and media form; however, our analysis illustrates that broader sociotechnical imaginaries impede designing technology to widen inclusion, which we hope will provoke discussion in HCI and CSCW about our responsibilities in engaging with the policies that shape possible futures.",

      "abstract": "Health disclosure at work is complicated for people with invisible chronic conditions. Due to the lack of visible symptoms, invisible conditions affect the work life of people in ways that are not obvious to others. This study examines how people disclose and conceal their conditions in the workplace and opens the designs space for this topic. In the first phase, we analyzed posts on two subreddit forums, r/migraine and r/fibromyalgia, and found a range of strategies that individuals use to disclose or conceal their conditions. In the second phase, we created five technological design concepts based on these strategies that were shown to eight people with migraines or fibromyalgia in semi-structured interviews. Based on these phases, we contribute understandings of disclosure of invisible conditions in the workplace for future research, such as potential areas for intervention ranging from individual to societal level efforts, as well as the potential and limitations of relying on empathy from others.",

      "abstract": "As online platforms become ubiquitous, there is growing concern that their use can potentially lead to negative outcomes in users’ lives. A central question in the literature studying this phenomenon is whether quantity of use is related to problematic offline effects like reduced sleep. This is often addressed by either analyzing self-reported measures of time spent online, which are generally inaccurate, or using objective metrics derived from server logs or tracking software. However, how these two types of time measures comparatively relate to problematic effects — whether they complement or are redundant with each other in predicting problematicity — remains unknown. Furthermore, transparent research in the literature is hindered by its focus on closed platforms with inaccessible data, as well as selective analytical decisions that may lead to reproducibility issues. In this work, we investigate the relationships between both self-reported and data-derived metrics of time spent and potentially problematic effects arising from use of an open, non-profit online chess platform. These effects include disruptions to sleep, relationships, school and work performance, and self-control. To this end, we distributed a gamified survey to players and linked their responses with publicly-available game logs. We find problematic effects to be associated with both self-reported and data-derived usage measures to similar degrees. However, analytical models incorporating both self-reported and actual time explain problematic effects significantly more effectively than models with either type of measure alone. Furthermore, these results persist across thousands of possible analytical decisions when using a robust and transparent statistical framework. This suggests that the two methods of measuring time spent measure contain distinct, complementary information about problematic usage outcomes and should be used in conjunction with each other.",

      "abstract": "Practice is essential for learning. However, for many interpersonal skills, there often are not enough opportunities and venues for novices to repeatedly practice. Role-playing simulations offer a promising framework to advance practice-based professional training for complex communication skills, in fields such as teaching. In this work, we introduce ELK (Eliciting Learner Knowledge), a role-playing simulation system that helps K-12 teachers develop effective questioning strategies to elicit learners' prior knowledge. We evaluate ELK with 75 pre-service teachers through a mixed-method study. We find that teachers demonstrate a modest increase in effective questioning strategies and develop sympathy towards students after using ELK for 3 rounds. We implement a supplementary activity in ELK in which users evaluate transcripts generated from past role-play sessions. We demonstrate that evaluating conversation moves is as effective for learning as role-playing, while without requiring the presence of a partner. We contribute design implications for role-play systems for communication strategy training.",

      "abstract": "The internet facilitates opportunities for adolescents to form relationships and explore their sexuality but seeking intimacy online has also become a stressor. As a result, adolescents often turn to the internet to seek support concerning issues related to sex because of its accessibility, interactivity, and anonymity. We analyzed 3,050 peer comments and 1,451 replies from adolescents (837 posts) who sought advice and/or support about online sexual experiences involving known others. We found peers mostly provided information and emotional support. They gave advice on how to handle negative online sexual experiences and mitigate their long-term repercussions, often based on their own negative experiences. They provided emotional support by letting teens know that they were not alone and should not blame themselves. A key implication of these findings is that these situations seemingly occurred regularly and youth were converging on a subset of norms about how to handle such situations in a way that supported one another. Yet, in some cases, they also resorted to victim-blaming or retaliating against those who broke these norms of \"safe\" sexting. Teens were grateful for emotional support and advice that helped them engage safely but were defensive when peers were critical of their relationships. Together, our findings suggest that youth are self-organizing to converge on guidelines and norms around safe sexting but have trouble framing their messages so that they are more readily accepted. In our paper, we contribute to the adolescent online safety literature by identifying youth-focused beliefs about safe sexting by analyzing the ways in which online peers give advice and support. We provide actionable recommendations for facilitating the exchange of positive advice and support via online peer-support platforms",
