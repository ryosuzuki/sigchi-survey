      "abstract": "It is now an unfortunate, yet well-known, fact that approximately 1 in 5 women (~18%) report lifetime exposure to sexual assault [7]. These statistics, among others, highlight the ever-present need for comprehensive sex education, particularly with regards to consent and relationship norms. Unfortunately, without cohesive or consistent implementation processes for sex education, a highly diverse “patchwork” of sex education laws and practices exist in the United States [3]. In response to these issues, our team decided to make a scenario-based video game to teach incoming college freshmen about common situations that may happen at a college party, and the best ways to handle those situations. ‘Survive the Party’ is a scenario-based experiential learning game where learners play as a ghost that is haunting a college party. The ghost floats around the party and ‘overhears’ various conversations between individuals of different backgrounds, genders, and sexual identities. At certain points in each scenario, the ghost can step in and make decisions about how the scenario should play out. In this paper, we will describe our background research, our targeted learning goals, the game itself, possible applications for our game in educational settings, and finally, opportunities for future work.",

      "abstract": "When learning how to develop AI behavior it is common for students to test different ideas before settling on a desired outcome. This functionality is not available in modern behavior tree systems beyond the traditional methods of duplication and conditional execution. We present NCAlt – a visual behavior authoring framework for exploring multiple game AI behaviors. The system also allows selective merging of nodes between multiple behavior tree alternatives and their visual differencing in the game scene and behavior tree views. We present two worked examples which demonstrate how NCAlt can improve the workflow of game development students. We have conducted a user study where NCAlt was compared against NodeCanvas for creating and using alternatives with moderately skilled game development students. Participants rated NCAlt 15% higher than NodeCanvas on the System Usability Scale (SUS). NCAlt was also rated higher on a self-developed questionnaire. We also conducted a semi-structured interview and a detailed longitudinal follow-up and obtained mostly positive feedback for NCAlt. The results suggest NCAlt has a potential to improve the types of workflows with behavior trees that involve exploration for game development students and facilitate learning, as a result. NCAlt was built on top of NodeCanvas – a plugin for the Unity Engine.",

      "abstract": "Players’ affective states during gameplay are hard to assess and distinguish due to the highly dynamic and uncertain nature of video games. While understanding the player's emotional experience is important for game design and gamified applications, the relationship between player emotion and game experience remains unknown. This project focuses on the identification of players’ dynamic affective states using sensing technology and the assessment of the interconnectedness between player characteristics, emotional experience, and game experience. In particular, this study investigates the effectiveness of using eye-tracking and other physiological signals to recognize players’ emotions triggered by different game events and the impact of individual differences on their emotional experiences. Combining objective physiological sensing technology with the investigation of individual characteristics, the outcomes of this research are expected to help better understand the complex player emotions in games and their link with player experience.",

Increasing awareness can help prevent this outcome. In this paper, we present Focus, a serious game, aimed at teenagers. Focus helps the player identify cognitive distortions.  The environment illustrates the various effects of the distortion to provide a visual interpretation to the player. Exploring the world of his inner thoughts, the player is investigating and documenting strange artifacts present in his world and the reasons behind them. The investigation is providing a playground to discover the effects of cognitive distortion on the player's world perception. Focus is built around one cognitive distortion: \"All or Nothing\", but the concept can be applied to other distortions.",

      "abstract": "Adherence and frequency of play are well-established challenges for serious games that target breathing exercises, because exercises are most effective when practiced in short and frequent sessions. Researchers have recognized that elements of idle games ideally align with many therapeutic use cases because idle games have a frequently repeating gameplay cycle that draws people in for short play sessions. However, there is little research about how idle games can be used to motivate consistent, frequent practice of therapies like breathing exercises that are often recommended for chronic conditions like ADHD. This paper describes the design and implementation of a therapeutic idle game, Focus Cat. This game is designed to help people with ADHD incorporate breathing exercises into their symptom management routine. Our work demonstrates how the unique qualities of idle game design—including short, frequent gameplay sessions, simple mechanics that make mundane tasks engaging and mechanics that pull and push players into and out of active gameplay—can be used for ADHD breathing exercises to improve adherence and frequency of practice.",

      "abstract": "The goal of this research is to study the organizational dynamics that are enacted by amateur players, streamers, and professionals in a multiplayer First-Person Shooter video game, namely Call of Duty: Warzone. These categories of players represent different “work-play” conditions, as they have different motives for playing. I assume that these players may enact different organizational behaviors to reach their objectives. To explore this hypothesis, I have been conducting a digital ethnography within an Italian gaming community since 2021, employing observations, semi-structured interviews and analysis of the communication exchanges occurring during the gaming sessions. In the literature, a cross-comparison between these players is currently missing. This work may then clarify how different “combinations of work and play” may affect players’ behaviors and organizational dynamics, as well as how they may be differently impacted by the design of the game.

      "abstract": "Latency, the temporal delay between in- and output, is inherently part of the communication between humans and computers. In video games, high latency reduces player performance and experience. These adverse effects are particularly pronounced in fast-paced video games, such as first-person shooters. Previous work shines light on how latency affects video games and how to counteract latency in video games. However, there are still unknown aspects to latency and its compensation. Thus, in the first step, we investigate novel approaches to understand latency in video games, for example, the effects of long-term switching latency. In the second step, we propose new approaches to compensate for latency in video games. We present a novel avenue to latency compensation utilizing deep learning models predicting either internal game states or external user actions. ",

      "abstract": "Environmental sustainability has become more and more a very important topic that will also change our way of life in the near future. A question is how people can be influenced into becoming more aware of environmental sustainability. Since technology is considered a means to simplify people's lives, it can also be used as a tool to support people's awareness of these aspects. This paper investigates how we can use a mobile phone in combination with a solar panel as a wearable in a playful way to support people's awareness of plant-based environments. For this purpose, the first version of a mobile game was developed with the goal that the players can not only learn what a plant needs to grow healthy but also learn about the sun as a renewable energy source.",

In academia, the research of the metaverse is in its infancy, with prior works focused on technological and\r\ncomputational aspects of the concept. Still, a firm understanding of the lived user experiences of hybrid spaces is a significant gap in the literature. Further, Location-based games (LBG) have been started to be viewed as proto-metaverse applications with the potential to transition into real-world metaverse applications; however, little work explores how developers and researchers may facilitate this change. This report presents my research proposal to address the two lacunae mentioned above. First, I discuss state-of-the-art and present my research agenda.

Exergames can make this routine more engaging, which can increase the compliance of the patient. This research explores the feasibility of an exergame device called the Squid Monster. The device is the result of a research through design process, and it is designed to be played on smartphones in the home environment. It operates on the smartphone’s integrated sensors and two external squeeze sensors, making it accessible and cost-effective. We conceptualize how the design can be supported using a machine learning adaptive difficulty system, aiming to increase flow and therapeutic adherence of the device.

      "abstract": "Game cheating is the act of gaining an unfair advantage over one's opponents. It is prevalent across many competitive games to the detriment of many players and developers, and has remained a significant problem despite industry efforts to eradicate it. Previous work has broadened our understanding of why players cheat but the social practices surrounding cheating have yet to be documented. This knowledge gap hinders researchers from comprehending the full extent of cheating necessary to scope relevant research in a meaningful way. The following dissertation serves to address this gap through exploratory studies that adopt a community perspective on cheating. The work so far involved mapping the governance mechanisms and examining the artefacts facilitating cheating. Building on these findings, I plan to explore the resource development process, and ultimately provide a framework tying the results together into an integrated structure. By documenting the social forces that shape and support cheating, scholars will be better informed when surveying the phenomenon in the future.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Since game bots and Gold Farmer Group (GFG) create critical damage toward the ecosystem of MMORPGs, game companies have struggled to detect bot characters with various methods. Primarily, previous researches identified GFGs by analyzing particular behavior patterns of bots, but these methods have become easier to be neutralized as bots started to mimic normal characters. Moreover, the spread of mobile MMORPGs increased the diversity of character behavior; thus, analysis of behavior patterns becomes a more challenging task. To address this problem, we propose a bot detection method which is generally applicable toward modern MMORPGs in both PC and mobile environment. We focused on the analogy that bot characters and normal characters show different patterns of financial activities. As game bots are born to collect game assets for Real Money Trade (RMT), they show patterned changes in financial status to maximize its efficiency. On the other hand, normal characters take various types of financial activity as users play various in-game contents, not only accumulate the asset. Throughout the study, our series of analysis propose contributions as follow. First, we clarified financial sequences of game bots are different from normal characters; therefore, the sequential form of financial features precisely describes the financial pattern of characters. Second, we established a bot detection model with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) trained with the aforementioned financial sequences. With the real-world log data extracted from three PC games (Lineage, Aion, Blade and Soul), and one mobile game (Lineage M), we validated the proposed detection model effectively identifies game bots from normal users. Lastly, our detection model is widely applicable in both PC MMORPG and mobile MMORPG.",

      "abstract": "This work aims to develop a cooperative gamified testbed for teamwork assessment using an event-based approach. Cooperative game features have been used in previous work to understand social play and develop serious games where cooperation, interdependence and asymmetry are applied. Players in cooperative games engage in teamwork processes such as communication, coordination, planning and performance monitoring. The event-based approach to training is a methodology used to develop teamwork simulations using scripted trigger events that have an explicit connection with the targeted teamwork competencies. A process was developed to identify cooperative features that serve as behavioral triggers and to establish a connection between teamwork competencies, gamified features, and targeted behavioral responses. Furthermore, the paper presents a game prototype design developed using the event-based approach and the identified cooperative game features. This paper aims to present this process as a framework for serious cooperative games’ development and to establish cooperative games as testbeds for objective teamwork assessment.    ",

      "abstract": "Digital games have been demonstrated to promote recovery from daily work strain. However, prior research has not examined the role that player experience (PX) plays in post-work recovery despite the fact that theories in this area rely implicitly on PX concepts. Hence, this research seeks to understand how the experience of immersion shapes the recovery potential of digital games. An overview of the planned program of research, alongside the results of an initial mixed-methods survey study, are outlined here. The results suggest that immersion is broadly beneficial for recovery, though this is contingent on contextual factors, and that players actively optimise their immersion levels to maximise recovery. These findings, and those of future studies, will extend previous research by empirically testing the PX-based mechanisms by which games are assumed to promote recovery, as well as offering design implications for creators of serious games for recovery purposes.",

      "abstract": "Gamification is widely known and implemented for various purposes. But it is also criticized for recurring lack of quality. Many researchers developed gamification frameworks and tools to ensure a purposeful gamification, but these theoretical frameworks are used by less than half of gamification research. There are numerous gamification frameworks and it is difficult to find a specific one.\r\nOur research aims to tackle this problem by providing a fast and easy process, that allows finding a gamification framework for a specific use case. We want to achieve this, by identifying selection and quality criteria and developing a method to match these criteria to a gamification framework. Succeeding this we will develop a tool, that allows the user to identify the most suited gamification frameworks for any combination of the selection criteria.",

      "abstract": "In competitive multiplayer online video games, teamwork is of utmost importance, implying high levels of interdependence between the joint outcomes of players.\r\nWhen engaging in such interdependent interactions, humans rely on trust to facilitate coordination of their individual behaviours.\r\nHowever, online games often take place between teams of strangers, with individual members having little to no information about each other than what they observe throughout the interaction itself. A better understanding of the social behaviours that are used by players to form trust could not only facilitate richer gaming experiences, but could also lead to insights about team interactions. \r\nAs such, this paper presents a first step towards understanding how and which types of in-game behaviour relate to trust formation.\r\nIn particular, we investigate a) which in-game behaviour were relevant for trust formation (first part of the study) and b) how they relate to the reported player's trust in their teammates (the second part of the study).\r\nThe first part consisted of interviews with League of Legends players in order to create a taxonomy of in-game behaviours relevant for trust formation. As for the second part, we ran a small-scale pilot study where participants played the game and then answered a questionnaire to measure their trust in their teammates.\r\nOur preliminary results present a taxonomy of in-game behaviours which can be used to annotate the games regarding trust behaviours.\r\nBased on the pilot study, the list of behaviours could be extended as to improve the results.\r\nThese findings can be used to research the role of trust formation in teamwork.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, watching movies and videos have become increasingly diverse. Some movie theaters offer aromas and vibrations in addition to sound and 2D/3D images that accompany the movie. However, most movies provide a single same experience to all the viewers. Another way to watch movies is through video distribution services that allow users to enjoy them anywhere without having to specify the location. \r\nIn this study, we proposed to automatically modulate the video playback speed according to the user's feeling of fear estimated from pulse-rate variability measured with a smartwatch.\r\nTen subjects watched a 10-minutes horror short movie in the standard way and with feeling-controlled playback speed modulation. After each viewing, they answered an impression evaluation questionnaire. The responses revealed that the modulation of playback speed amplified subjects' feeling of fear.",

      "abstract": "This work explores perceptions of performance enhancer usage in esports. Specifically, we explored the perception of: food and food supplements; non-medical use of prescription drugs; drugs with some social acceptance (e.g. alcohol, nicotine, cannabis); drugs with lower social acceptance (e.g., psychedelics, opioids); and non-invasive brain stimulation (e.g. transcranial direct current stimulation). A mixed-methods approach was used to triangulate findings around three data sets, including both prompted and unprompted online forum comments, as well as survey data. The studies evidence that players are willing to use or are already using enhancers to increase their in-game performance, and that players are generally concerned about the use of enhancers in professional esports contexts. Furthermore, the community perceives that a substantial number of e-athletes use enhancers. The core contribution of this work is a comprehensive investigation into perspectives of esports performance enhancement, which highlights the urgent need for further research, as well as regulation by esports leagues.",

      "abstract": "Children with dyslexia face extra challenges in reading and writing words. They need more learning exercises than children with typical development to acquire vocabulary, which is often repetitive and daunting. Research has shown that combining visuospatial information in practices helped children with dyslexia memorize words, especially the real-world physical context. Nevertheless, the existing word recognition and spelling training games for children with dyslexia were not able to leverage children's immediate vicinity. Therefore, we designed an augmented reality mobile game, CollectiAR, that uses computer vision to identify objects in the player's immediate vicinity and direct the player to learn words for these objects. Our formative study with two elementary school teachers and a first-grade pupil found that CollectiAR has the potential to be an integral part of teachers' instructional design and an engaging way for pupils to practice vocabulary exercises. Our teacher participants suggested that CollectiAR provide interfaces for teachers to participate in the game content design and computer vision model correction.",

      "abstract": "The advent of various in-game purchasing systems has led to several ethical concerns in contemporary gaming ecosystems, including the monetary dark patterns in game design and the potential harms on gamer welling by introducing cheating, gambling, and addictive mechanisms. These concerns have resulted in the rise of tensions regarding the impacts of in-game purchases on players who pay versus those who do not pay, such as their perceptions of \"fairness\" in highly competitive gaming contexts when spending is involved. Using 2,685 Reddit posts from five subreddits of popular online sports and card games that focus on player-to-player competition, we investigate how players of these games perceive fairness of their in-game purchases. This research expands our existing knowledge on ethical concerns and fairness in gaming by highlighting consumers’ (players’) diverse ethical judgments regarding the increasingly popular monetization mechanisms in modern gaming. It also highlights ethical dilemmas surrounding competition, spending, and enjoyment in online gaming and informs the design of future digital consumption systems for fairer, healthier, and more ethical gaming dynamics.

      "abstract": "There is an observed reduction in outdoor play in many parts of the world. Although interactive playgrounds exist that are placed at larger playgrounds, such interactive setups in the close vicinity are not yet omnipresent. In this interactivity contribution we showcase three interactive add-on prototypes for the small local playground equipment, that span a spectrum of opportunities. We include a story-based themed interaction of Dragon School, for instance breathing as a dragon with an echo effect. The second interaction Nuppu is a higher intensity variation of the add-on, where playground equipment have to be `conquered' by performing the appropriate action (i.e. swinging makes the swing go through a variation of colors). The third interaction Magic Climb, is a more location-specific design for climbing equipment where animal-themed stations are lit up in random order making animal sounds, after the accompanying sound is played they be activated by an action related to that animal such as floating your hand as a bee above a sensor triggering the next sound. Especially for the latter setup, it was easy to come up with different game variations by changing the rules kept by the players but using the same system interaction. However, that idea embodies through its variation a question that becomes more and more important and we want to discuss: How to design for cultivating this type of open-ended play towards others sessions and players in a digital age? As we know open-ended play is a promising endeavor where the activity of coming up with games is part of the game. At the same time we think for children new systems should be able to be used in some form within a short amount of time, and provide enough perspective on how to use them immediately.",

Here we present Persuasion Invasion, an educational game that uses Value-Adaptive Instruction to help students learn to engage in productive civil discourse. Throughout the game, players learn about the values that underpin our beliefs and barriers to productive discourse (e.g., tribalism). Importantly, players also practice key civil discourse skills like identifying shared values across political lines and engaging in perspective taking. In this paper, we discuss the unique challenges of designing educational games in the civics domain, how we addressed those challenges, and how students responded to our design. Our results suggest that in-game practice was associated with improved learning outcomes on key discourse skill assessments. These results, coupled with qualitative student feedback, support the development of transformative and meaningful games in the civil discourse space.",

      "abstract": "The size of most virtual environments exceeds the tracking space available for physical walking. One solution to this disparity is to extend the available walking range by augmenting users' actual movements. However, the resulting increase in visual flow can easily cause cybersickness. Therefore, we present a novel augmented-walking approach for virtual reality games. Our core concept is a virtual tunnel that spans the entire travel distance when viewed from the outside. However, its interior is only a fraction as long, allowing users to cover the distance by real walking. Whereas the tunnel hides the visual flow from the applied movement acceleration, windows on the tunnel's walls still reveal the actual expedited motion. Our evaluation reveals that our approach avoids cybersickness while enhancing physical activity and preserving presence. We finish our paper with a discussion of the design considerations and limitations of our proposed locomotion technique.",

      "abstract": "The power of video games in education is becoming more prominent because children and young adolescents nowadays spend more time than ever in the digital world. Previous studies have investigated the effectiveness of using games for learning concepts in computer science and even computer programming at the secondary level. However, games for learning concepts related to mathematics in computer science have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we introduce Dive In! Computer World Action, a platform game that allows players to learn Boolean operations in the context of computer science through fast-paced gameplay. The importance and usage of Boolean operations are also conveyed via in-game storytelling. The results of the playtesting suggested that Dive In! Computer World Action was effective in learning Boolean operations and related concepts. The participants generally welcomed the game-based approach. The nature of platform games also allows us further expand the gameplay for learning other mathematical operations and concepts in the context of computer science in the future.",

      "abstract": "Understanding players' mental models are crucial for game designers who wish to successfully integrate player-AI interactions into their game. However, game designers face the difficult challenge of anticipating how players model these AI agents during gameplay and how they may change their mental models with experience. In this work, we conduct a qualitative study to examine how a pair of players develop mental models of an adversarial AI player during gameplay in the multiplayer drawing game iNNk. We conducted ten gameplay sessions in which two players (n = 20, 10 pairs) worked together to defeat an AI player. As a result of our analysis, we uncovered two dominant dimensions that describe players' mental model development (i.e., focus and style). The first dimension describes the focus of development which refers to what players pay attention to for the development of their mental model (i.e., top-down vs. bottom-up focus). The second dimension describes the differences in the style of development, which refers to how players integrate new information into their mental model (i.e., systematic vs. reactive style). In our preliminary framework, we further note how players process a change when a discrepancy occurs, which we observed occur through comparisons (i.e., compare to other systems, compare to gameplay, compare to self). We offer these results as a preliminary framework for player mental model development to help game designers anticipate how different players may model adversarial AI players during gameplay.",

      "abstract": "This paper examines different gaze-based cue visualization techniques in a Virtual Reality (VR) exploration game. It is argued that gaze could be a valuable design tool for providing cues to players. However, little is known about how these elements could be visually presented and integrated to inform players and fit into the game world. An exploratory study was carried out to investigate four different design approaches (subtle, overlaid-virtual, integrated, emphasized) and their effects on aspects such as clarity, usefulness, and curiosity. In general, the visualizations led to different player impressions on all scales. While players perceived the subtle and emphasized variants as more aesthetically appealing, integrated and virtual-overlaid solutions received more positive ratings regarding tool-related aspects such as ease of extraction and accurateness. We anticipate future work could employ gaze-based cues in various application contexts based on their utility as eye input in VR games continues developing.",

      "abstract": "Pokémon GO is a popular location-based mobile game that seeks to inspire players to be more active, socialize physically and virtually, and spend more time outside. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, several game mechanics of Pokémon GO were changed to accommodate socially-distanced play. This research aims to understand the impacts of the pandemic and subsequent game adjustments on user perceptions of the game. We used an exploratory mixed-method approach, a machine learning technique (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) for topic modeling, and thematic analysis for qualitative coding of top-level Reddit comments to identify whether and how the social distancing approach changes the players’ behaviors. The results demonstrate that players were less physically active, less eager to discover, and more interested in remote social practices. We discuss which players leverage social distancing changes and reflect on key game features that provide a better gaming experience in the age of remote play.",

      "abstract": "Many games use engagement rewards as incentives for players to engage, e.g., daily login rewards, repeatable challenges, or seasonal rewards like holiday skins. These rewards may serve players by facilitating enjoyment or motivation; however, they may also be considered differently by skeptical players, e.g., as dark patterns that do not benefit players, and may detract from—or even harm—player experiences. As they are widely prevalent in a variety of games, it is important to understand how such rewards are experienced by players to inform potential pitfalls, such as when they are negative for gaming experience or lead to unhealthy gaming behaviours. 178 participants completed a mixed-methods survey and described such rewards in games they play, the tasks required to acquire them, and their experience qualitatively and with validated scales of motivation regulation and passion orientation. We found that players perceived these rewards as beneficial (e.g., as motivation), as negative (e.g., by promoting fear of missing out), or even as an obligation or chore. Quantitative results further support the dualistic experience of such rewards. We contribute findings and design recommendations that are useful for understanding and designing widely used but potentially detrimental reward mechanics.",

We present a fully implemented collaborative VR game, co-designed by Namibian school children. The team needs to solve puzzles, whereby one player, using a VR headset, enters the digital world of Candyland, communicating with the other teammates, who are using a printed puzzle book. Ten Namibian school children, split into three groups, evaluated the game. Both the children inside and outside of VR were excited and eager to play the game through, despite the game being too complex, with too little feedback and a number of design issues, which required much guidance from the researchers.",

Despite their wide use, the results after the use of gamified solutions are not always as good as expected. This can be due to several factors: there isn’t a standard procedure for gamification design, there’s a lack of methodological rigor and control over the data collection and data analysis. In this work, we present GamiDOC, a web-based solution to support designers during the software design, development and analysis through the use of a gamification design model and its review, a methods design control, an aid in the code generation, and an exhaustive list of standardized UX questionnaire according to the context of use.",

      "abstract": "Imagine you can explore virtual space just by regular walking, even if you are in the very confined tracking space of your living or bedroom. Redirection techniques aim to overcome physical space limitations and enhance capabilities for natural motion when exploring large-scale virtual environments, improving the sense of presence. Techniques include the covert manipulation of user position or rotation to altering the geometry of a virtual environment. Several methods are used to mask redirection techniques, such as the obstruction of view of a user, to using visual or auditory elements to divert the attention of users away from the redirection technique. One recurring masking strategy is the utilisation of a distractor, which attracts user attention by a visual or auditory object, or interactors, an object which engages the user in a series of focused interactions. We provide a simple framework to categorise various masking strategies, to create a general understanding of the usage and implementation of these masking techniques. To validate and demonstrate the usefulness of this framework, we map it against a collection of papers that use masking strategies in different contexts. We identify the types of masking strategies and provide a generalised implementation outline. This provides further insight and understanding of the inner workings of these attentional diversion methods.",

      "abstract": "The esports market has been growing exponentially with much interest from industry and academia.  Perhaps because of this growth, there is a lack of agreement on what esports actually encompasses. We conducted a systematic review of 461 peer reviewed, full papers that provide a definition of esports. Findings highlighted the growth of the esports field across different domains, and increasing global interest in esports, but a lack of consensus regarding definition of the term. Through thematic analysis we identified nine dimensions across esports definitions. We critically assess these dimensions in terms of their representativeness and utility in describing the multifaceted nature of esports. Our work may help create a shared understanding of what esports is— and is not—capturing a diversity of experiences within organized competitive gaming and supporting continued research growth in this increasingly important domain.",

      "abstract": "Immersive theatre is a highly interactive format that raises the audience’s agency over their experience, and, depending on their actions, provides each member with their own understanding of the overarching narrative that developed based on the spatial path they undertook. This theatre format challenges traditional theatre digitisation techniques as current archiving and reproduction methods cannot authentically replicate the affordances (or ‘actions possible’) that audiences have in the original performance. Theatres need to explore new methods of digitisation and archiving, to preserve past experiences and cater to an audience who will access content digitally. This report documents the design decisions and their impact for the interactive prototype digitisation and archival of the 2021 immersive-theatre production “Because the Night” for a digital audience. This interactive digital archive utilises game design and game engine technology to map and transfer the affordances of audiences from the original immersive theatre play to a digital platform, leveraging the game engine’s innate affordances, including freedom of movement, spatialised audio, and user intractability. To deliver these research outcomes, the project captured 360-degree video of the performance, music, images of props, and 360-degree photographs of the set, all embedded into a game engine system to authentically preserve the immersive, interactive, and ambient experience of the original production. The resulting system was able to successfully map several of the performances original affordances, including environmental exploration, spatially emergent narratives, object inspection and exploration, and interactive environmental challenges. This document reports on three matters: the design process and decisions to authentically capture the affordances of the theatre production in a digital gameplay experience; the current status of this research project; and the proposed approach to testing the prototype with users.

      "abstract": "Have you ever picked up a stuffed toy and pretended to play with it in your childhood? We are motivated by the novel use of stuffed toys in enhancing extended reality interaction. A key goal of extended reality is to induce the feeling of presence in its users. Naturally mapped control interface has been shown to enhance presence. The literature also indicates that a high degree of freedom tracking is important to extended reality. Based on these observations, we show that a free-form naturally mapped control interface is well-motivated via a theoretical contextualization. We explore the possibility of building such a controller in the form of stuffed toys. To realize stuffed toys as controllers, a novel soft-pose estimator empowered by cage-based deformation is proposed. It is shown to be effective in tracking the poses and deformations of real soft objects even by training with synthetic data only. Three gameplay prototypes are developed to demonstrate that interactive play can be enabled by the soft-pose estimator. They also form the basis for two user studies that validate the success of tracking stuffed toys with the soft-pose estimator for interactive play.",

      "abstract": "Likert-style questionnaires and surveys are commonly used tools for research. To alleviate survey-fatigue, researchers have explored gamification routes to increase engagement and lower drop-outs. However, these attempts still rely on direct use of questionnaire text and focus on creating engagement around the actual activity and do not fully alleviate the challenges of filling survey. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach involving the use of a serious game to capture user responses through in-game activities rather than direct questions. We chose the Food Choice Questionnaire (FCQ) and explored the design challenges of creating a serious game which deploys a sub-sample of the FCQ questions as four mini-game activities. The player actions and decisions are used to compute a result which is compared with their FCQ responses. We demonstrate the method to evaluate the equivalence of game results to the questionnaire responses. We discuss how future serious games can be designed and evaluated to generate similar outcomes while avoiding potential pitfalls through design and analysis.",

      "abstract": "Cutscenes form an integral part of many video games, but their creation is costly, time-consuming, and requires skills that many game developers lack. While AI has been leveraged to semi-automate cutscene production, the results typically lack the internal consistency and uniformity in style that is characteristic of professional human directors. We overcome this shortcoming with Cine-AI, an open-source procedural cinematography toolset capable of generating in-game cutscenes in the style of eminent human directors. Implemented in the popular game engine Unity, Cine-AI features a novel timeline and storyboard interface for design-time manipulation, combined with runtime cinematography automation. Via two user studies, each employing quantitative and qualitative measures, we demonstrate that Cine-AI generates cutscenes that people correctly associate with a target director, while providing above-average usability. Our director imitation dataset is publicly available, and can be extended by users and film enthusiasts.",

In the work presented here, we examine joy of movement through Puzzle Ball Hamster, a game in which players need to move and bounce on a large sensor-equipped gymnastic ball to make game input. We invite the attendees of CHI PLAY to engage with our game, explore their own experience of joy of movement, and to safely lead a little hamster to escape.",

Existing vocal therapy resources lack effective game interactivity and compelling character-driven storyworlds, both of which are known to increase motivation and engagement in learning, especially in a pediatric context. Many pediatric therapies, including voice therapy, depend upon creating psychologically safe environments for their patients to reduce stress, promote mindfulness and encourage self-regulation. Our project incorporates a feeling of safety (or coziness) into game development, along with character design, and expertise in developing children’s media as a case study for a voice therapy serious game.

      "abstract": "We use a Pokémon allegory to illustrate that current approaches to applying Self-Determination Theory (SDT) are reinforcing bad practice. SDT is to motivation research in HCI what Pikachu is to Ash in the Pokémon animated series: important, reliable, and powerful. However, just like Pikachu has its weaknesses (i.e., ground-type Pokémon) and should not be sent into every single battle, SDT is not the right tool for every single research question. While motivation should be seen as a function of situation and person [8, 13], SDT does not account for interindividual differences in need strength. We note that important aspects of motivation as a construct (e.g., arousal, frustration, satiation) are currently neglected in HCI and advocate for more precision with the terminology (e.g., distinguishing motivation from volition, goals, abilities, and personality). Deepening our understanding of motivation can provide valuable insights to researchers in games and play. We also suggest alternative theories of motivation which can be adopted by games and play research.",

Players’ coping strategies are limited to tools that focus on punishing toxic players (e.g., muting, blocking, reporting), which are inadequate and often misused. To address the needs of players experiencing toxicity, we took inspiration from research in other online spaces that provide support tools for targets of harassment. We iteratively designed and evaluated in-game tools to support targets of toxicity. While we found that most players prefer tools that explicitly address toxicity and increase feelings of control, we also found that tools that solely provide social or emotional support also decrease stress, increase feelings of control, and increase positive affect. Our findings suggest that players may benefit from variety in toxicity support tools that both explicitly address toxicity in the moment and help players cope after it has occurred.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Latency is inherently part of every interactive computing system and particularly important for video games. Previous work shows that constant latency above 25 ms reduces game experience and player performance. However, latency in the wild varies and is never constant due to multiple factors, such as updates in routing tables, users changing their location, or the system’s workload. It is unclear if switching latency impairs the gaming experience stronger than a constant high latency. To elucidate, we conducted an experiment with 264 participants playing a shooting video game induced with 0 ms, 33 ms, and 66 ms controlled latency. While playing, the game switched between different latency levels based on three frequencies. Our analysis shows that switching latency significantly impaired the participants’ flow. Additionally, we found effects on the perceived tension, the experienced challenge, and the players’ performance. We conclude that games should prioritize constant latency, even if that entails artificially adding latency.",

      "abstract": "Pro-social themes like empathy and wellbeing are gaining popularity within games to contrast the medium’s stigmatised explorations of themes like violence, often to catalyse reflection or even change players’ beliefs surrounding complex scenarios. These abstract themes can be classified as a game’s “values”: elements that are “useful or important” to game designers and their audience.\r\n\r\nExploration of values in games was spearheaded by Values at Play, which described how values manifest in games and advocated for their explicit consideration within games and their discourse. Frameworks such as empathy, ethical, and anti-oppressive design all discuss similar values, but present ontological diversity that makes it difficult to collate games and frameworks under the values-conscious design umbrella. Such frameworks also often focus on design approaches and small-scale prototypes but pay less attention to how values influence aspects like publication and play. As such, the present research examines values within each stage of a game’s lifecycle: design, development, publication, interaction, and reportage. Doing so provides an understanding of values in multiple game contexts. This provides new perspectives that form the basis of a taxonomy for values in games, which is then presented alongside practical questions for values-conscious designers, publishers, and players to guide its use. \r\n",

The Longest Walk was designed and developed using documentary process and interrogated through Narrative Portraits to authentically convey my father’s experience of living with depression and suicidal intent in an interactive experience with documentary quality. The game takes place on a walk over the Tay Road Bridge (Dundee, UK) – an infamous local landmark for those seeking to take their own life – and makes use of interview audio and point cloud data to strive for indexicality and as a method of expressive framing. This paper reflects on the interweaving of documentary practice with game design practice and serves as a demonstration of how a documentary-like quality can be achieved in games based on lived experiences.",

      "abstract": "Communication about chronic disease is challenging for affected children and their peers. However, peers play a crucial role in the quality of life, reduction of disease burden, and adherence to treatment regimens of children with chronic disease. Procedural rhetoric in games shows great promise to facilitate behaviour change leading to better communication between children with chronic diseases. We followed a user-centric design process to develop “It’s All in the Game”, exploring the value of procedural rhetoric to foster disease-related communication between children with cystic fibrosis—a chronic disease that affects the lungs and digestive system—and their peers.  Our work contributes to game design by showing an avenue to shape communication between peers and children with a chronic disease to potentially reduce disease burden and increase their quality of life.",

      "abstract": "With one-person households being increasingly common and Covid-19 lockdown policies forcing people to stay home, remote dining has become common practice for many, who take it as an opportunity to connect with others in times of loneliness. Sharing meals online, also known as digital commensality, is a rich form of interaction, where people leverage technology to achieve a sense of connectedness and belonging while eating. In this paper, we look at digital commensality and we explore its inherent playful potential with the aim to inspire the design of engaging technologies that can support, enhance and augment this form of interaction. For this, we used a situated play design approach to document and analyze the behavior of 36 people (including pairs of friends and strangers) sharing meals online. Our analysis surfaced a set of play potentials of remote dining -- i.e., playful things people already do and enjoy spontaneously while sharing meals online. We present those play potentials as inspirational material: they can motivate and enrich the design of future digital commensality technologies by responding to people's desire for playful and social interaction with, through, and around food.",

In this paper, we explore ways of putting time in perspective to promote climate change awareness by leveraging temporal-spatial dimensions in VR. On this basis, we designed, tested, and developed a Virtual Reality(VR) game, Oblivion, to demonstrate its potential to visualise what is invisible, enabling users to see and feel the time on the climate clock. Building on existing work on VR data visualisation and serious game regarding climate change, this study investigates how to translate real-world data into an immersive experience of climate change. With our ongoing work, we aim to investigate the impact of immersive visualisation of climate data on the user’s perception and understanding of climate change. The findings can contribute to discussing affordances and strategies for utilising VR as a persuasive medium to enhance climate change awareness.",

To investigate this opportunity, we designed a game called “Touchmate”. Here, one guesser and two suspects sit across with their legs hidden under a table. The guesser attaches a ground electrode from one EMS channel, and each suspect attaches one active electrode from the same channel on their forearms. When a suspect touches the guesser's leg, their bodies complete the electrical circuit, actuating both their hands involuntarily via the EMS. The guesser's goal is to determine who touched their leg. In this paper, we present the results from our initial study and articulate three player experience themes. Ultimately, we hope our work inspires game designers to create physical touch games using body-actuating technologies.",

      "abstract": "Several recent productions have explored how theatrical performances can be performed in virtual reality. Their audiences move around the show's virtual world, interact with its set, and listen to live performers. These virtual reality performances suggest a new form of digital play that utilizes the audience's embodiment in the world and participation in its story to immerse them in it. In this paper, we describe how audiences interacted with the virtual reality play You Should Have Stayed Home. We propose a design space for audio-visual entertainment media, use it to contextualize virtual reality theatre, and discuss how the show's use of virtual reality technologies shaped how audiences play it.",

      "abstract": "Rules, a quintessential property of any and every game, are one of the factors that influence player experiences. Online multiplayer games have two dimensions of rules that can be leveraged to improve player experiences – game rules that developers work with at the game design level and server rules that the player community creates and maintains. A few studies suggest that server rules can be leveraged to shape player experiences at the individual and community levels, but litle work has investigated the role of server rules in play communities tailored for youth. Te rise in online multiplayer gaming among youth motivates a need to understand how server rules shape the culture and climate of online communities. Using a mixed methods research approach, we analyzed server rules (1920) across 60 “in-the-wild” moderated Minecraf servers. We report on findings from a subset of 19 Minecraf servers explicitly tailored for young adolescents (475 rules). We offer a nuanced understanding of server rules in relation to youth developmental needs, particularly during early adolescence (ages 7-14 years) and discuss how server rules can be harnessed to shape positive player experiences in online gaming communities for all youth.",

      "abstract": "Early adolescence is a time of major social change; a strong sense of belonging (SB) and peer connectedness is an essential protective factor in mental health (MH) during that period. In this paper we introduce LINA, an augmented reality (AR) smartphone-based serious game played in school by an entire class (age 10+) together with their teacher, which aims to facilitate and improve peer interaction, SB and class climate, while creating a safe space to reflect on MH and external stressors related to family circumstance. LINA was developed through an interdisciplinary collaboration involving a playwright, software developers, psychologists and artists, via an iterative co-development process with young people. A prototype has been evaluated quantitatively for usability and qualitatively for efficacy in a study with 91 early adolescents (agemean=11.41). Results from the Game User Experience Satisfaction Scale (GUESS-18) and data from qualitative focus groups showed high acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the game. Using AR, a shared immersive narrative and collaborative gameplay in a shared physical space offers an opportunity to harness adolescent affinity for digital technology towards improving real-world social connection and SB.",

The sound beings are auditory entities living in community, evolving their sonic presence and behaviour through interactive exchanges with their surroundings. By combining multiple levels of reactivity and openness to interaction, we explore the notion of sonic dialogues established between the sound beings, and with each human participant who dwells in this space. The dialogic exchanges are conceived with the concept of musical phonemes, linguistic pieces that are combined, merged, extended and synchronised with each interchange to produce an interactive, orchestral piece.",

      "abstract": "This work explores the use of functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to assess cognitive activity during videogame play, and compare it to cognitive activity during cognitive tasks that assess executive control. To this end, we assessed haemodynamic response to videogame and cognitive tasks in the prefrontal cortex, each manipulated on a spectrum of difficulty. In our study (n = 37), we find that mental effort expended during videogame play did not differ from mental effort expended during cognitive tasks---and speculate that regional cognitive activity during gameplay is indicative of functions pertaining to memory encoding and retrieval, planning, and sustainment of attention. Our findings suggest the utility of fNIRS as a means to understand challenge as part of the player experience, and contest the popular conception of videogame play as cognitively undemanding entertainment. Further, we were successful in distinguishing between difficulty levels in the gameplay tasks, situating fNIRS as broadly useful for granular assessment of gameplay difficulty. As such, we contend that fNIRS is an effective and useful tool for generating high-resolution insights regarding cognition (and particularly the experience of difficulty) during gameplay.",

      "abstract": "The use of procedural content generation (PCG) in the context of video games has increased over the years as it provides an economical way to generate game content whilst enhancing their variety and replayability. For city-building games, this approach is often utilized to predefine map layouts, terrains, or cityscapes for the player. One core aspect of facilitating enjoyment in these games comes from creative expressivity. PCG, in this context, may support creativity by lowering the technical complexity for content creation, or it may hinder creativity by taking away control and freedom from the user. To examine these potential effects, this paper investigates if PCG has an impact on players’ creativity in the context of VR city-building games. We present a VR prototype that provides varying degrees of procedural content: No PCG, terrain generation, city generation, and full (city + terrain) generation. In a remote user study, these conditions were compared regarding their capability to support creativity. Statistical tests for equivalence revealed that the presence of PCG did not affect creativity in any way. Our work suggests that PCG can be a useful integration into city-building games without notably decreasing players’ ability to express themselves creatively.",

      "abstract": "While esports organizations are increasingly adopting practices of conventional sports teams, such as dedicated analysts and data-driven decision-making, video-based game review is still the primary mode of game analysis. In conventional sports, advances in data collection have introduced systems that allow for sketch-based querying of game situations. However, due to data limitations, as well as differences in the sport itself, esports has seen a dearth of such systems. In this paper, we leverage player tracking data for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) to develop ggViz, a visual analytics system that allows users to query a large esports data set through game state sketches to find similar game states. Users are guided to game states of interest using win probability charts and round icons, and can summarize collections of states through heatmaps. We motivate our design through interviews with esports experts to especially address the issue of game review. We demonstrate ggViz's utility through detailed case studies and expert interviews with coaches, managers, and analysts from professional esports teams.",

      "abstract": "Educational games have long been seen as having great potential, but evidence for their effectiveness is mixed, suggesting deficiencies in our theoretical understanding of learning in games and associated design principles. The principle of “Intrinsic integration” of learning content with game mechanics (Hapgood and Ainsworth, 2011) increases learning in educational games, but the theoretical mechanisms behind the principle are unclear, leading to implementation issues. In response, we performed a pre-registered study (n=210) to test possible motivational, cognitive load or attentional mechanisms for moderating learning at an abstract learning task within an educational game similar to Pacman. Learning was higher in the intrinsically integrated version with no significant effects of motivation or cognitive load leading to the conclusion that intrinsic integration increased learning via an attentional mechanism where players only pay attention to features needed for the game task and ignore task-irrelevant information.  We discuss theoretical implications for game learning as well as insights for designers of educational games. ",

Following a human-in-the-loop setup, we introduce the interactive visualization tool INSPECT that applies multiple configurable noise reduction, segmentation, and contrast functions in order to highlight systematic differences or points of interest within player behavior. With respect to self-directed learning among players in complex video games and the identification of erroneous decision making in educational games, we set up two case studies with domain experts using INSPECT that ascertained and interpreted crucial player decisions that led to optimal or inexpedient behavior.\r\n",

In this paper, focusing on low-effort customization, we considered giving users the choice between an absolute (seeing all opponents) and  a relative (seeing opponents that are just below and above their own rank) leaderboard in the context of image tagging. Results of two studies showed that, although the task performance is not affected significantly, offering this choice is appreciated, and users' preferences for the type of leaderboard are moderated by the number of opponents on it.",

      "abstract": "The perception of gamification elements differs across users, which is why personalizing gamified systems is important. Past research showed that the Hexad user types model is particularly suitable for this purpose by demonstrating correlations between user types and gamification elements. However, previous studies were mostly survey-based, i.e. relied on participants' rating of gamification elements based on textual descriptions or storyboards. Thus, the question whether personalization based on Hexad user types provides benefits in implemented gameful systems was neglected. We contribute to this by investigating the effects of (contra-) tailoring the set of gamification elements to a user's Hexad type on performance and user experience, assessed with survey and physiological measures, in an image tagging context. In a lab study (N=29), we found that gamification increases performance and affects psychophysiological measures of arousal. Moreover, we demonstrate that personalization increases enjoyment, positively-valenced affective experiences and participants' absorption in the task at hand. ",

We developed Eggventures, a platforming game for two players, to investigate how movement mechanics influence connectedness. In one version of the game, the two players are tied together with a rubber band and have to make use of it to catapult each other through the levels. In a between-subjects study, we compare this to a version with only jumping. We find that both versions offer an enjoyable experience, but that the rubber band version increased player communication. A likely contributor to this is the increased level of challenge and frustration that forced players to engage more with each other to succeed.",

We outline our workshop procedure and discuss how Let's Play video production may accommodate constructionist learning approaches. Finally, we present a first implementation of the playful workshop concept in two sessions in a fourth grade class in primary school. While the workshop was well received by students, some remaining practical hurdles are identified and addressed. ",

      "abstract": "Motives are essential concepts in understanding a player's experience in video games. We report and describe the analysis of a widely used questionnaire to measure players' motives in video games, the Motives for Online Gaming Questionnaire (MOGQ). The present research aimed to investigate the psychometric quality of the MOGQ in the context of League of Legends (LoL). The MOGQ is a 27-item self-report scale designed to measure the motives for playing online games. To this end, 256 participants completed an online survey asking about their experiences and motives to play LoL. Results of confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses indicate weaknesses in the original 7-factor model. By removing five conspicuous items from the original 7-factor model, we propose an alternative 22-item version of the MOGQ. Additional confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses results indicate that the 22-item version of the MOGQ is more suitable in the context of LoL than the original 27-item questionnaire. However, further investigation into the quality of this alternative version compared to the original questionnaire is needed.",

      "abstract": "Computational support for learning in the domain of esports has seen a great deal of attention in recent years as an effective means of helping players learn and reap the benefits of play. However, previous work has not examined the tools from a learning theory perspective to assess if learning is prompted and supported in the right place and time. As a first step towards addressing this gap, this paper presents the results of two studies: a review of existing computational tools, and an online survey of esports' players' learning needs supplemented with qualitative interviews. Using Zimmerman's Cyclical Phase Model of Self-Regulated Learning as a lens, we identify patterns in the types of support offered by existing tools and players' support interests during different learning phases. We identify 11 opportunities for future research and development to better support self-regulated learning in esports.",

A wider understanding of these concepts is vital to help make gut-friendly decisions in everyday life; however, its complexity can challenge public understanding if not approached systematically. Research suggests that board games can help to playfully navigate complex subjects. We present Gooey Gut Trail (GGT), a board game to help players understand the multifactorial interactions that influence and sustain gut microbial diversity. Through the embodied enactment of in-game activities, players learn how their habits surrounding diet, physical activity, emotions, and lifestyle influence the gut microbial population. A qualitative field study with 15 participants revealed important facets of our game design that increased participants’ awareness, causing them to reflect upon their habits that influence gut health. Drawing upon the study insights, we present five design considerations to aid future playful explorations on nurturing human-microbial relationships.",

      "abstract": "Persuasive games promote attitude and behavior change, of which reflection is an important precursor, but existing advice on designing for reflection is mixed and requires further empirical investigation. To address these concerns, we report on the design and evaluation (n=32) of a game to prompt student reflection on work-life balance. Participants either played as themselves or a third person character (Alex). An inductive qualitative analysis of post-play interviews, and a follow-up one week later, resulted in four themes that consider how gameplay facilitated reflection: making (sensible) consequences visible; it’s like MY life; the space between Alex and I; and triggers in everyday life. In addition, a deductive qualitative analysis indicated that while both games resulted in different forms of reflection for the majority of players, those who role-played as Alex appeared more likely to experience higher levels of reflection. Through exploring the different ways that the two versions of the game succeeded, and failed, to support reflection, we highlight the importance of providing a relevant context to players (so the game feels close to their experience), and allowing them to role-play as someone other than themselves (but not too close).",

We further engage with queer individuals who playtest our game and participate in focus groups to discuss how queer they felt our game was and what they regard as queer game mechanics. Participants had varying experiences while playing our game, ranging from serendipity and wonder to alienation and confusion. The focus groups described queer game mechanics as queer modes of play and often tapped into gender representation. Finally, we show how including and amplifying queer voices in discursive efforts around interactive technology design has implications for transformative and critical reflections that can broadly benefit game design and HCI research.",

      "abstract": "When facing mental health concerns, men seek help less, confront greater stigma in accessing treatment, and experience more severe consequences. Interventions targeted at men are often grounded in activity and situated in appealing contexts, such as sporting or gaming spaces. In this paper, we question how pinball---a social tangible and digital leisure activity---can support men’s mental health and wellbeing, through thematic analysis of in-depth semi-structured interviews (n=15) with male pinball enthusiasts. Our contribution is threefold: first, we evidence pinball as a context that provides incidental benefits to mental health directly, and indirectly through social connectedness; second, that enthusiasts actively enhance their social lives and resulting wellbeing via pinball; and third, that pinball contexts are suited for designing interventions that provide mental health supports within subcultures that appeal to men. We situate our findings in theories of wellbeing, activity-based communication, shoulder-to shoulder self-disclosure, and the importance of third-spaces for social wellness.",

      "abstract": "Visual indicators provide important in-game information, but displaying them on screen consumes space and increases clutter. Increasing indicator brightness above the levels possible in standard monitors can substantially improve accessibility. To address both aspects, we developed an ambient lighting system for video game indicators using an LED strip attached around the back border of a monitor. Our controlled study compares the speed, error rate, and perceived workload of this approach with an on-screen baseline method. Results show that ambient lights can capture attention 17.5\\% faster compared to on-screen indicators and ambient lights performed at least as well as on-screen across all other metrics. Our work provides empirical evidence that ambient lights can be an adequate replacement for on-screen indicators in games, allowing people to reclaim screen real estate and adjust brightness for accessibility without sacrificing performance.",

      "abstract": "Privacy Policies inform users about how their personal data is managed while fulfilling the obligatory requirements. Past studies have shown that users often do not read privacy policies, cannot comprehend the long and complex policy documents, and resort to providing their consent without knowledge. To enable users to make an informed decision, we explored serious games as a new medium to improve their understanding of privacy policies. In a mobile escape room game, users engage with the data collection and processing by solving different puzzles. We validated the game concept in a user study by comparing it to a conventional textual policy. Our findings show that the game promoted greater information recall in users. However, a trade-off seems to exist between frustration, duration and understanding. We show strategies for turning a privacy policy into game elements for a mobile escape room game and incorporating privacy information into different puzzles. We recommend that the choice of a privacy policy format should vary in a case-by-case scenario and should accommodate different target audiences.",

In many cases, this feedback is presented visually post-play but live companions that provide real-time analytics are gaining more and more attention. However, the design of such systems poses different requirements which have been little explored from a scholarly point of view. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we report on a study of two visualizations - a physical and digital one - providing live feedback to League of Legends players designed based on a community survey (N= 175) and expert input. We further discuss results of a qualitative evaluation with 13 players and an expert, touch upon potential benefits and drawbacks of physical and digital implementations, and present derived design considerations and challenges for such real-time data visualizations, revolving around issues of information density, contextualization, representation, and a diverse range of user needs.

      "abstract": "Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers are increasingly captivated by water interactions and hence explored interactive devices to support aquatic activities in different settings (e.g., mixed realities in water parks). However, our understanding of the user experience in interacting with water and technology is still underdeveloped. To begin closing this gap, we explore flotation tanks as a water setting for playful interactive experiences. The goal of the associated somaesthetic design approach was to sensitize the body of the designer (the first author) by engaging with her experiences interacting with water and create meaningful interactions. This preliminary work presents four different user experiences that can facilitate play through a defamiliarization analysis of water interaction with the body mediated by technology. We offer HCI insights for design researchers interested in creating playful experiences in water settings, while also providing industry with initial strategies on how to enrich flotation tank sessions.",

However, restrictions introduced to co-located events affected how both regular and casual players scheduled, organised, participated and engaged with various games. Through an online survey, we aimed to gain preliminary insights into how the swift switch from physical to remote play -- forced by the circumstances -- impacted the gameplay experiences and how different players potentially changed their playing habits. Our preliminary results suggest that computer-mediated communication systems successfully allowed the translation of co-located game sessions, but also highlight the emergence of different points of player friction during remote game experiences, e.g., the tediousness of scheduling and setup, miscommunication or playmates' wellbeing. We discuss future research and design opportunities that explore the potential to augment social game experiences at a distance and debate the future of remote or hybrid play.",

      "abstract": "There have been few changes to the current standard game controllers since the introduction of the Dual Analog Controller for the PlayStation in 1997. Refinements have been made and some unique active control schemes (e.g., Wii Remote) have been released. However, there has been minimal development of passive biometric player inputs (i.e., not directly and consciously controlled by the player). Passive biometric inputs have the potential to enhance player experience by tailoring the game based on the player's changing physiological state. In this paper, we report on the development and testing of a new prototype pressure sensor designed to be integrated into a game controller. The prototyping and testing undertaken as part of this report has produced a system that shows promise for inferring the activity and state of the player and for implementation into future controller designs. Such a system could be used to read and adapt to the emotional state of a player for a customised play experience.",

      "abstract": "The design and development of playful wearable devices is a challenging and complicated problem. It entails not only multidisciplinary expertise but also a comprehensive understanding of player experience. There is a scarcity of evidence-based studies in current state-of-art literature that investigate general design practices and provide pragmatic design implications and suggestions based on solid user-centered research. To bridge the gap, we developed five experience prototypes based on the speculative design concepts from previous studies, and a Wizard of Oz experiment was conducted to elicit end users' feedback regarding general gaming experience as well as specific design themes in different gaming scenarios. The user experiment results were analyzed qualitatively following a rigorous thematic analysis, generating five major design implications as output. We believe this study will offer forward-looking insights to designers, developers and the research community, facilitating future work in this field. ",

      "abstract": "This paper describes an automated evaluation of the overall game experience using a synthetic agent, that we contextualize for First-Person Shooter games. This evaluation method is based on the characterization of the game experience through dynamics of major FPS games. We define dynamics as sequences of events that are meaningful for the player during the game session. As they trigger players' emotional responses, and influence their overall enjoyment and motivation, we classify them according to Motives for Play like curiosity, thrill-seeking, problem-solving, victory, and acquisition, in order to facilitate the evaluation process. Based on that, our evaluation method proposes to select synthetic agent routines that target a distinct game experience while playing a game session, using a selection of game dynamics. As the agent navigates through the level and interacts with opponents, dynamics may occur and, if so, are automatically identified, and then classified as Motives for Play. In the end, this classification can be used to evaluate the game experience and the quality of the level itself during playtesting sessions. It may also be utilized to assist the procedural generation of any level that target a specific game experience.",

      "abstract": " The Covid-19 pandemic has influenced people’s views on work, and a significant portion of the global game industry converted to remote work during the pandemic. To explore the status of game development in this pivotal moment, we have conducted semi-structured interviews with 27 immigrant/expatriate game developers (“game expats”) in Finland analyzing their migration push and pull on societal, industrial, social, and individual factors. The results indicate societal and industrial factors simultaneously influencing game expats’ migration intention, but with an increasing influence of game corporation’s role on developers’ both on-the-job and off-the-job embeddedness due to an absence of (local) community activities during the pandemic. The data also reveals that game developers are valuing the physical workspace for face-to-face interactions, despite the industrial norm of digital tools and seamless transition to remote work. Furthermore, an alarming stratification and hierarchization within the game industry were identified, which game developers self-dividing in-house versus outsourced workforce even if they were both required to work remotely. This paper contributes to game studies on game developers’ experiences as an attempt to investigate the local context of game development. It is also one of the first snapshots of game work practices in Finland during the Covid-19 era.\r\n",

      "abstract": "The combination of narrative learning, creative engagement, and Social Emotional Learning seems to be a promising approach to explore different subjects in educational scenarios. Yet, the use of technology for viable classroom interventions still needs to be investigated. This work looks into the essential characteristics of an interactive digital learning arrangement (IDNLA) for guiding storytelling  to support Social Emotional Learning in the classroom. We conducted a study with an IDNLA authoring tool, named Fantastinomio, which facilitates storytelling through the choice of pictures, and aimed at promoting awareness on emotions through guided storytelling. The study was conducted in a Portuguese elementary school with a class of fourth-graders during three classroom sessions. The Fantastinomio's story library was entirely created by the children with their drawings, which functioned as story elements that were displayed as random image sequences, and acted as stimulus for creating a story. Here, we present and discuss children's representations of emotions in their drawings and in the stories they they produced. The results of this study indicate that it is possible to guide storytelling for the purpose of Social Emotional Learning in a classroom context, and that the intervention was positively influenced by the fact that the children authored the Fantastinomio’s library.  Thus, expressive authorship and open-ended design for authenticity acted as essential characteristics for guiding storytelling for meaningful Social Emotional Learning. In future work, we will conduct further studies with the Fantastinomio exploring narrative learning for various classroom settings and learning purposes.",

      "abstract": "Previous research has shown that children with autism face severe social collaboration challenges such as having issues with turn-taking, which is essential when developing social skills. However, few digital interventions have provided visual support for the development of turn-taking behaviour. To visually manifest the process of turn-taking, this research transformed a pong game into a two-player tablet game, i.e.,  StarRescue. In this paper, we introduce StarRescue's game design decisions and preliminary findings gathered from semi-structured interviews with teachers and parents of pre-school children with high-functioning autism. The results demonstrated that StarRescue has the potential to help children with autism improve their social behaviors. Furthermore, this research shed light on future tablet game design to enhance turn-based collaboration for children with autism.",

      "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has been becoming increasingly prevalent in daily lives of humans in various settings. One of the concerns for this technology in becoming mainstream is the isolation caused by today’s occlusive headsets. An aspect of isolation is related to restricted nonverbal communication between headset-wearing and outside users. To address this gap, we developed “Googly Eyes”, a system that acts for the outside users as a window into the eyes of the headset-wearing user. On a smartphone display that was attached to a FOVE head-mounted display (HMD), user’s eye movements were visualized in real time using eye-tracking data. Our main goal is to increase social communication between HMD and non-HMD users, hence increase social presence; and increase enjoyment through improved communication. This paper includes the motivation, design rationale, and implementation details of the Googly Eyes along with preliminary results from a pilot study session and preliminary user studies with a small cohort.",

In this preliminary study, we investigate the domain dependency of eight persuasive strategies implemented in two persuasive games. In a between-study of 31 participants, we investigated the perceived effectiveness of two similar persuasive games, implementing same set of strategies but focusing on two different domains: healthy eating and smoking cessation, with only changes in their context to suit each domain. Our results revealed that although there was no overall significant difference in the overall effectiveness of the two interventions, seven of the persuasive strategies implemented were significantly effective for healthy eating while only two of them were significantly effective for smoking cessation. We also present discussions from participants' comments of how to improve these features for future game design.",

      "abstract": "Professionals with programming abilities are in high demand, but despite this urgent need, there is a lack of student interest. Researchers argue that in order to increase interest in computing, students require more opportunities for early familiarization, an understanding of how computing can make contributions to society, greater exposure to programming, online self-learning, internships, more visible role models and exemplars, and greater connections to the real world. This project aims to create a game that allows players to perform tasks from three computing jobs (web development, game development, and data science). Using the game as a testbed, the first study will develop an understanding of how different game design decisions affect the career game's effectiveness at engendering career-related and player-related outcomes. The second study will develop an understanding of how the career game as a whole influence career-related and player-related outcomes. The career game will be an informal learning environment that can be accessed by anyone with a desktop computer.",

      "abstract": "Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) is one of the most successful game genres. MOBA games such as League of Legends have competitive environments where players race for their rank. In most MOBA games, a player’s rank is determined by the match result (win or lose). It seems natural because of the nature of team play, but in some sense, it is unfair because the players who put a lot of effort lose their rank just in case of loss and some players even get free-ride on teammates’ efforts in case of a win. To reduce the side-effects of the team-based ranking system and evaluate a player’s performance impartially, we propose a novel embedding model that converts a player’s actions into quantitative scores based on the actions’ respective contribution to the team’s victory. Our model is built using a sequence-based deep learning model with a novel loss function working on the team match.\r\nWe showed that our model can evaluate a player’s individual performance fairly and analyze the contributions of the player’s respective actions.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we searched the websites of 60 popular online multiplayer games to locate their codes of conduct and then performed a content analysis on 32 unique codes of conduct. Our analysis consisted of a two-cycle coding process including initial coding, and then pattern coding for clustering categories and themes together. Our aim was to better understand how game companies include codes of conduct on their websites and what content they include in the codes of conduct. The two-cycle coding process identified five main themes: (1) game company values, (2) expectations of players, (3) bad behaviors and rules, (4) moderation practices, and finally (5) document structure. Our findings suggest that codes of conduct are routinely inaccessible, if present at all, and that codes of conduct are often framed around punitive legal language that reflect policies of misconduct rather than expressing communal values and expectations. Our findings can help contribute towards community management in online games and make codes of conduct more accessible for all stakeholders in online gaming communities. We have also provided design recommendations and a design process that should help guide game companies looking to create value focused codes of conduct.",

To investigate the effects of auditory latency, we added auditory latency to a publicly available and latency-sensitive first-person shooter game. Using the game, we conducted a study with 24 participants playing the game with four different levels of auditory latency (0ms, 50ms, 100ms, 200ms). The results of a Bayesian analysis support a model with no true effect of auditory latency on game experience and player performance in first-person shooter games. Hence, our preliminary results indicate that auditory latency may not affect gamers with the same magnitude as visual latency.",

      "abstract": "A growing number of VR games are published in the market as head-mounted devices (HMD) become more widespread. However, most VR games are targeted for a single-player audience, and cross-platform VR experiences where multiple players are engaged have yet to be fully explored. In this paper, we propose a VR-mobile cross-platform game based on traditional Korean mythology, Seung-ee & Kkaebi. Our goal was to create an immersive and enjoyable experience for players for both mobile and VR players where they are physically co-located, increasing both co-presence and social interaction. Our game design focused on asymmetric competition and maximized the interactions between both platforms. The VR player plays the role of Jangseung (Seek), a Korean traditional totem pole, whereas the mobile user plays the role of Dokkaebi (Hide), a Korean mythological creature. Each platform has its unique skill set to interrupt each other to win the game, thus creating a highly immersive and co-present experience for both players. ",

      "abstract": "Physical inactivity and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle constitute a significant public health concern. Exergames try to tackle this problem by combining exercising with motivational gameplay. Another approach in sports science is the use of auditory-motor synchronization, the entrainment of movements to the rhythm of music. There are already commercially successful games making use of the combination of both, such as the popular VR rhythm game BeatSaber. However, unlike traditional exercise settings often relying on periodic movements that can be easily entrained to a rhythmic pulse, exergames typically offer an additional cognitive challenge through their gameplay and might be based more on reaction or memorization. That poses the question as to what extent the effects of auditory-motor synchronization can be transferred to exergames, and if the synchronization of music and gameplay facilitates the playing experience. We conducted a user study (N = 54) to investigate the effects of different degrees of synchronization between music and gameplay using the VR rhythm game BeatSaber. Results show significant effects on performance, perceived workload, and player experience between the synchronized and non-synchronized conditions, but the results seem to be strongly mediated by the ability of the participants to consciously perceive the synchronization differences.",

      "abstract": "In the context of game live-streams, we focus on whether audience influence options can be extended beyond the game, e.g., to the streamers' environment (e.g., controlling their room lighting), the streamers themselves (e.g., activating vibration feedback on their forearms) and the streamers' hardware and peripheral devices  (e.g., switching key bindings). An online study (n=81) showed that viewers have mixed feelings and that the context matters, as only a few game genres are assessed as suitable for such an experience. In a lab-study six streamers experienced the idea while playing a horror game. They saw appeal in extending the influence space, but also again highlighted that context matters and customization options are necessary. The studies hint that although this interactivity is from a technical perspective independent of the content streamed, in practice it is not, as the perception is moderated by e.g., the game and why the streamer is playing it.",

School teachers face several challenges in contextualizing these resources for students, who in turn are increasingly expected to become informed decision makers and develop action competence. Yet research towards shared spaces for teachers, students and designers to explore complexities of environment knowledge and issues remains insufficient. Our study looks at participatory research with school communities to explore tools and methods for co-creating educational activities for environmental awareness in peri-urban India. We aim to explore the challenges and opportunities in teacher practices through in-situ inquiry processes. We seek to understand how play within participatory approaches might allow exploration of teachers’ notions and practices of environmental awareness facilitation; and how we may design such approaches and interventions. In this PhD we seek to develop methods to engage teachers in design processes and develop a range of activity materials as cases.",

In this PhD, we aim to broaden our understanding of the concept of Work and how it affects player experiences like fun, flow, engagement, and immersion. We seek to explore Work through empirical studies. Since, analyzing in-game player experiences is a challenging task, one of our goals is to evaluate several methods like experience sampling, protocol analysis, interview etc. Our goal is to contribute towards the theory of Work, which might also find applications in other fields like gamification, purposeful games, and organizational psychology.",

      "abstract": "Bodily games often use players' physiology as input to provide output via screen-based modalities. Game design researchers could extend the use of the body as input and output (I/O) by using body-actuating technologies such as Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS). EMS works by passing a small amount of electricity via electrodes attached to the player's body, contracting their muscles to actuate involuntary body movements. Our work explores this bodily I/O by creating three \"body-actuated play\" systems ranging from single-player to social game experiences. Ultimately, by studying the associated user experiences of these systems, we will deduce a prescriptive design framework for designing bodily games in which humans can use their bodies as input and output.",

      "abstract": "Understanding player motivations is crucial for the games industry, as it empowers developers to improve how their games are designed. Each player is different and possesses their own motivations to play. Motivations can vary greatly, ranging from socializing with friends to the challenge of overcoming a difficult boss. Many studies have\r\ntried to quantify these desires into models to allow game developers to better understand what drives players to play their games. As the industry evolves, so too must these models in order to account for emerging motivations of play. This research will explore the\r\ndevelopment of a new typology, extending the outcomes of the last three decades of player motivation research.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays children are more and more focused on playing social games with their peers through technological devices staying most of the time immobile indoors. Pervasive games and location-based mobile games, such as Pokémon Go, have a stand against this negative phenomenon as gameplay takes place outdoors with the city as the game arena. However, there are still many possibilities to encourage children to actually play together outdoors and simultaneously challenge themselves to fitness gain via physical exercise as they used to do in the traditional social outdoor games, such as tag game. In this work in progress paper, we aim on adding challenge to the gameplay as well as enriching the haptic player and social experience of the tag game by design, crafting and implementation of a two-piece social gaming wearable, HIPPA (figure 1 a-c). HIPPA is aimed to offer a more competitive and fun tag player experience.",

Considering that AR experiences are valued for taking advantage of the physical environment to situate the experience and increase the sense of realism and immersion, there are surprisingly few examples of research that have examined factors that contribute to player experiences in horror games. We developed an AR horror experience in which players need to enter an escape room, solve puzzles and retrieve a teddy bear under the threat of being captured by an enemy NPC. We conducted a study in which players completed the task twice, once facing the enemy NPC in the form of a human-like janitor and another with a robot. Most players rated the human-like enemy as more intimidating than the robot. Players provided various explanations for game elements that contributed to their sense of fear and intimidation including the sound, relatability of the enemy, and scary atmosphere.",

      "abstract": "Flow is a highly influential concept across many research domains. Because of the close links between enjoyment and flow, it is also a central concept in game research. Accordingly, many measurement instruments in the form of questionnaires have been developed to measure flow in video games. However, limited independent validation work has been carried out to date. In this project, we evaluated the recently developed Video Game Dispositional Flow Scale (VGDFS) in the context of League of Legends. An online survey posted on the online community reddit.com yielded a sample of N = 140. Confirmatory factor analysis did not support the originally proposed structure. Subsequent exploratory factor analysis resulted in inconclusive findings. Convergent validity with other questionnaires for the measurement of interest, enjoyment, and flow could be demonstrated in our data, although with unusually high correlations between the VGDFS and another flow measure. For divergent validity, correlations with questionnaires for the measurement of boredom and trait anxiety in the hypothesized direction could be found. Findings suggest that the VGDFS needs further evaluation in different video game contexts while also hinting at measurement problems possibly related to conceptual issues with flow.",

In the gaming domain, however, there are few high-quality datasets providing both: (1) visual gameplay data and (2) additional information about the gameplay, such as user input.  As a result, game researchers most of the time have to collect, process, and annotate gameplay data in time-consuming data collection studies themselves. We start closing this gap, by presenting a novel Counter-Strike: Global Offensive dataset. The contributed dataset is a collection of 12 high-skilled players playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. We showcase two deep learning-based examples using the presented dataset, demonstrating its versatility. ",

      "abstract": "Team cohesion is a widely known predictor of performance and collaborative satisfaction. However, how it develops and can be assessed,especially in fast-paced ad hoc dynamic teams, remains unclear. An unobtrusive and objective behavioural measure of cohesion would help identify determinants of cohesion in these teams. We investigated team communication as a potential measure in a mixed-methods study with 48 teams (𝑛=135) in the digital game League of Legends. We first established that cohesion shows similar performance and satisfaction in League of Legends teams as in non-game teams and confirmed a positive relationship between communication word frequency and cohesion. Further, we conducted an in-depth exploratory qualitative analysis of the communication sequences in a high-cohesion and a low-cohesion team. High-cohesion is associated with sequences of apology→encouragement,suggestion→agree/acknowledge, answer→answer, and answer→question, while low-cohesion is associated with sequences of opinion/analysis→opinion/analysis, disagree→disagree, command→disagree, and frustration→frustration. Our findings also show that cohesion is important to team satisfaction independently of the match outcomes. We highlight that communication sequences are more useful than frequencies to determine team cohesion via player interactions",

      "abstract": "Questionnaires are vital in games user research (GUR) to assess player experience (PX). However, having too many questions in surveys prevents wider uptake among GUR professionals because of games' rapid production cycles. To address this issue, we present the \\textit{miniPXI}---an eleven-item measure of the popular Player Experience Inventory (PXI)---providing single items for each of its eleven constructs. To develop the scale and examine its reliability and validity, we present three studies, conducted with 15 experts and 628 digital game players across continents. In the first survey study ($n=366$, 15 experts), single items were selected. In a second survey study ($n=232$), we explored reliability and validity of the single-item scale. Participants completed both full and single-item (SI) variants in three days. In the last study ($n=30$), we established the validity and sensitivity via an experimental evaluation of two games. The results are nuanced; SI reliability estimates for PXI constructs range from $.51$ to $.83$ with an average of $.68$, we could confirm the validity for nine constructs. We conclude that the miniPXI can be a valuable tool for PX evaluations where a longer measure is not feasible, and provide practical considerations for its use.",
