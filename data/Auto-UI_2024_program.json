Through a gesture elicitation study using motion capture technology, we first identified a set of whole-body gestures suitable for in-car driver assistance. We then recreated the selected gestures by acting them out and recording them as animations. The selected gestures were then evaluated and mapped to different driving-related scenarios in the second study conducted in a simulated in-car condition. The most promising gestures for an embodied in-car driving assistant were pointing towards a certain direction, showing warning signs by crossing the arms either on the chest or arms on top of the head, and performing waving gestures to alert or to grasp the driver's attention. By charting the potential signaling gestures, we aim to advance the development of more intuitive in-car guidance systems, ultimately promoting road safety.",

      "abstract": "Automotive manufacturers are continually looking for a competitive edge which may include implementing novel user interface solutions. This research aimed to understand how novel location and control type impacts on the discoverability of vehicle functions. Participants were asked to complete visual search tasks in two virtual vehicle interiors (wearing a virtual reality headset) where control types and their locations either met the de facto industry standard or did not. The tasks were repeated four times for each interior. Results showed that the mean search time and number of errors were higher when the control type or location did not align with the de facto standard. Furthermore, a novel location was found to have a greater impact on search time. However, the number of errors was greater when searching for a novel control type. The findings suggest moving away from de facto standards should be carefully considered by automotive manufacturers.",

      "abstract": "When employing autonomous driving technology in logistics, small autonomous delivery vehicles (aka delivery robots) encounter challenges different from passenger vehicles when interacting with other road users. We conducted an online video survey as a pre-study and found that autonomous delivery vehicles need external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) to ask for help due to their small size and functional limitations. Inspired by everyday human communication, we chose arms as eHMI to show their request through limb motion and gesture. We held an in-house workshop to identify the arm’s requirements for designing a specific arm with shrink-ability (conspicuous when delivering messages but not affect traffic at other times). We prototyped a small delivery robot with a shrinkable arm and filmed the experiment videos. We conducted two studies (a video-based and a 360-degree-photo VR-based) with 18 participants. We demonstrated that arm-on-delivery robots can increase interaction efficiency by drawing more attention and communicating specific information.",

      "abstract": "A method is presented for enhancing the steering maneuvers of human drivers using peripheral visual information generated based on the vehicle’s lateral positions on the road. Human drivers control vehicles mainly using visual feedback information received from the road. However, such feedback may sometimes become degraded due to various reasons. On the other hand, recent advances in sensory technologies make it possible to detect vehicle behavior on the road quite stably. In this paper, we investigate a way to compensate such impaired feedback using artificial visual stimuli. A series of LED devices were installed in the car’s doors to display the stimuli. We designed three types of illumination patterns (flow, position, and width conditions) that react to the current lateral position of the vehicle. Simulated driving studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of each pattern on the driver’s control of the vehicle. As a result, we found that the presenting the artificial visual stimuli without explanation could significantly reduce inappropriate steering maneuvers in the degraded feedback situations.",

Our study explores low-{\\textmu} (low friction) emulation, simulating icy conditions to facilitate drift training at safer, lower speeds. This approach not only enhances safety and mitigates fear by reducing the required speed for drifting, but also extends the time for them to react. A between-group design was employed, comparing drift training outcomes between participants trained exclusively in higher-{\\textmu} conditions (control group) and those who trained initially in lower-{\\textmu} conditions before transitioning to higher-{\\textmu} conditions (target group). The performance was assessed through the average distance of continuous sliding, along with subjective measures of motivation and workload. The results showed that the target group achieved greater slide distances in the retention session and reported higher scores on the positive intrinsic motivation factors, suggesting enhanced performance and engagement.",

      "abstract": "The Development of Fully Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) would fundamentally change the nature of in-vehicle user interactions, behaviors, needs, and activities. Passengers free from driving would expect to undertake diverse Non-Driving-Related Tasks to keep themselves occupied. Introducing Conversational Artificial Intelligence (CAI) in Level 5 AVs could improve the in-vehicle user experience (UX). To explore this, firstly, we identify what roles and relationships can CAI play towards end-users of AVs through end-user interviews and thematic analysis. Secondly, we examine how end-users qualitatively assess the embodied UX of the CAI roles and relationships through guided brainstorming, post simulator interaction experiments  employing Wizard of Oz setup and Participant Enactment methods. Results show that Tour Guide, Mentor, and Storyteller were the most preferred CAI roles, and that Human-CAI relationships are maintained if the CAI mediates in-vehicle user activities, interactions, sharing of vehicle control, and deep conversations. We discuss the research implications and propose design guidelines.",

      "abstract": "Research has characterized mind-wandering as humans' natural mental state, with moments of task-focused attention being the exception. With this framing, mind-wandering while driving likely occurs more than generally acknowledged, and seems poised to increase with higher levels of automation. This in turn may have adverse effects on drivers' abilities to regain situation awareness or resume control when needed. Of the prior work on detecting mind-wandering while driving, none focuses on automation or complex urban environments. We ran an exploratory study (N=14) of an automated drive through New York City in a two-dimensional virtual reality context, focusing on physiological measures such as gaze distribution, pupillometry, and heart rate. We also explored how drivers missing critical events may be a potential new measure. Results varied between focused and mind-wandering mental states and between moving and stopped driving contexts. These observations are an initial step toward understanding mind-wandering across diverse driving scenarios. ",

      "abstract": "For people who are blind and low vision (BLV), ridesharing provides an important means of independence and mobility. However, a common challenge relates to finding the vehicle when it arrives to an unanticipated location. Although coordinating with the driver for assistance is serviceable in the near term, new solutions are necessary when a human is no longer available in future automated vehicles. Therefore, this paper presents and evaluates a multisensory smartphone-based map system designed to enable nonvisual tracking of summoned vehicles. Results from a user study with (N=12) BLV users suggest that vibro-audio maps (VAMs) promote superior spatial confidence and reasoning compared to current nonvisual audio interfaces in ridesharing apps, while also being desirable and easy to use. A subsequent expert evaluation based on improvements suggested during the user study indicate the practical utility of VAMs to address both current and future wayfinding challenges for BLV travelers.",

These behaviors are crucial for the smooth functioning of an interdependent transportation environment, mitigating challenges from the integration of AVs and human-operated systems, and enhancing user well-being by fostering more efficient, less stressful, and inclusive environments. This study explores the impact of receiving prosocial behaviors on cognition, riding behavior, and well-being of micromobility users through interdependent traffic situations within a simulated urban environment. Our mixed design study involved two types of social interactions as between-subject conditions of prosocial and asocial interaction, and three categories of time constraint as within-subject conditions: relaxed, neutral, and pressed. The findings reveal that receiving prosocial and asocial behaviors can affect the state of well-being and trial performance in a mobility environment.",

      "abstract": "The advancement of automated driving technologies is fundamentally transforming the relationship between humans and vehicles, shifting from direct control to a more collaborative dynamic. Consequently, the design of in-vehicle Human-Machine Interfaces (iHMIs) is becoming increasingly intricate, focusing on aspects beyond mechanics and ergonomics towards enriched interaction and enhanced user experience. This shift has prompted research efforts to explore and advance iHMI concepts. Despite the iterative nature of design and its role in knowledge creation, our high-level understanding of the design processes utilised in iHMI development remains limited. To provide a comprehensive overview, this paper presents a scoping review of 324 papers (2013—2023) focused on the design underpinnings of iHMI development. Our review presents a categorisation of study goals and a detailed classification of five key stages within the design process. Based on these analyses, we discuss the influence of design and identify potential avenues for future research on iHMIs. ",

      "abstract": "The Wizard-of-Oz method has been widely used recently as it allows mimicking automated vehicles with relatively few resources. In some studies, it is challenging to ensure that the wizard remains fully hidden from participants, despite this being a crucial aspect of such experiments. To determine whether participants' awareness of the wizard influences the outcomes of these studies, we conducted an experiment investigating participants' crossing behavior and subjective perception of a remote-controlled automated vehicle. Participants were exposed to two conditions: in one, they solely focused on a simulated vehicle driving autonomously; in the other, they observed a wizard with a remote control and were instructed to imagine the car was automated. Results, based on scales for user experience, acceptance, and trust, as well as crossing behavior, indicate similar results. However, participants’ knowledge of the wizard necessitates careful interpretation when system errors are simulated. We conclude with recommendations for future Wizard-of-Oz experiments. ",

      "abstract": "As vehicle automation advances to SAE Levels 3 to 5, transitioning driving control from human to system, ensuring automated vehicles (AVs) align with user preferences becomes a challenge. Natural interaction emerges as a common goal, offering ways to convey user interests in a user-friendly manner. However, technical, legal, or design constraints may prevent fulfilling these preferences, leading to potential conflicts. Through an online survey (N=50), potential driver-passenger conflicts and their handling strategies were explored. Subsequently, in a Virtual Reality study (N=14), we applied identified strategies (ranging from distracting to motivating and adhering to social norms) to user-AV interactions using a state-of-the-art language model (GPT-4 Turbo) primed with the strategies to simulate realistic dialogues. Additionally, adaptive communication was compared to non-adaptive communication. Our findings reveal a preference for adaptive communication. Yet, despite using advanced modeling, accurately predicting user interactions remained challenging, with users often trying to outsmart the AI.",

Similar to personal AVs, passengers in SAVs might be utilized for this purpose, thus, methods for interaction between passengers and the automation or a teleoperator need to be explored. This study investigates whether the presence of other passengers leads to more passive behavior in critical situations (bystander effect). The results did not show significant differences in the participants' behavior depending on whether the ride was experienced alone or with other passengers. However, the qualitative data indicate that the presence of other passengers can trigger psychological processes that promote a bystander effect. The findings emphasize the importance of considering group effects in the context of SAVs. By understanding these dynamics, we aim to help design SAVs to promote safer and more inclusive future transport systems.",

Despite existing definitions and measurements, little is known about what constitutes the concept of situations from users’ perspective, i.e., do they have a similar or different understanding of situation dynamics? Therefore, we conducted a video-based experiment where participants had to mark the onset of new situations from their perspective, provide a continuous criticality rating, and justify their decisions in a post-test interview. Our results indicate that the understanding of situations, their complexity, and their duration is quite diverse between people and independent of properties such as age, gender, or driving experience, while partly being influenced by the road type. Additionally, we found correlations between subjective situation durations, criticality ratings, and algorithm output, which can be exploited by future applications and experiments.",

      "abstract": "Amidst the replication crisis, it is increasingly clear that we need to understand contextual factors that drive participant behavior, because those factors influence the applicability of study findings more broadly. For AutoUI, as we conduct interaction studies involving drivers, pedestrians, and other traffic participants, it is useful to characterize the traffic contexts that human participants are familiar with, because their prior experiences with traffic are likely to influence their behaviors within the context of a controlled study. To address this, we propose a new method, 'POV (point-of-view) camera-driven urban fingerprinting,' which can be used to characterize differentiating features of urban environments. We introduce two approaches, Small-Scale Custom Instrumentation, and Large-Scale Collection and Aggregation, and show how they can be used to acquire a broad picture on the characteristics of any city. One key benefit of POV camera-based data collection  is that it better captures the experiential aspects of traffic and road scenes than methods such as satellite imaging. This work is the first to formalize a specification for this data collection method by describing existing work and outlining standards to serve as a baseline for downstream research. This work posits the medium of crowd-sourced POVcam as a new and useful tool for transportation/ automotive interaction studies and infrastructure analysis. Subsequently, we provide future researchers with guidelines for characterizing urban traffic in cities for interaction study design. \r\n",

Non-designers may find it challenging to brainstorm interfaces for unfamiliar technology like AVs. Therefore, we explore using an immersive virtual environment to enable expert and non-expert designers to actively participate in the design phases. We built AV-Sketch, an in-situ (on-site) simulator that allows the creation of automotive interfaces while being immersed in VR depicting diverse AV-passenger interactions. At first, we conducted a participatory design study (𝑁=15) by utilizing PICTIVE (Plastic Interface for Collaborative Technology) to conceptualize human-machine interfaces for AV passengers. The findings led to the design of AV-Sketch, which we tested in a design session (𝑁=10), assessing users’ design experiences. Overall, participants felt more engaged and confident with the in-situ experience, enabling better contextualization of design ideas in real-world scenarios, with improved spatial considerations and dynamic aspects of in-vehicle interfaces.",

To further improve safety and driver engagement, we compared a fully shared longitudinal control system, which permits speed adjustments via acceleration and braking without deactivation, with a conventional system that disengages upon braking. In a simulator study involving 61 participants, both systems were well-received in terms of acceptance and user experience. The fully shared longitudinal control led to more frequent and earlier braking, suggesting anticipatory driving, without compromising perceived safety. Furthermore, it outperformed in hedonic qualities of user experience, and elicited a stronger intention to use. Our findings indicate that fully shared longitudinal control can enhance driver engagement, offering a valuable improvement for L2 automated systems.",

We conducted two driving simulator experiments to examine how different cognitive demands of texting, priorities, and takeover time budgets affect drivers' takeover strategies. We also evaluated how different takeover strategies affect takeover performance. We found that the choice of takeover strategy was influenced by the priority and takeover time budget but not by the cognitive demand of the NDRT. The takeover strategy did not have any effect on takeover quality or NDRT engagement but influenced takeover timing.",

An on-road study was conducted to investigate the mental model development while interacting with a state-of-the-art ADAS in both a rural (less complex) and an urban context (more complex). Forty-six participants experienced two rounds of each context. After each round, drivers rated their mental model, acceptance, and trust. Results indicate that for the rural context participants learned the system functionality in the first round without further improvement . In the urban context the mental model was generally less accurate, but improved in the second round. Trust increased from the first to the second rural round while acceptance did not show a significant change within the context. The results provide a first glimpse into the importance of evaluating different contexts and interaction scenarios for ADAS.",

To provide an in-depth understanding of such behaviors, we studied interactions between AVs (shuttles, personal cars, delivery robots) and other road users on highways, urban roads, and pedestrian areas based on extensive data from 6 real-world tests in France. These interactions were categorized into prototypical cases, which were analyzed using a descriptive model we developed to capture their situational, motivational, and behavioral factors. The results show that uncivil behavioral patterns involve mixed emotional and trajectory management, focusing on displacement, space sharing, or personal interaction. Uncivil behavior is thus defined by its disrespectful outcomes on traffic fluidity, disputed right of way, and personal offense (e.g., space intrusion, aggressivity, griefing of AVs). Improved infrastructure, better information for other road users, and enhanced AV behavior could mitigate uncivil behaviors and facilitate AV acceptance.",

However, cyclists using multiple independent interfaces could receive redundant or contradictory messages, causing unsafe encounters. We introduce the \\emph{Holistic AV-Cyclist Interface}: multiple displays facilitating communication together to ensure safe road sharing. We used participatory design with cyclists and HCI researchers (N=12) to develop holistic interfaces around an actual vehicle equipped with an eHMI. Participants created holistic interfaces communicating blindspot warnings and AV intent and accommodating two-way communication, e.g. through on-bike directional indicators. They mostly placed interfaces on the bicycle handlebars and cycling accessories, e.g. helmet. Holistic interfaces could overcome design challenges: they can be multimodal, facilitate communication between AVs and multiple cyclists, and work in varying weather/visibility conditions. We categorised participant designs into a taxonomy and developed a novel holistic interface based on our findings. Our results are important for the safe integration of AVs into traffic.",

We investigated three console designs with front surface angles of 45°, 90° and 135°. The initial study assessed how users interact with these three prototypes. Subsequently, we examined the ease with which users could reach across the different shapes. Additionally, we conducted a gesture elicitation study styled on guessability with the 135° model, focusing on user interaction with four applications: a radial menu, a 2D menu, car seat adjustments, and map navigation. Summarizing, this work aims to create a central console that is ergonomic, minimalist, and utilizes surface gestures, setting a new standard for future car interiors.",

      "abstract": "Research on cycling safety has recently gained the attention of the HCI community. While there have been multiple proposals for automated driving features on bikes, we are unaware of a project that systematically aims to translate and evaluate driver assistance systems from the automotive to the bike domain to promote cycling safety in traffic. Thus, we implemented an adaptive cruise control and a lane-keeping/centering system with hard- and software on a motion-based bicycle simulator and investigated their potential in a virtual reality experiment. Based on performance measurements and subjective ratings, results showed significant improvements in technology acceptance, subjective workload, and driving performance regarding the cruise control. In contrast, the lane-centering and lane-keeping features were rated significantly worse than the baseline without such assistance. The paper concludes with a critical reflection on automated driving features for bicycles and a list of recommendations for future projects in this field. ",

      "abstract": "Interacting with in-vehicle infotainment screens (IVIS) while driving influences how drivers allocate attention to the road, which can affect task and driving proficiency. Haptic feedback in IVIs has emerged as a promising avenue to support drivers’ interactions. Little is known about the impact of diverse feedback modalities on different types of interactions commonly carried out when interacting with IVIS. Two studies were conducted utilising production vehicles to understand the effects of IVIS featuring haptic feedback modalities (vibration and force touch) compared to other modalities (audio-only and no haptic feedback) for different types of interactions. Findings indicate that vibration and audio-only feedback supported drivers’ attention to the road and increased task performance in most types of interactions. Conversely, force touch did not support the driver and yielded the same results as having no haptic feedback. These results can support the design and enhancement of IVIS systems to support the drivers.",

We introduce EcoSimLab, a comprehensive electric vehicle driving simulation framework consisting of (1) a simulation of electric vehicle energy dynamics, (2) an optimization-based approach of structuring eco-driving behaviors, (3) a synthetic driver module as versatile benchmark model to analyze human behavior. Guided by fundamentals of energy modeling and considerations on human action regulation, we further present the development of the EcoDrivingTestPark, an exemplary set of energy-relevant scenarios to enable the analysis of individual differences in eco-driving and intervention effects (e.g., HMIs). To generate a first characterization of driving behavior, we conducted two empirical studies with human (𝑁S1 = 31, 𝑁S2a = 41) and synthetic drivers (𝑁S2b = 3). Results indicate substantial variations in driver behavior and considerable challenges for human drivers to achieve synthetic driver performance. Implications for augmenting human action regulation in eco-driving are discussed.",

While the focus of these advantages is on improving the driving task, it is also important that a user feels in control and perceives influence over the in-vehicle system. This is known as the user’s sense of agency in psychology, and sensory feedback is a key aspect. The current study involved a dual-task driving (simulator) and gesture-controlled infotainment interaction, accompanied by mid-air haptic or audio feedback. With 30 participants, we utilized an experimental approach with implicit and explicit measures of agency, as well as trust and usability. Results illustrated no difference in explicit judgements of agency, however mid-air haptic feedback improved the implicit feeling. More trust was also reported in the system with mid-air haptics. Our findings provide empirical evidence for mid-air haptics fostering user agency and trust in gesture-based automotive UI.",

However, the higher speeds associated with e-bikes pose an increased risk of potential accidents and hinder fluid riding in swarms with conventional bicycles. In this paper, we analyze the accuracy of maintaining an unknown speed, assess the associated workload, and investigate the self-reported speeds of e-bike cyclists in order to adapt the electric assistance to dynamic speed limits based on the surrounding traffic conditions. Our results from a pilot study with 15 participants show that the accuracy of maintaining a speed limit through active motor control and the associated workload are influenced by factors such as the level of electrical assistance and the perception of motor disengagement. E-bike cyclists using higher levels of electrical assistance demonstrated more accurate target speed maintenance. On average, participants consistently underestimated adapted speed limits, which were also influenced by the level of electrical support.",

      "abstract": "The proportion of highly automated vehicles in traffic (i.e., the prevalence of AVs) is likely to increase over time. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the prevalence of AVs may influence how pedestrians interact with AVs and with conventional, human-driven vehicles (CVs). A video-based laboratory study was conducted using a two-group mixed design. Participants took the perspective of pedestrians about to cross the road in a situation where AVs (with eHMIs) and CVs were approaching their position. The prevalence of AVs was manipulated between groups (low/high). The participants indicated the moment they decided to cross in front of the vehicles. Our results show that AV prevalence did indeed significantly influence when participants decided to cross. Overall, participants decided to cross earlier in front of the more prevalent vehicle type. Therefore, taking into account the given prevalence of AVs could significantly benefit AVs in predicting pedestrian behavior.",

In the present study, we investigated to what extent needs predict ODR use, and to what extent ODR need satisfaction is comparable to key transportation modes. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal study spanning three months with weekly online surveys. Longitudinal data were available from \\textit{N} = 29 participants (\\textit{N} = 55 for cross-sectional analysis).\r\nResults showed that need fulfillment significantly predicted ODR use, especially perceived competence. A discrete dimensions analyses showed that autonomy and competence were significantly predicting higher ODR usage. Comparing ODR and public bus, significant differences were found in all need dimensions; ODR performed consistently better. In comparing ODR and car, the only significant difference was monetary related; ODR was perceived as more cost-effective. In conclusion, psychological needs shape ODR usage and are crucial for designing such services.",

Driver distraction, often caused by drivers performing Non Driving Related Tasks (NDRTs), is a major contributor to vehicle crashes. Accordingly, in-vehicle UI s must be evaluated for their distraction potential. Computational models are a promising solution to automate this evaluation, but are not yet widely used. limit their real-world impact. We systematically review the existing literature on computational models for NDRTs to analyze why current approaches have not yet found their way into practice. We found that while many models are intended for UI evaluation, they focus on small and isolated phenomena that are disconnected from the needs of automotive UI designers. In addition, very few approaches make predictions detailed enough to inform current design processes. Our analysis of the state of the art, the identified research gaps, and the formulated research potentials can guide researchers and practitioners towards computational models that improve the automotive UI design process.",

However, their lack of societal acceptance remains a challenge. Therefore, we must consider ways to promote prosocial behavior with micromobility interactions. We investigate how post-ride feedback can encourage the prosocial behavior of e-scooter riders while interacting with sidewalk users, including pedestrians and delivery robots. Using a web-based platform, we measure the prosocial behavior of e-scooter riders. Results found that post-ride feedback can successfully promote prosocial behavior, and objective measures indicated better gap behavior, lower speeds at interaction, and longer stopping time around other sidewalk actors. The findings of this study demonstrate the efficacy of post-ride feedback and provide a step toward designing methodologies to improve the prosocial behavior of mobility users.",

This paper investigates the effectiveness of AR applications for assisting pedestrians in crossing scenarios, against traditional crossing methods, by incorporating a collision warning system that uses an arrow to indicate the direction of a potential danger, and a virtual traffic light showing whether it is safe to cross. By leveraging Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications within the living lab of Aveiro, Portugal, we conducted a user study to evaluate involved workloads, perceived safety and system usability in a realistic scenario. The findings from our study involving 20 participants reveal significant improvements in pedestrians’ perceived safety and a decrease in the perceived workload when using AR for pedestrian crossings, with both collision warning systems and virtual traffic lights demonstrating excellent usability.",

      "abstract": "We review the state of open science and the perspectives on open data sharing within the automotive user research community. Openness and transparency are critical not only for judging the quality of empirical research, but also for accelerating scientific progress and promoting an inclusive scientific community. However, there is little documentation of these aspects within the automotive user research community. To address this, we report two studies that identify (1) community perspectives on motivators and barriers to data sharing, and (2) how openness and transparency have changed in papers published at AutomotiveUI over the past 5 years. We show that while open science is valued by the community and openness and transparency have improved, overall compliance is low. The most common barriers are legal constraints and confidentiality concerns. Although research published at AutomotiveUI relies more on quantitative methods than research published at CHI, openness and transparency are not as well established. Based on our findings, we provide suggestions for improving openness and transparency, arguing that the motivators for open science must outweigh the barriers.

      "abstract": "While the introduction of automated driving is intended to make driving safer and more comfortable, it may also make the interaction between user and vehicle more complex and prone to confusion. It is therefore important to be able to assess to what extent ADSs provide their users with clear and unambiguous information concerning system state and concerning allowed or expected actions from the side of the user. In this project, we have developed a questionnaire to measure whether the information provided by an ADS to its user is experienced as clear and unambiguous. The questionnaire consists of nine items, which were shown to discriminate between good and bad HMI designs in terms of user perception and comprehension. The development and evaluation of this questionnaire was done in several steps. First, a set of 15 questionnaire items was developed that could be presented as Likert scale items on a 7 point scale. Next, an online survey was conducted to test the reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaire as well as explore underlying factors. Data analysis showed that responses on some of the items were highly correlated. A subset of 9 items was found to be able to discriminate well between HMIs with different levels of clarity and (un)ambiguity. Exploratory factor analysis revealed two underlying factors, which could be interpreted to relate to perception and comprehension of HMI information. In the final step, the 9-item questionnaire was tested in an experimental setup. 23 Participants were presented with movie clips of transitions from or to automated driving, including a view of the traffic situation (through the windshield) and of the instrument cluster and steering wheel. Again, HMIs were designed to be either clear and unambiguous or unclear/ambiguous. The results showed that the questionnaire discriminated reliably between both versions of the HMI. As in the online survey, high reliability and internal consistency were observed. Additionally, qualitative measurement of user experience by means of Product Reaction Cards also showed clear differences between the two different HMI versions. ",

      "abstract": "Conditionally automated driving systems face two main safety challenges: the inability to autonomously handle all situations the vehicle encounters, and the allowed inattention of drivers during these critical moments. Our study focuses on enhancing drivers’ situation awareness at such times by embedding information about system status and the road environment in the visual signals displayed when control is transferred from the automated driving system. Six visual signals, each including different levels of situation awareness information, were compared to examine how they influence drivers’ levels of situation awareness in a simulated environment. The results show that signals incorporating higher levels of situation awareness information about the environment significantly facilitate the recovery of situation awareness after engaging in non-driving related tasks. This research provides insights into how visual cues can be optimized to facilitate quicker recovery of situation awareness for drivers transitioning from non-driving tasks in conditionally automated vehicles.",

As honks often mark problems, this focus allows us to better understand the challenges that AVs face in real traffic. Performing a sequential video analysis of 63 honk incidents uploaded by Tesla beta testers on YouTube, we identify how problematic situations emerge as honkable Traffic Gestalts. We identify four types of situated problems with AV driving performance marked by other drivers’ honks: they may wait too long, steer inconsistently, stop instead of going, and go too fast. We further show how a honk may be understandable as a warning, a nudge or a reprimand.  Our work suggests designing honks for AVs to focus on relevant contexts, supported by developing bidirectional interfaces and audio analysis methods that consider the interplay of auditory and visual information in traffic.",

The technology scan focused on touchscreen devices that are installed as original equipment in new and recent passenger vehicles (i.e., from 2020-2024). Relevant data was extracted from owner’s manuals, manufacturer websites, and online videos. Results indicate a trend towards larger touchscreens in the last five years and the moving of functions (e.g., climate control, audio entertainment, primary vehicle controls) from physical buttons to touchscreens. Based on findings from human factors literature, these trends may have a negative impact on road safety. For example, moving primary vehicle controls and infotainment tasks to touchscreens may result in increased distraction and impaired driving performance. Insights about consumer recalls related to touchscreens are also reported.",

      "abstract": "The design of self-driving vehicles requires an understanding of the social interactions between drivers in resolving vague encounters, such as at un-signalized intersections. In this paper, we make the case for social situation awareness as a model for understanding everyday driving interaction. Using a dual-participant VR driving simulator, we collected data from driving encounter scenarios to understand how (N=170) participant drivers behave with respect to one another. Using a social situation awareness questionnaire we developed, we assessed the participants' social awareness of other driver’s direction of approach to the intersection, and also logged signaling, speed and speed change, and heading of the vehicle. Drawing upon the statistically significant relationships in the variables in the study data, we propose a Social Situation Awareness model based on the approach, speed, change of speed, heading and explicit signaling from drivers.",

      "abstract": "Human-machine interfaces (HMIs) are important for the introduction of automated vehicles (AVs). Even though interactions can involve multiple users and modes of transportation, current research and ideation for HMIs are often directed at only one road user group. This reductionist approach goes against the principles of design, which argue for a holistic understanding. To address this gap, we conducted a novel role-switching approach where participants explored a traffic scenario from four roles: pedestrian, cyclist, driver of a manually-driven vehicle and passenger of an AV. After experiencing all roles, participants evaluated each role and generated HMI designs. Results demonstrate that the roles were perceived differently and that switching between these different perspectives contributed to participants' understanding of the traffic scenario and the generated designs. This paper reports insights on the value of a role-switching approach to promote the future development of a more holistic approach towards HMIs.",

Traditionally, vehicle interior lighting has been static and functional, but recent advancements have shifted towards mood-enhancing lighting. With AI technologies becoming integral to vehicles, sophisticated and intelligent interaction experiences are essential. This study uses the Volkswagen ID series' dynamic lighting feature to examine dynamic mood lighting as a tool for intuitive, non-intrusive communication. We assess the effectiveness and limitations of various lighting sequences through quantitative and qualitative methods. Our findings reveal key insights into user preferences and challenges, providing a framework for designing adaptive interior lighting systems. The results highlight the importance of user-centred design in enhancing driving experiences and offer directions for future research in automotive human-computer interaction.",

The European New Car Assessment Programme developed an algorithm that triggers warnings upon detecting distraction.  Previous research showed that off-road glances during lane changes triggered warnings and drivers had difficulties understanding why these warnings occurred. Therefore, a simulator study was conducted in which drivers performed an overtaking maneuver in dense traffic. The DMS was either inactive and did not generate any warnings, or it was active and triggered warnings with or without being instructed beforehand. Results revealed that in 50 % of the overtaking maneuvers driving-related distraction was recorded. There was a significant difference between whether the DMS was inactive, active or instructed with regards to warnings. It was observed that side mirror glances, prior to overtaking, paradoxically prompted warnings. Findings indicated the necessity to refine DMS algorithms to discern safety-relevant behaviors from genuine distractions.",

Previous research indicates that passengers desire to influence the AV's behavior in certain traffic situations. However, automation could counter this desire for control by providing more detailed explanations of its behavior and actions. Consequently, this paper investigates the potential relationship between an AV's level of explainability and passengers' desire for control to intervene in certain traffic situations while also examining the impact on passengers’ perception concerning UX, trust, and acceptance of AVs. Preliminary results from a virtual reality driving simulator study $(N = 50)$ indicate that the level of explainability of an AV does significantly influence passengers’ desire to intervene or their perception of control over the vehicle. It can also be observed that the level of explainability significantly impacts the user experience, trust in AVs, and perceived safety. ",

      "abstract": "Physiological measurements have been widely used to study interactions between automated vehicles (AVs) and drivers, yet they have received little attention in AV-pedestrian interaction research. This paper reviews nine articles from a systematic query, outlining the current state and proposing future opportunities for using physiological measurements in this area. Our findings reveal a targeted application of these measures, with gaze fixation predominantly used to assess visual attention and electroencephalogram employed to evaluate emotional valence and cognitive workload. The review highlights the motivation (e.g., supporting the comparison of multiple experimental conditions), implementation (e.g., equipment, physiological indicators, and their inferred states), and impact (e.g., facilitating exchanges with self-reported measures) of using these measurements. Moreover, we offer promising directions for future research, laying a foundation for further incorporating physiological measurements in AV-pedestrian studies and advancing objective and quantitative methods in this field.",

      "abstract": "Automated vehicles will soon be common in traffic, necessitating effective communication with pedestrians. eHMIs facilitate these interactions, but scalable solutions are needed to address various challenges. In urban environments, pedestrians often fail to perceive AVs' intentions, especially when distracted by multitasking, flocking, or using gadgets. This study enhances attention, perception, and safety of inattentive pedestrians through eHMIs using multi-modal targeted communication (conditions P and N). These targeted eHMIs are evaluated against common multi-modal broadcast communication with audio and visual cues (baseline). The study examines situational awareness, intent perception, and perceived safety among pedestrians using mobile phones while crossing streets. Two targeted eHMI variants were tested: one with projection and personalized audio cues (condition P) and another with personalized mobile notifications and audio cues (condition N). A usability study with 28 participants using a mixed-methods approach shows that targeted nudging from eHMIs improves situational awareness, intent perception, and perceived safety among distracted pedestrians compared to broadcast eHMIs. Thus, targeted eHMI systems could improve pedestrian safety and reduce AV traffic time.",

      "abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) in vehicles poses challenges, notably motion sickness. Using matched motion—mirroring actual vehicle movement in VR—can alleviate this. However, such visual cues may be distracting to users. This paper compares acceleration-based cues that only display changes in velocity,  with traditional matched motion(speed-based) on straight roads. The research assesses their effectiveness in reducing motion sickness while potentially offering less distraction. Results show that displaying acceleration only cues in VR can mitigate motion sickness comparably to matched motion while causing fewer distractions. Our design is fully implemented in VR without additional hardware. This can facilitate a broader deployment. Additionally, it emphasizes the delicate balance between reducing motion sickness and preserving user experience.",

Data from six participants, included surveys, driver performance, and electrodermal activity (EDA). Findings revealed that nighttime lane changes had a shorter minimum time-to-collision, indicating higher traffic conflict severity compared to daytime (p = 0.046). Increased driver stress was correlated with decreased time-to-collision (p = 0.039). Drivers prone to mistakes were closer to collisions (p = 0.005), whereas those prone to violations avoided collisions better (p = 0.027). Despite reaching traffic conflict, drivers reported no perception, decision, or planning errors. \"Procedure error\" was the most common cause of failure. The study suggests advanced Human-Machine Interface systems are needed to aid perception and decision-making, recommending future research with larger, diverse samples.",

However, the acceptability of ADAS is often limited by the human-machine interface (HMI) used, due to issues such as perceived usefulness, ease of use and trust of the ADAS operations. This study proposes using a robotic human-machine interface (RHMI) to improve the acceptability of ADAS and explores whether a small humanoid robot or a minimally designed robot is more effective as an RHMI in widely used three ADAS operations: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Lane Tracking Assistance (LTA), and Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM). We conducted three experimental conditions in a driving simulator using a within-subject design: only a conventional HMI (C-HMI), C-HMI and a humanoid RHMI (RoBoHoN), and C-HMI and a minimally designed RHMI prototype (RHMI-P) in a within-subject design. Participants' subjective assessments and eye gaze data were analyzed. The findings indicate that the acceptability of the BSM operation increased with RoBoHoN due to its familiar and human-like appearance. However, the objective measures revealed that RHMI-P increased gaze alertness and was perceived as more competent and trustworthy. This study highlights the importance of incorporating human-like elements and effectively using non-verbal cues when designing an interface for ADAS to improve the acceptability of ADAS operations and increase their usage for safer roads.",

However, camera-based sensing technologies introduce significant privacy concerns. This study investigates the impact of transparent user interface design on user acceptance of these systems. We conducted an online study with 42 participants using prototypes varying in transparency, choice, and deception levels. The prototypes included three onboarding designs: (1) a traditional Terms and Conditions text, (2) a Business Nudge design that subtly encouraged users to accept default data-sharing options, and (3) a Transparent Walk-Through that provided clear, step-by-step explanations of data use and privacy policies. Our findings indicate that transparent design significantly affects user experience measures, including perceived creepiness, trust in data use, and trustworthiness of content. Transparent onboarding processes enhanced user experience and trust without significantly increasing onboarding time. These findings offer practical guidance for designing user-friendly and privacy-respecting in-car health monitoring systems.",

      "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are emerging as the leading alternative to internal combustion engines (ICE) an offer an opportunity to curb emissions, reduce air pollution, and decrease fossil fuel dependence. Key to their successful adoption involves understanding consumer expectations and preferences for EV user interfaces (UIs). This study explores consumer preferences and acceptance of EV UIs, focusing on expectations, perceptions and preferences of aesthetics, design, function, and features. The work presented here is part of a larger project investigating EV adoption in the Australian market and presents a qualitative observation of participants interacting with EVs. Key areas of EV interiors that impact perception and preferences include center console and dashboard, driving controls, button quantity, and screen size. Furthermore, participants expect EVs to have fewer physical buttons, prefer uncluttered UIs, favour large screens, and desire physical buttons for critical functions. These insights guide future automotive UI designs, enhancing EV adoption.",

      "abstract": "As the popularity of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) increases, creating awareness regarding vehicle maintenance becomes crucial. A user-centred approach is necessary when implementing new features as previous research reveals that users have difficulty understanding EV-specific information in the interface. With new legislation requiring BEVs to display the percentage of their battery State of Health (SoH), this study investigates what information should be displayed using a user-centred iterative process by testing it on 15 participants in total. The objective is to improve users' understanding of battery SoH and enhance in-vehicle experience for BEV drivers. Presenting the battery's SoH in the form of a percentage alone was found to be insufficient. The research has led to the development of 11 design recommendations for effectively communicating battery SoH information to BEV drivers.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) are designed to assist drivers by issuing warnings when distraction is detected. However, evidence from other warning systems suggests that warnings may also increase the workload of the driver. This study therefore examined the impact of DMS warnings on drivers' workload, measured by the NASA TLX. Participants performed typical in-vehicle infotainment tasks during driving. For half of the tasks, the DMS was active and triggered warnings, whereas for the other half, it was inactive and did not trigger warnings. The results indicate that warnings, issued by the active DMS, resulted in a significantly higher self-reported workload, particularly in terms of higher perceived temporal demand and lower perceived performance. Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between the self-reported workload and the number of warnings. These findings underscore the necessity of carefully designing DMS to balance the benefits of distraction mitigation and the potential impacts on workload.",

However, their individual application does not provide a holistic impression of VAs, while using all these scales would be time-consuming. Therefore, we present the Short Assessment of Voice Assistants Scale (SAVAS) as a screening instrument, serving as a first step in the evaluation process. Based on a literature review and expert evaluations, we generated an initial item pool and subsequently conducted an online study, involving N = 285 participants evaluating an interaction. An exploratory factor analysis revealed five factors: usability, sociability, transparency, anthropomorphism, and overall visual design with good to excellent reliability values. Our methodological contribution provides a first step towards efficiently investigating users’ attitudes towards VAs. The brief but versatile SAVAS has implications for both industry and academia providing a means to economically assess attitudes on five dimensions.",

This paper underscores the need for a specialized approach in developing recommender systems for in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems, aimed at enhancing the driving experience through personalized, routine-based feature suggestions under appropriate contexts. Through the evaluation and comparison of various ensemble machine learning models, including Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost and CatBoost, our research identifies effective strategies for delivering context-aware recommendations. Moreover, a broad spectrum of IVI and contextual features from real-world driving data have been applied to the proposed algorithms, justifying the efficacy of the models.

Commuting, a potentially \"mindless\" task for seasoned drivers, offers an ideal environment for creative thinking that can be enhanced by mild immersive interactions to improve idea generation. The project integrates psychological interventions tailored for driving, drawing on automated driving advancements to ensure safety and effectiveness. Using a context-aware sensing framework, interactions are timed during appropriate driving scenarios to minimize distraction. The system obtains context data from car sensors and employs generative AI to deliver subtle interactions, enhancing user engagement and idea output without compromising safety. Evaluation includes measuring user engagement and post-drive self-reports to quantify the impact on idea generation and driving performance. This innovation integrates creativity support tools into daily commutes, potentially transforming in-car intelligence systems and enhancing productivity and innovation capabilities.",

This research aims to identify implications for future HMI design by investigating relationships between quality of experience, amount of information and willingness to use autonomous shuttles. An online survey with N = 175 participants indicated that a positive experience increases the propensity to trust in autonomous systems, and preference to use autonomous shuttles over conventional buses. Consequently, HMI should utilize user feedback to create positive experiences, for instance by explaining the behavior of automated driving systems. Additionally, passengers with a higher affinity for technology expressed interest in a greater amount of technical information. To enhance positive experiences here, the HMI and information presentation may be personalized and adapted to each individual user. Encouraging the use of public transportation can help to achieve goals of sustainable mobility.",

      "abstract": " Passengers in autonomous vehicles need to perceive information about the position and size of external objects. This study investigates how hiding external object information can help reduce passenger stress. We propose four image processing patterns, including semi-transparent, bounding box, shadow, and fully concealed, to reduce the amount of visual information while preserving object position and size information to reduce stress and improve situational understanding. We categorized external stressors according to passengers' stress levels and the need for an immediate understanding of the stressors using a VR-HMD simulator. This was done through subjective evaluations based on stress reduction and situation awareness questionnaires. The results from 20 subjects showed that the compatibility index was lower in the group with a higher need for immediate situation awareness compared to the group that prioritized confidentiality. This supports the idea that stressors requiring immediate awareness require both information reduction and situation awareness.",

      "abstract": "Recently, the acceptance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has been actively discussed. However, the impact of an automated driving society varies significantly depending on the stakeholders’ places of residence and work. This paper reports on an educational pilot study proposed at Kogakuin University as part of a Faculty of Engineering course focusing on AVs and public transportation. The aim is to explore reframing AVs development to include urban and suburban elements, and to consider approaches for incorporating DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) in engineering education. This pilot study involved a survey of university students that revealed their attitudes toward AVs and the pain points they encountered during their commutes. Our findings provide foundational insights into the precise needs of an automated driving society. These results indicate that understanding the diverse needs of urban and suburban populations is crucial for the development of effective AV systems and educational programs.",

To understand user preferences for travel information during automated shuttle rides, we conducted an online survey with 51 participants from 8 countries. The survey focused on the information passengers wish to access and their preferences for using mobile, private, and public screens during boarding and travelling on the bus. It also gathered opinions on the usage of Near-Field Communication (NFC) for shuttle bus confirmation and viewing assistance to help passengers stand precisely where the shuttle will arrive, overcoming navigation and language barriers. Results showed that 72.54% of participants indicated a need for NFC and 82.35% for viewing assistance. There was a strong correlation between preferences for shuttle bus schedules, route information (r=0.55), and next-stop information (r=0.57) on mobile screens, suggesting that passengers who value one type of information are likely to value related kinds too.

      "abstract": "As automated vehicles advance towards higher levels of automation, users are increasingly engaged in non-driving related activities, diverting their attention from the road and the vehicle's operations. Even in non-critical conditions where automated driving is routine and uninterrupted, users may experience automation surprise (AS) when they fail to anticipate the vehicle's behaviour, potentially impacting their comfort and acceptance of automated vehicles. To explore AS in non-critical automated driving scenarios from an experiential perspective beyond safety considerations, we conducted a pilot study using a qualitative analysis approach, on-road probing and the think-aloud method. Initial findings indicate an expanded understanding of AS, which can arise in non-critical conditions, accompanied by cognitive and emotional responses. Future research aims to validate and refine the expanded definition through a more comprehensive study and inform the development of effective AS mitigation strategies to improve the general user experience.",

We conducted an online survey study with 136 participants to examine how drivers' self-confidence and confidence in AV, as indicators of perceived driving capability, influence their trust and takeover intention in AVs. Results suggested that confidence in AV had a larger effect than self-confidence. Generally, low confidence in AV predicted lower trust and higher takeover intention, while low self-confidence predicted lower takeover intention. Specifically, low self-confidence predicted higher trust only when confidence in AV was low. Furthermore, we observed similar levels of trust across different self-confidence levels when confidence in AV was high, suggesting a potential ceiling effect of trust on imperfect AVs. Our findings provide a better understanding of human-AV teaming patterns from the perspective of human factors.",

Important voice characteristics such as gender and age have been investigated in robots and in-vehicle systems; however, no study has yet compared their impact on pedestrians' acceptance of AVs through external speech interfaces. Through a within-subjects virtual reality experiment (n=10), we examine five conditions, including synthesised feminine and masculine voices from younger and older adults, alongside a baseline condition without sound. Results show that speech interfaces complement visual cues, generally enhancing pedestrians' acceptance. Further, acceptance was influenced by gendered and aged voices, with female voices being favoured for their perceived likability, intelligence, and trustworthiness. This research enhances understanding of AV external speech interfaces and aids in developing socially acceptable robotic speech designs. Our future work includes involving more participants from a broader age spectrum and cultural backgrounds.",

      "abstract": "As automated vehicles (AVs) progress in driving safely on the road, there is growing concern about the balance and adaptability of their driving styles. This simulator study examines how the driving styles of AVs and human drivers influence drivers' decisions, behaviors, and trust during interactions in a mixed-traffic environment. In chicken game scenarios, we find that AVs with conservative driving styles are more frequently exploited by drivers, while aggressive drivers are more inclined to exploit AVs. AVs with aggressive driving styles significantly influence driver behavior in lateral interactions. Notably, the conservative driving style of an AV increases drivers' trust, while the aggressive driving style does not harm it. This indicates that drivers can have a certain degree of confidence in the behavior of AVs with appropriate aggression. Our findings provide insights into how AV design should incorporate scenario-specific adaptive driving styles to balance driver confidence and AV trustworthiness.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) necessitate a transformation in how pedestrians and vehicles communicate. Existing research largely focuses on unidirectional communication from AVs to pedestrians. However, traffic interactions are inherently reciprocal and social. To lay the foundation for truly bidirectional interactions with AVs, this study maps the diverse scenarios, messages, and gestures used by pedestrians to initiate communication with human drivers in today's traffic. Following an online ethnography approach, we conducted an analysis of 20 Reddit discussions comprising 1,094 comments. Our findings reveal a rich communication landscape where pedestrians use gestures to signal urgency, negotiate space, convey warnings, and express needs beyond basic crossing intent. We highlight individual, cultural, and geographical variations in gestures. Based on this expanded understanding, we propose design implications for AV interactions, crucial for promoting safer, more intuitive, and trust-building communication between pedestrians and AVs.",

This approach leverages a combination of a stable diffusion model and super-resolution techniques to produce panoramic images for autonomous vehicle (AV) simulations and VR/AR applications. By generating detailed panoramic road scenes viewable in a VR HMD, an additional avenue for easily creating and simulating vehicular scenarios is possible. The pipeline utilizes a customized dataset with specifically tailored captions to fine-tune the generation process, ensuring both visual fidelity and contextual relevance. The evaluation framework includes both subjective and objective metrics to assess to the quality and applicability of the generated images. A pilot study determined the generated road scenes to be relatively realistic and acceptable for viewing. Potential applications include the creation of new synthetic scenes for simulating AV scenarios, or training and validation of autonomous systems. ",

      "abstract": "Modern automotive infotainment systems offer a complex and wide array of controls and features through various interaction methods. However, such complexity can distract the driver from the primary task of driving, increasing response time and posing safety risks to both car occupants and other road users. Additionally, an overwhelming user interface (UI) can significantly diminish usability and the overall user experience. A simplified UI enhances user experience, reduces driver distraction, and improves road safety. Adaptive UIs that recommend preferred infotainment items to the user represent an intelligent UI, potentially enhancing both user experience and traffic safety. Hence, this paper presents a deep learning foundation model to develop a context-aware recommender system for infotainment systems (CARSI). It can be adopted universally across different user interfaces and car brands, providing a versatile solution for modern infotainment systems. The model demonstrates promising results in identifying driving contexts and providing contextually appropriate UI item recommendations, even for previously unseen users. Furthermore, the model's performance is evaluated with fine-tuning to assess its ability to make personalized recommendations to new users.",

N = 18 participants were repeatedly exposed to four different driving scenarios in which an authoritative control intervention occurred --- either the automation completely blocked driver control authority (Type 1 intervention) or took control authority away from the driver (Type 2 intervention). No significant change in pupil diameter was observed following the interventions, and neither scenario criticality (p= 0.874) nor the intervention type (p = 0.932) impacted pupil diameter. Multilevel modelling results show (1) marginal significance linking pupil diameter change to participants' prior experience with automated systems and age (2) significant levels of inter-individual variation. To better understand driver arousal during authoritative control interventions, future research should additionally consider factors that cause inter-individual variation, such as other genetic and psychological information.

      "abstract": "The perceived safety of Autonomous Vehicles (AV) is considered a major challenge towards their public acceptance. Here we explore the role of vehicle design in instilling a sense of safety on behalf of prospective passengers. Previous work showed that variations in exterior design affect people’s perceptions although the particular design features driving these shifts in perception were not elaborated on. We aim to identify and validate the relative importance of design features pertaining not just to the vehicle exterior. The work contributes towards the development of a wider Data-Informed-Design (D-I-D) approach to assist designers to make mindful decisions, empower their creativity, and increase design efficiency and effectiveness by sizing or shaping the design space. Based on a series of semi-structured interviews with senior designers, we developed an initial taxonomy of design features. Their relative importance was subsequently validated in a forced-choice experiment in which a panel was asked to judge perceived safety of concept autonomous vehicles including particular design features. Preliminary results indicated that not all features had the intended effect suggestive of a “knowledge gap” on behalf of the designers indicating the potential benefits of a Data-Informed-Design approach.

      "abstract": "When considering novel, futuristic vehicle designs, it is important to consider the technology’s “adoption potential”. Literature suggests that perceived risk is one of the key determinants of trust, which in turn affects adoption potential. Our research investigates how risky the general public perceives different design configurations for futuristic urban mobility vehicles, comparing highly futuristic flying cars to more traditional cars, while factoring in the issue of whether the vehicle is operated manually or autonomously. The initial results indicate that there is a combined effect of the level of autonomy and the driving mode of the vehicle on the way people perceive its riskiness. Further, the “exposure” component of perceived risk could be an important driver of people’s judgments for future technologies. More research is required to establish the main drivers of futuristic, multimodal vehicles’ risk perception.",

      "abstract": "Most of today's studies investigating the driver-vehicle interaction of automated driving systems are conducted in simulated environments like driving simulators or virtual reality. While this simulation-based experimental research can produce valuable and valid results, it is at the same time limited by the inherent lack of realism. Important insights into real-world driving experiences and repeated system usage are rarely collected due to the constraints imposed by time and financial resources. In a multi-step research approach, we aim to connect the AutoUI research with real-world users. In the first step, we conducted qualitative interviews with 10 experienced, tech-savvy users of current automated driving systems (Waymo, Cruise, Tesla) and clustered the results into the most important issues from a human factor perspective.

      "abstract": "This study explored communication designs for driverless automated service vehicles (ASVs) and pedestrians' trust and perceived safety when pedestrians cross narrow roads in residential areas. Forty participants carried out VR experiments that simulated interactions between implicit (vehicle behavior) and explicit communications (text-based external human-machine interfaces (eHMI)) of two ASVs types (bus and golf cart) in residential areas. Results indicated that pedestrians were more likely to trust the bus-type ASV more when it stopped further away compared to decelerating relatively late. Pedestrians' perception of safety varied depending on the type of ASV, with the golf cart type being perceived as safer than the bus type. Further, pedestrians exhibited greater trust when the ASV did not display any messages. However, text messages indicating the ASV’s status, such as \"In Automated Driving,\" improved their perception of safety. This highlights the need for effective communication methods to enhance road user attitudes towards ASVs. ",

We present preliminary findings from a driving simulator study (N=46) that utilised Markov Chain analysis of gaze transitions and gaze dispersion metrics. Results show that NDRTs, particularly on mobile phones, compromise drivers' attention distribution and gaze transitions. While HUDs keep drivers' gaze closer to the road, they may still hinder hazard perception. Markov Chain analysis reveals valuable insights into drivers' attention management, informing the design of safer in-vehicle interfaces for automated vehicles. These findings highlight the need for careful consideration when designing in-vehicle interfaces and NDRT interactions for automated vehicles.",

      "abstract": "In conditional automated driving, the car sometimes has to initiate a take-over. The safety of a take-over depends on the driver’s situation awareness, which may be compromised due to engagement in non-driving related tasks. Light cues can direct the driver's gaze towards critical areas. This study investigates whether light cues also enhance situation awareness. A driving simulation study was conducted to compare situation awareness between a group receiving light cues and a control group. Situation awareness was assessed using the Situational Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT). No significant differences were found between the groups (N = 48). Situation awareness varied across different areas of interest, with near-perfect situation awareness for the speedometer and close to guessing probability for the rear-view mirror. Methodological approaches to assessing situation awareness during take-overs are discussed. Future analyses will examine the effect of light cues on driving behavior as an outcome of situation awareness.",

Addressing the conflicts arising from unfamiliar\r\ntechnology, speed variations, and unpredictable behavior, this survey study with 67 respondents delves into the experience of the local\r\ncommunity and students with the automated shuttles. Results highlight that while a high level of trust in the shuttles is established\r\ndue to their low speed and cautiousness, this feature also leads respondents to choose other modes of transportation, such as cycling or\r\nwalking. To mitigate road conflicts, suggestions include implementing separate lanes, providing more operational and project-related\r\ninformation, and implementing auditory signals to the shuttles. These insights can help shape the future of the project that is extended\r\nto new areas and other researchers working on similar topics.",

      "abstract": "Anthropomorphism in product marketing is particularly prevalent in Eastern versus Western marketplaces, potentially driven by a cultural preference. This trend may extend to the automotive domain, where leading Chinese car manufacturers have already adopted anthropomorphic designs for intelligent personal assistants (IPAs). This paper examines cross-cultural differences in the prevalence of anthropomorphic IPAs, aiming to determine if a disproportionality exists between global markets. The study also explores underlying cultural dimensions (i.e., collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance) that may account for these observed differences. The findings reveal a notably higher prevalence of anthropomorphic IPAs in vehicles by Chinese manufacturers compared to global counterparts. Correlational analyses suggest specific cultural patterns may contribute to the differing prevalence across markets. However, further user studies are necessary to ascertain whether Chinese consumers in fact respond more favorably to anthropomorphic IPAs. This exploration offers first insights that can inform the adoption of anthropomorphic in-vehicle IPAs.",

We extensively study SPIU with external human-machine interfaces (eHMI) on AVs as an integrated solution. To discuss interaction barriers and enhance pedestrian safety, we engaged 25 participants aged 18-40 to brainstorm design solutions for Pedestrian-AV interactions, emphasising effectiveness, simplicity, visibility, and clarity. Findings indicate a preference for real-time SPIU interaction over eHMI on AVs in multiple AV scenarios. However, the combined use of SPIU and eHMI on AVs is crucial for building trust in decision-making. Consequently, we propose innovative design solutions for both SPIU and eHMI on AVs, discussing their pros and cons. This study lays the groundwork for future autonomous mobility solutions by developing human-centric eHMI and SPIU prototypes as ieHMI.",

While this simulation-based experimental research can produce valuable and valid results, it is at the same time limited by the inherent lack of realism. Important insights into real-world driving experiences and repeated system usage are rarely collected due to the constraints imposed by time and financial resources. In a two-step research approach, we aim to connect the AutoUI research with real-world users. In the first step, we conducted qualitative interviews with 10 experienced, tech-savvy users of current automated driving systems (Waymo, Cruise, Tesla) and clustered the results into the most important topics from a human factor perspective. On this basis, the workshop now aims to bring these insights into the AutoUI research community to identify the most relevant and urgent issues that should be addressed in the coming years.",

      "abstract": "In-car interfaces are the primary medium for communication between the occupants and the increasingly agentic vehicle systems.  Although many universities teach automotive user experience and design courses, there is no consensus on what topics to cover. Some schools may choose to focus on the interior design of the cabin, including, but not limited to, physical controls and ergonomics, while other schools may just focus on the usability of what is shown to the driver and passengers. Participants in our workshop will discuss various topics for teaching Automotive UX and UI at both undergraduate and graduate levels, participating in interactive activities such as panels, breakout discussions, and syllabus design. Participants will then combine and form their findings into a course outline based on themes (ex., UI, Human Factors, etc.). This workshop is expected to achieve general consensus on an Automotive UX curriculum drawing from diverse stakeholders, including academia, industry, and government.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies aim for fully self-driving cars but still require human intervention for edge-case road scenarios. Remote human operation can mitigate AV shortcomings through two major teleoperation paradigms: remote driving (tele-driving) and remote assistance (Tele-assistance). Tele-driving involves a remote operator (RO) continuously controlling the vehicle, while tele-assistance allows the RO to make high-level decisions by delegating the execution to automation. Tele-driving is complex, mostly due to the physical disconnect between the RO and the AV and latency. Tele-assistance faces unresolved design, implementation, and regulatory challenges. This workshop provides a platform for researchers and practitioners to explore teleoperation challenges and opportunities. Participants will address teleoperation methods and design innovative remote AV operation paradigms through interactive activities, discussions, and poster sessions. The workshop aims to explore teleoperation challenges, create a teleoperation paradigm-scenario mapping, and generate novel concepts and interaction methods for resolving edge-case road scenarios.",

Training, information, and education for drivers are methods that may address these gaps. Researchers have assessed the preliminary efficacy of ADAS training and education among various driving populations via the use of different training processes, content, and medium. However, training drivers to understand and use ADAS is a complex, multifaceted process, that is influenced by multiple factors, making it difficult to draw conclusions from the current state of the literature. Developing a framework examining the various factors and their interactions would be of benefit to the driver safety community and facilitate the development of new ADAS training and education by stakeholders. The main goal of this workshop is to establish a framework and identify tools that can be used to optimize the effectiveness of ADAS training and education. Discussions among participants will inform the framework, which is intended to improve user understanding and usage of ADAS systems and lead to safe and responsible use.",

      "abstract": "Most vehicles on the road today range from SAE Level 1 to 3 automated vehicles, where Level 3 automated vehicles can handle most of the driving tasks on the road. However, there are still moments when drivers need to prepare to take over the vehicle, such as when an object suddenly appears in the middle of the road. To respond to these critical events in time, multimodal displays have been introduced in instructional and informational formats. However, the effects of multimodal displays during takeovers for people with hearing impairments have yet to be studied. To address this, we investigated how signal type (single-modal vs. multimodal), informational type (instructional vs. informational), and hearing impairment (hearing-impaired and non-hearing-impaired drivers) can impact drivers’ takeover performance. These study findings can be used when implementing multimodal displays in automated vehicles for drivers with hearing impairments.",

During the pandemic, limited service platforms were available, resulting in an increase in Internet usage and online communication among users. As the pandemic recedes, online activities are transitioning offline. However, the lack of secure and safe meeting spaces has limited face-to-face interactions. To address this problem, we propose an autonomous purpose-built vehicle design and related services for local communities. By configuring a space based on a vehicle, scalability and mobility can be ensured. In addition, the space was planned to accommodate diverse people. Subsequently, we explored additional ways to provide a comfortable community space for a variety of people.",

We collected detailed driving and interview data from chauffeurs, who are known for their smooth and comfortable driving styles. A Two-Step deceleration profile was derived from this data. Two different versions of the Two-Step Profile (V1 and V2), along with a One-Step profile, were integrated into an HAV and tested in various driving scenarios with 36 participants. Participants experienced each profile twice: once while attentive and once while engaged in a non-driving activity. By transferring the chauffeur's driving style to an HAV, this study evaluates the feasibility and comfort of human-like driving patterns in automated systems. The findings provide valuable insights for designing HAVs that prioritize passenger comfort, bridging the gap between human driving expertise and automated technology.",

This work examines how XAI and HCI can improve user trust through visual text design in L3 automated vehicles. We aim to develop user interfaces (UIs) that make AI-driven vehicle decisions more transparent and understandable. Employing a mixed-methods approach (TiA scale, qualitative feedback) in a between-groups design (n=12 participants), we combine empirical analyses with UX design principles.\r\nThe study indicates that effectively communicating AI processes through visual texts in UIs can bridge the gap between complex algorithms and user understanding, thus fostering trust. Results further indicate that contextual, clear, and expected multimodal interaction enhances user trust and understanding of automated systems. These findings are crucial for developing future automated systems in a user-centered manner.",

However, the adoption and proper use of such systems largely depend on a driver's understanding of the system's capabilities and limitations. Currently available automated vehicles on the road generally lack explanations for users to understand system malfunctions and incapabilities, which results in user confusion and prevents users from using the system. Additionally, those systems often do not disclose their operational domain, which might make users develop unrealistic reliance on driving automation systems. Providing meaningful explanations is considered as a solution to address those issues. The presented video first showcases some dilemmas that users might encounter while using driving automation systems, followed by scenarios showing explanation options and potential user reactions. With this video, we anticipate eliciting in-depth discussions on how to effectively construct explanations for future automated vehicles. ",

However, traditional driving simulators are not well-suited to studying traffic interactions with various degrees of freedom in a way that allows for the capture of nuances in implicit and explicit interactions, e.g. gestures, body language, and movement. We developed a multi-participant virtual reality (VR) driving simulation platform to study these interactions. This portable system supports cross-cultural experiments by modeling diverse scenarios, generating analyzable data, and capturing human behaviors in traffic. Our interactive demo allows participants to experience roles as drivers or pedestrians in a shared virtual environment, with the goal of providing a hands-on experience with this open-source VR simulator and demonstrating its affordability and scalability for traffic interaction studies to researchers and practitioners.",

We intend to identify real-world scenarios where these interactions can be implemented, discuss the challenges and opportunities they present, and develop actionable strategies for their application. We will use speculative design methods such as design fiction and anticipatory ethnography to envision alternative future mobility practices. This holistic approach aims to create a comprehensive understanding of how technology can shape sustainable and inclusive mobility ecosystems, and critique the current practices. By bringing together researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders from various disciplines, we hope to foster a collaborative network that will drive future advancements in sustainable mobility.

This integration will likely impact their societal acceptance as well. While traditional methods of evaluating safety may be needed,  consideration for the overall well-being of traffic participants is necessary. Transportation engineering and psychology researchers have considered the well-being of the overall travel experience. However, these methods need to consider well-being while interacting with mobilities. In the proposed workshop, we plan to define and characterize more precisely what should be considered while thinking about the well-being of traffic participants, how future interactions with semi-autonomous or automated mobility systems will interact in shared spaces, and the design considerations to facilitate cooperative interactions. Through this workshop, the organizers look to integrate the findings into a research agenda, which can lead to future collaborations initiated during this event.",

      "abstract": "There are many conversations among researchers associated with the limited utility of the SAE Levels of Automation (LoAs) for defining behavioral-related research questions. The goal of this workshop is to examine these issues and to present a complementary framework to describe the interactions between people and automation, to account for the differences in capabilities between the human operator and the autonomous system, and to match the user’s expectation to system capabilities. This workshop will identify considerations for research and design that is neglected in the SAE framework. It will help address the interaction between human and automation in a more adequate way for human-centered designs.",

These scenarios provide unique opportunities for novel applications, as the vehicle motion can be used to create and enhance movement- and location-based experiences. The daily commute can be turned into a spaceship shooting game, where the journey of the player's ship follows the motion of the car. But we can also use perceptual manipulation - altering the virtual motion - to give the sensation of moving in very different ways to reality, making even a daily commute feel different each time. This demo will let attendees play a VR shooting game in a moving car, where we detect the motion of the vehicle and apply translational gain (amplified forward motion) and rotational gain (amplified turning) to make it feel like a 460km/h spaceship journey with varied turns.",

      "abstract": "The complexity of automotive user interfaces impacts cognitive load and situation awareness of drivers. The aim of the present study is to empirically investigate the relationship between the complexity of the infotainment system in manual vehicles and driver situation awareness. In this experiment we compare the differences between a simple and a complex infotainment system, comparing the independent variable of infotainment system complexity at two levels (low and high complexity) within a simulated driving environment. The Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) was utilized to measure situation awareness in a sample of n=6 licensed drivers, this work is an exercise as part of a lecture. Our findings indicate a variation in SAGAT scores between the two complexity conditions, though there is no statistical differences. These findings indicate the necessity of balancing infotainment system complexity with user-centered design principles to enhance driver safety in manual vehicles. The study advocates for more extensive and diverse investigations in future research.",

The Dynamic Interior Light prototype, an actuated projection unit with a sensor array, was fabricated and integrated into a production vehicle to demonstrate the various additional functionalities that we created. Utilizing Unity, a variety of use cases were developed and implemented. Some of these use cases are more passive interactions (e.g. displaying a message on a seat or creating an atmospheric scene) while others are more active (e.g. playing a game or Body UI). The Dynamic Interior Light prototype demonstrates that this type of system can be implemented in a vehicle to provide a novel, unique, and useful interaction paradigm. However, additional considerations are necessary to address the various challenges for this concept.",
