    <section><h2>Footprints of Travel: AIoT and AR Enhanced Tourist Gaming Experience in Unmanned Cultural Sites</h2><p>Footprints of Travel is a game that enhances cultural attraction experiences for tourism and space management, utilizing Augmented Reality (AR) and the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). This "unmanned" approach diverges from traditional museum-focused models, creating personalized, city-wide cultural experiences with comprehensive information services. Our game is tailored for navigating cultural sites, recognizing crowds, and dynamically processing data within the context management framework. The application enhances safety and comfort through temperature control, smoke detection, automatic fans, and artifact protection. We aim to offer a sustainable, interactive exploration game of historical sites, benefiting visitors and site managers. This AR and AIoT game innovatively enhances the visitor experience and blends technology with cultural preservation.</p></section><section><img src='https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse2.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.QLqXkPgq0w2v2UWr65pCDQHaGN%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=ef1bcaa7c989cf96224ba97650260b8de4150dcfebdc19a3f90332aa8e008136&ipo=images' alt='Figure'></section><section><img src='https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.x1jAFSie6TXWtJs-S_YfNQHaDW%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=511b36ecc7a38f7d4e1039115e04f026c67f738892bba31f77c91b9980b90f43&ipo=images' alt='Figure'></section><section><img src='https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse4.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.kQ0qlxYZ82Dv6MC7_CWmSQAAAA%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=9a07fdc6c148b212b83e7c1283b61aa5d121d20a1fa59c950b059b2fcfbc40f4&ipo=images' alt='Figure'></section>
